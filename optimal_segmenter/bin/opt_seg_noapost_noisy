muriel inn
charles francois bienvenu my field as bishop of she was an old man of about seventy five years of age he had occupied these words in xe
although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous it merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various tumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese
true or false that which is said of men often occupied as important a place in their lives and above all in their destinies as that which they do
m
muriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of six hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar
it was said that his father de shining him to be the heir of his own post had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families
in spite of this marriage however it was said that charles muriel created a great deal of talk
he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry
the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed
m
charles muriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution
there his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered
he had no children
what took place next in the fate of j
muriel
waste in the midst of these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes would not stake by striking at his existence and his fortune
no one could have told all that was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest
ibm
muriel was the cure of nbr of holies
he was already advanced in years and lived in a very retired manner
about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his curacy just what is not precisely known took him to paris
among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was j
pe cardinal beach
one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle the worthy sure who was waiting in the anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed
napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man turned round and said abruptly who is this good man who is staring at me
site saicm
muriel you are looking at a good man and i ate great man
each of us can profit by it
that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and some time afterwards m
n trial was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop off what truth was there after all on the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m
no one knew
very few families had been acquainted with the muriel family before the revolution
h
muriel had to undergo the date of every newcomer in a little town where there are many mouths which talk and very few heads which think
he was obliged to undergo in although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop
but after all the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only noise sayings words less than words la la brea as the energetic language of the south expresses it
however that maybe after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in call the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion
no one would have dared to mention them no one would have dared to recall them
m
muriel had arrived are accompanied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptist one who was his sister and ten years his junior
their only domestic was a female servant of the same areas mademoiselle baptist one and named madame magloire who after having been the servant of m
lesure now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur
mademoiselle baptist one was a long pale thin gentle creatures he realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems that a woman must needs be another in order to be venerable
she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparen stand as she advances in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness
what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this dial man with allowed the angel to be seen
she was a soul rather than a virgin
madame magloire was a little fat white old woman corpulent and bustling always out of breath in the first place because other activity and in the next because of her asthma
on his arrival m
muriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop immediate or after a major general
the mayor and the president paid the first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the general and the prefect
the installation over the town waited to see its bishop at work
chapter ii m
muriel becomes m
welcome the episcopal palace off adjoins the hospital
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m
henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris abba of si more who had been bishop of sin
this palace was a genuine self morial residence
everything about it had a transair the apartments of the bishop the drawing rooms the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees
in the dining room along and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened in the gardens m
the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable day etteth of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble
the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden
three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital
the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house
monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you at the present moment
twenty six monseigneur
that was the number which i counted said the bishop
the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other
that is what i observed
the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficul by that the air can be changed in them
so it seems to me
and then when there is a day of sun the garden is very small for the convalescents
that was what i said to myself
in case of epidemics we have had the typhus never this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at times we know not what to do
that is the thought which occurred time
what would you have monseigneur
said the director
this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the ground floor
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital
monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold
exclaimed the stupefied director
the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes
it would hold full twenty beds said head though speaking to himself
then raising his voice hold non distr the director of the hospital i will tell you something
there is evidently a mistake here
there are thirty six of you in five or six small rooms
there are three of us here and we have room for sixty
there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours
give me back my house you are at home here
m
my risk had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution
his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage
m
muriel received from the state in his quality of bishops salary of fifteen thousand francs
on the very day when he took up his above in the hospital m
muriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner
we transcribe here a note made by his own hand note on the regulation of my household expenses
for the little seminary
livres society of the mission
for the lazarus tape mont didier
seminary for foreign missions in paris
congregation of the holy spirit
religious establishments of the holy land
charitable maternity societies
extra for that of arles
work for the amelioration of prisons
work for the relief and delivery of prisoners
to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the diocese
public granary of the hautes alpes
congregation of the ladies off of manosque and if sister on for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls
for the poor
my personal expenses
total
m
muriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied these for dad has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptist one
this holy woman regarded monseigneur off as a time and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church
she simply loved and generated him
when he spoke she vowed when he acted she yielded her adherence
their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little
it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptist one made fifteen hundred francs a year
on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted
and when a village curate came for the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptist one
one day after he had been ind about three months the bishop said and still i am quite cramped with it all
i should think so
exclaimed madame magloire
monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese
it was customary for bishops in former days
hold
cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire
and he made his demand
some time afterwards the general coun vol took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading allowance tom
the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town off wrote tom
buy it felt same neu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines expenses of carriage
what can be done with it on a town of less than four thousand inhabitants
expenses of journeys
what is the use of these trips in the first place
next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts
there are no roads
no one travels otherwise than on horseback
even the bridge between durance and chateau arnoux can barely support is teams
these priests are all this greedy and avaricious
this man played the good priest when he first came
now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a posting chaise he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days
on all this priesthood
things will not go well m
le comte until the emperor has freed us from these black capped rascals
down with the pope
matters were getting embroiled with rome
for my part i am for caesar alone
etc
etc
on the other hand this affair at finder great delight to madame magloire
good said she to mademoiselle baptist one monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after all
he has regulated all his charities
no where are three thousand francs for us
at last
that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms expenses of carriage and circuit
for furnishing meet soup to the patients in the hospital
livres for the maternity charitable society of aix
for the maternity charitable society of draguignan
for foundlings
for orphans
total
such wash
as for the chance episcopal perquisites the feed for marriage band dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc
the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy
after a time offerings of money slowed in
those who had and those who lacked knocked ahm
in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress
considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities
far from it
as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received
it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any
then he stripped himself
the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letter s the poor people of the countryside had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenom end of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome
we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to make him
moreover this appellation pleased him
i like that name said he
bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur
we do not aka in that the portrait here with presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original
chapter iii a hard bishopric for a good bishop the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into elms
the diocese of visa fatiguing one
there are very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen thirty two cura di escort to be vicar ships and two hundred and eighty five auxiliary chapels
to visit all these is quite a task
the bishop managed to do it
he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a filter spring cart when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains
the two old women accompanied him
when the trip was too hard for them he went alone
one day he arrived at sends which is an ancient episcopal city
he was mounted on an ass
his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him any other equipage
the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes
some of the citizens were laughing around him
monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i perceive that i shock you
you think it very arrogant in a poor priest for use an animal which was used by jesus christ
i have done so from necessity i assure you and not from vanity
in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked rather than preached
he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples
he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district
in the cantons where they were marsh to the poor he said look at the people of briancon
they have conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their head is shown three days in advance of everyone else
they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined
therefore it is a country which is blessed by god
for a whole century there has not been a single murderer among them
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun
to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devil by a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years
well when the father of a family does the boys go off to seek their fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find husbands
to the cantons which has a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras
there are three thousand souls of them
mon dieu
it is like a little republic
neither judge not bailiff is known there
the mayor does everything
he alloys the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritances without charge pronounced sentences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple jen
to villages where he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the people of queyras do you know how they manage
he said
since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths can not always support a teacher they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley who make the round of the villages spending a week in this one ten days in that and instruct them
these teachers go to the fairs
i have seen them there
they are to be recognized by the quill pen s which they wear in the core of their hat
those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning and latin have these pens
but what a disgrace to be ignorant
do like the people of queyras
thus he discourses gravely and paternally in default of examples he invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ
and being convinced himself he was persuasive
chapter iv works corresponding to words his conversation was gay and are able
he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him
when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy
madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur
one day he rose from his arm chair and went to his library in search of a book
this book was on one of the upper shelves
as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it
madame magloire said he fetch me a chair
my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf
one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons
she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs
the youngest of the there was to receive from a grandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather
the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts
phone occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de low as relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations
she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin
what are you thinking about
i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st
he exclaimed
what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much with us tm engage in order this to press the tomb into the service of vanity
he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always concealed a serious meaning
in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to dando reached in the cathedral
he was tolerably eloquent
the eu bject of his sermon was charity
he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable
among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m
tenor and who has amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloths edges and woollen balloons
never in his whole life had m
tenor and bestowed aim so many poor wretch
after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old beggar women at the door of the cathedral
there were six of them to share it
one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m
tenor and purchasing paradise for a sou
when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection
once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room of the town there was present the marquis de champ her ciera wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an ultra royalist and an ultravolt air jan
this variety of man has actually existed
when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m
le marquis
the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur
give them to me replied the bishop
and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows
just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result
alas
god gives air token the law cells into them
i do not blame the law but i bless god
in the department of the users in the bad in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch
that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine
they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried cow dung
in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for twenty four hours in order to render its stable
my brethren have pity
behold the suffering on all sides of you
born a provencal be easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south
he said en be
mouse uses sage
asin lower languedoc on team at a class a
as in the basses all espys the un blue nmmu them being ou en from a degrade as in upper dauphine
this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a pity me to win him access to all spirits
he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains
he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms
as he spoke all tongue she entered into all hearts
moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes
he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account
he said examine the road over which the fault has passed
being as he described himself with a smile and a sinner he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the crown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation
he drags it with him and yields to it
he must watch it check it repressor and obey it only at the last extremity
there may be some fault even in this one cience but the fault this committee is denial it is a failbit a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer
to be as aunt is the exception to be an upright man is the rule
see falls in if you will not be upright
the least possible sin is the law of man
now install is the dream of the angel
all which is terrestrial is subject to win
sinisa gravitation
when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly in
oh
he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits
these are hypocrisies which have taken bright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter
he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest
he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husbands the fathers the masters the strong the rich and the wise
he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces
this soul is full of shadows in is there uncommitted
the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel
one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a drawing room
a wretched man being at the end of his resources has coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her
counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch
the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man
she was held but there were no proofs except against her
steal one could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession
she denied they insisted
she persisted in her denial
thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown
he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was receiving her
thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all
the man was ruined
he was shortly to be true data is with his accomplice
they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate
by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wray then a reduced the justice of revenge
the bishop listened to all this in silence
when they had finished he inquired where are this man and woman to be tried
at the court of assizes
he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried
a tragic event occurred at da man was condemned to death for murder
he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank affairs and a writer for the public
the town took a great interest in the trial
on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill
a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments
they sent for the cure
it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine
i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank i too skill and besides it is not my place
this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right it is not his place it is mine
he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him
he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own
he told him the best truths which are also the most simple
he was rather be other friend he was bishop only to bless
he taught him everything encouraged and consoles him
the man was on the point of dying in despair
death was an abyss to him
as he stood trembling in its mournful brink here boiled with horror
he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent
his condemnation which had been a profound shock has in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life
he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and be held only darkness
the bishop made him see light
on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there
he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple ca mail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords
he mounted the humbrol with him he mounted the scaffold with him
the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant
he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god
the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him god raised from the dead him whom man slay she whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more
pray believe enter into life the father is there
when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw a side to let him pass
they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor of his serenity
on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifical ly
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation
this however was a remark which was confined to the drawing rooms
the populace which perceives honest in holy feeds was touched and admired him
as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it
in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination
some admits it like we maistre others exec rate it like beccaria
the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called find i ate it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral
he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers
all social problems erect their interrogation point around this shopping knife
the scaffold is a vision
the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords
in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guide and as though he king part in what is going on
the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it devour sites tables hot drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenters spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed
the almost violent serenity of the tune real moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him
he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself
at him as he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice
this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved i did not think that it was so monstrous
it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law
death belongs to god alone
by what right women touch that unknown thing
in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished
nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution
m
muriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying
he did not ignore the fact that there inlay his greatest duty and his greatest labor
widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord
he understood how to sit down and hold his leave for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child
as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech
oh admirable console r
he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignity it by hope
he said have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead
think motor that which perishes
gaze steadily
you will perceive the living light of your wellbeloved dead in the depths of heaven
he knew that faith is wholesome
he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him there signed man and to transform the grief which gazed upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes its gaze upon a star
chapter v monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long the private life of m
muriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life
the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of sliced would have been a solemn and charming sight for anyone who could have viewed it close at hand
like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little
this brief slumber was profound
in the morning he meditated for an hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house
his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows
then he set to work
a bishop is a very busy man he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his vicars general
he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine prayer books diocesan catechisms books of hours etc
charges to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state on the other the holy see and a thousand matters of business
what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the necessitous the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work
sometimes he dig in his garden again he read or write
he had but one word for both these kinds of toil he called them gardening
the mind is a garden said he
towards mid day when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings
he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long came clad in his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat may which allowed three golden tassels of large billion to droop from its three points
it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared
one would have said that his presence has something warming and luminous about it
the children and the old people came out to the door steps for the bishop as for the sun
he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him
they pointed out his house to anyone who was in need of anything
illustration the comfort orb comfort or here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled upon the mothers
he visited the poor so long as he had any money when he no longer had any he visited the gift
as he made his cassocks last along while and did not wish to have it noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak
this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer
on his return he cited
the dinner resembled his breakfast
at half past eight in the evening he supper with his sister madame magloire standing behind them and serving the mar table
nothing could be more frugal than this repast
if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake it with some fine game from the mountains
every sure furnished the pretext for a good meal the bishop did not interfere
with that exception his ordinary cost consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil soup
thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the sheer of acute he indulged in the sheer of a trappist
after supper me conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptist one and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio
he was a man of letters and rather learned
he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated up on the waters
with this verse he compares three tests the arabic verse which says the winds of god blew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chap said paraphrase of onkelos which renders it a wind coming from god blew up on the face of the waters
in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemais great granduncle to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little world published during the last century under the pseudonym of barley court
sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself
these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them
we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspond ence of lord germain with generals clinton cornwallis and the admirals on the american station
versailles poinsot bookseller and paris pics of bookseller quai des augustine
here is the note on you who are
ecclesiastes calls you the all powerful the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity add rss justice the creation calls you godman calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most beautiful of all your names
it is necessary that we should in this place give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of d chapter vi who guarded his house for him the house in which he lived conducted as we have said of a ground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above
behind the house was a gardens quarter of an acre in extent
the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below
the first room opening on the street served him as dining room the second was his bedroom and the third his oratory
there was no exit possible from this oratory except by passing through the bedroom not from the bedroom without passing through the dining room
at the end of the suite in their story there was a detached alcove with a fee for use in cases of hospitality
the bishop offered this bed to country curated whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought for the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar
in addi go into this there was in the gardens stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in which the bishop kept two cows
no matter what the quantity of milk they gave me invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital
i am paying mytights he said
his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather
as wood is extremely dear at when it upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the slashed
here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he calls do this winter salon
in this winter salinas in the dining room there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four straw seated chairs
in addition to this the dining room was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted link in watercolors
out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white galery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory
the most beautiful of altar she said is the soul of an unhappy creature consoles and thanking god
in his oratory there were two straw pcie dieu and there was an armchair also in straw in his bedroom
when by chance he received seven or eight persons at one time the prefect of the general of the staff of the regiment in garrison of several pupils from the little seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable theories key from the oratory and the armchair from the bedroom in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors
a room was dismantled for each new guest
it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer
there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall
mademoiselle baptist one had also on her own room a very large easy chair of wood which had formerly been guided and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been obliged to moist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture
but this would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact that she had only been able to pay by forty two francs and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by denouncing the idea
however who is there who has attained his ideal
a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the bed a hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serve in the shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the other near the bookcase opening into the dining room
the book case was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with hooks the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire
in the chimney stood a pair of fire dogs of iron ornamented above with two garlanded cases and routings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the chimney piece hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the holding had fallen near the glass doors large table with an i just and loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table an arm chair of straw in front of the bed apr led key borrowed from the oratory
two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the sail on each side of the bed
small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chalk it bishop of saint claire the other the abbey our teak vicar general of andean be of grandchamp order of citeaux diocese of chartres
when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left them
they were priests and probably donors two reasons for respecting the h
all that he knew about these two persons was that they had been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his benefice on the same day theft of april
madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellow debt time and attached to the back of the portrait of the anne of grandchamp with four wafers
at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it
this seam took the form of arrows
the bishop often called attention to it now delightful that is
he said
all the roots in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were whitewashed which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals
however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptist one as we shall see further on
before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourne pls
hence this decoration
the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw hats in front of all the beds
altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from top to bottom
this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted
he said that takes nothing from the poor
it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forms and a soup ladle which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth
and since we are now painting the bishop of waste was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a great aunt
when he had anyone to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table
but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed
the garden which has been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in cross form radiating from a tank
another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it
these alleys left behind them foursquare plots rimmed with box
in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop has planted some flowers here and there stood a few fruit trees
madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot
it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets
madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken
the beautiful is as useful as the useful
he added after a pause more so perhaps
this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books
he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming boeing and making holes here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds
he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him
moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency men are not the slightest effort to decide between hour before and the natural method he took part neither with the bias against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus
he did not study plants he loved flowers
he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in these two respects be watered his flower beds every summer evening with a tin watering pot painted green
the house had not a single door which could be locked
the door of the dining room which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison
the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch
all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push
at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de shaw said to them have bolts put on your rooms if that will please you
they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it
madame magloire along have rights from time to time
as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open
on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note am not ia physician like them
i also have my patients and then took have some whom i call my unfortunates
again he wrote do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you
the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter
it chanced that a worthy sure i know not whether it was the cute of soul pub roux of the cure of pomp kerry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an in discretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of anyone who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded
the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodiet it do mining a num vigilant quick stock un team unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it
then he spoke or something else
he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons only be added ours must be tranquil
chapter vii cravat re it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show is best what sort of a man the bishop of dead
after the destruction of the band of gaspard new who had invested the gorges of oil joules one of his lieutenants cravat he took refuge in the mountains
he was first seen at kauai ers then at tuiles
he even pushed as far as a mbr it entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy
his highway robberies laid waste the countryside
the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain
he always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force
he was a bold wretch
in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived
he was making his circuit to chastel q r
the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps
cravat he was in possession of the mountains as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose
therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort
you do not really mean that monseigneur
exclaimed the mayor
i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour
set out
set out
clone
alone
monseigneur you will not do that
there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years
they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds
they own one goa tour of every thirty that they tend
they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain air con little elites with six holes
they need to be told of the good god now and then
what would they say to a bishop who was afraid
what would they say if i did not to
but the brigands monseigneur
hold said the bishop i must think of that
you are right
i may meet the k
they too need to behold of the good god
but monseigneur there is a band of them
a flock of wolves
monsieur lemaire it may be that it is of this very flock of solves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd
who knows the ways of providence
they will bob you monseigneur
i have nothing
they will kill you
an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers
bah
to what purpose
it mon dieu
what if you should meet them
i should get some of them for my poor
do not go monseigneur
in the name of heaven
you are risking your life
monsieur lemaire said the bishop is that really slo
i am not in the world to guard my own life but to guard souls
they had to allow him to do as he pleaded
he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide
his obstinacy was bruited about the count et side and caused great consternation
he would take neither his sister not madame magloire
he traversed the mountain on mule back encountered no one and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends the shepherds
he remained there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching exhorting
when the time of his departure approached me resolved to chant a te deum pontifical ly
he mentioned it to the cure
but what was to be done
there were no episcopal ornaments
they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancient chasuble s of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace
bah
said the bishop
let us announce out te deum from the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure
things will arrange themselves
they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood
all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly
while they were thus embarrassed a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horse men who departed on the instant
in the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cra carte to monseigneur bienvenu
did not i say that things would come right of themselves
said the bishop
then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate god sends the sole of an archbishop
monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile
go for the devil
the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god
when he returned to chastel at the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity all along the road
sasi in the right
the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns from them with his hands full
i set out hearing only my faith in god i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral
that evening before he went to bed he said again let us never vest robbers not murderers
those are dangers from without petty dangers
let us fear ourselves
prejudices are the real robbers vices are the real murderers
the great dangers lie within ourselves
what matters of what threatens our head of our purse
let us think only of that which threatens our soul
then turning to his sister sister never a precaution on the part of the priest against his fellow man
that which his fellow does god permits
let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that scanner is approaching us
let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account
however such incidents were rare in his life
we relate those of which we know but generally be passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment
one month of his year resembled one hour of his day
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate
stolen they had already been elsewhere
half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor
however we make no assertions on this point
chapter viii philosophy after drinking the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice duty he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest
he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his sons in law his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls
everything else seemed to him very stupid
he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of pi fault lebrun
he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop
he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m
muriel himself who listened to him
on some semiofficial occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m
muriel were to dine with the prefect
it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking
we are two augurs
i am going to make a confession to you
i have a philosophy of my own
and you are right replied the bishop
you are on the ber of purple senator
the senator was encouraged and went on let us be good fellows
good devils even said the bishop
naive on are no rascals
i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges
like yourself count interposed the bishop
the senator resumed i hate diderot he is an ideologists reclaimed and a revolutionists believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire
a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux
suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world
manos the eel
then what is the good of the eternal father
the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop
it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow
down with that great all which torments me
hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace
between you and means in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense
i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity
renunciation why
sacrifice to what end
i do not see one wolf imm playing himself for the happiness of another wolf
let us stick to nature then
we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy
let us live merrily
life is all
ah

after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me
have a handful of dust seized by a shadowy and if you can
let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation
let us seek the real
let us get to the bottom of it
let us go into it thoroughly
what the deuce
let us go to the bottom of it
we must scent out the truth dig in the earth for it and seize it
then it gives you exquisite joys
then you grow strong and you laugh
i am square on the bottom i am
ah
what a charming promise
trust to it if you like
what a fine lot adam has

what twaddle all these paradise care
god is a nonsensical monster
i would not say that in the moniteur egas
but i may whisper it among friends

to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow

dear his death believe me
i laugh at the idea of there being anyone who has anything to tell me on that subject
fables of nurses bugaboo for children jehovah for men
no our tomorrow is the night
beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness
you have been sardana papua you have been vincent depaul it makes no difference
that is the truth
then live your life above all things
make use of you do while you have it
in truth bishop i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own and i havent philosophers
of course there must be something for those who are down for the barefooted beggars knife grinders and miserable wrenches
legends chimeras the soul immortality paradise the stars are provided for them to swallow
they gobble if down
they spread it on their dry bread
he who has nothing else has the good
god
that is the least he can have
i oppose no objection to that but i reserve monsieur naive on for myself
the good god is good for the populace
the bishop clapped his hands
he exclaimed
what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism
not everyone who wants it can have it
ah
those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness places sinecures dignities power whether well it iii acquired lucrative recantation a useful treacheries savory caligula tions of conscience and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished
how agreeable that is
i do not say that with reference to you senator
nevertheless it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you
you great lords have so you say a philosophy of your own and for yourselves which is exquisite refined accessible to the rich alone good for all sauces and which seasons the voluptuousness of live admirably
this philosophy has been extracted from the depths and unearthed by special seekers
but you are good natured princes and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffles turkey of the poor
chapter ix the brother as depicted by the sister in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of sand of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instinct seven which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we can not do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptist one to madame the vicomte de devoid chevron the friend of her childhood
this letter is in our possession
d dec
my good madam not a day passes without our speaking of you
it is our established custom but there is another reason besides
just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries how our two chambers hung with antique paper white washed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours
madam magloire has pulled off all the paper
there were things beneath
my drawing room which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and folded and with beams as in hours
this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital
and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers
but my room is the one you ought to see
madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable
the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me
in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night
what shall i say to you
i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train
madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small in jurors repaired and the whole re varnished and my chamber will be a regular museum
she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier tables of ancient fashion
they asked us two crowns of six france each tire told them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany
i am always very happy
my brother is so good
he gives all he has to the poor and sick
we are very much cramped
the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need
we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed
you see that these are great treats
my brother has ways of his own
when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so
just imagine
the door of our house is never fastened
he fears nothing even at night
that is his sort of bravery he says
he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him
he exposed himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it
one must know how to understand him
he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter
here are neither suspicious roads not dangerous encounters nor night
last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers
he would not take us
he was absent for a fortnight
on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and said this is the way i have been robbed
and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him
when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me
at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible
now i have ended by getting used to it
i make a sign non adam magloire that she is not to oppose him
he risks himself as he sees fit
i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep
i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me
i should go to the good god with my brother and my hp shop
it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it dicke to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudence s
but now the habit has been acquired
we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep
if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so
after all what is there for us to fear in this house
there is always someone with us who is stronger than we
the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here
this suffices me
my brother has no longer any need of saying a word home
i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence
that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul
i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family
you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist
they really are a very ancient norman family of the general ship of caen
five hundred years ago there was a raoul devaux a jean de faux and at tomas de gays who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort
the last was guy etienne alexandre and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne
his daughter marie louise married adrien charles de gramont son of the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards and lieutenant general of the army
it is written fausta us and fao usa
good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal
as for your dear sylvan if she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me
she is well works as you would wish and loves me
that is all that i decide
the souvenir which she went through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy
my health is not so very bad and yet i growth in her every day
farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you
a thousand good wishes
baptist one

your grandnephew is charming
do you know that he will soon be five years old
yesterday he saw someone riding by on horseback who had on kneecaps and he said what has he got on his knees
he is a charming child
his little brother is dragging a hold broom about the room like a carriage and saying hi
the bishop off in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact
they trembled but they let him alone
sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards
they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon
at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house
they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared
they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain dates may be put under constraint
thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him
they confided him to god
madame magloire did not say this but she knew it
chapters the bishop in the presence of an unknown light at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding page she did a thing which of the whole town was to be believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits
in the country heard a man lived quite alone
this man we will stare at once was a former member of the convention
his name was g member of the convention g was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of da member of the convention can you imagine such a thing
that existed from the time when people called each other thou and when they said citizen
this man was almost a monster
he had not voted for the death of the king but almost
he was a quasi regicide
he had been a terrible man
they need not have cut off his head if you please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for life
an example in short etc
besides he was an atheist like all the rest of those people
gossip of the geese about the culture
was ga culture after all
yes if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his
as he had not voted for the death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and had been able to remain in france
he dwelt at a distance of three quarters of an hour from the city far from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild valley no one knew exactly where
he had there it was said a sort of field while a pair
there were no neighbors not even passersby
since he had dwelt in that bailey the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass
the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman
nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a soul yonder which is lonely
and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit
for at bottom he shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement
still should the scan of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil
no
but what a sheep
the good bishop was perplexed
sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned
finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd who served the member of the convention in his novel had come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live overnight
thank god
some added
the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out
the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot
with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was hear the lair
he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the wasteland and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern
it was a very low uk top of small and clean with a fine nailed against the outside
near the door in an old wheelchair the arm chair of the peasants there was a white haired man smiling at the sun
near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd law
he was offering the old man a jar of milk
while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke thank you he said i need nothing
and his smile quitted the sum to rest upon the child
the bishop stepped forward
at the sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life
this is the first time since i have been here said he that anyone has entered here
who are you sir
the bishop answered my name is bienvenu muriel
bienvenu muriel
i have heard that name
are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome
i am
the old man resumed with a half smile in that case you are my bishop
something of that sort
enter air
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
the bishop confined himself to the remark i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed
you certainly do not seem to me to be ill
monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover
he paused and then said i shall die three hours hence
then he continued i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws on
yesterday only my feet were sold today the chill has ascended to my knees now i feel it mounting to my waist when it teaches the heart i shall stop
the sun is beautiful is it not
i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things
you can talk to me it does not fatigue me
you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death
it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment
it will be might then
what does it matter after all
dying is a simple affair
one has no need of the light for that
so be it
i shall die by starlight
the old man turned to the shepherd law go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired
the child entered the hut
the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself i shall die while he sleeps
the two slumbers may be good neighbors
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been
he did not think be discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the whole for these petty contradiction for great hearts must be indicated like the best he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen
he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him
this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe
meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished loss only that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust
the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach in connection with any other man
a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even if the law of charity
f calm his body almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist
the revolution had many of these men proportioned to the epoch
in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof
though so near to his end he preserved all the features of health
in his clear glance in his firm to be in the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to disconcert death
azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door
g deemed to be dying because he willed it so
there was freedom in his agony
his legs alone were motionless
it was there that the shadows held him fast
his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light
rat this solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below
there was a stone there
the bishop sat down
the exordium was abrupt
i congratulate you said he in the tone which one uses for a reprimand
you did not vote for the death of the king after all
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
he replied
the smile had quite disappeared from his face
do not congratulate me too much sie
i did vote for the death of the tyrant
it was then one of austerity and we ring the tone of severity
what do you mean to say
resumed the bishop
i mean to say that man has a tyrant ignorance
i voted for the death of that tyrant
that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority rightly understood
man should be governed only by science
and conscience added the bishop
it is the same thing
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very newton in
the member of the convention resumed so far as louis xvi
i voted the end of the tyrant that is to say the end of prostitution for woman the end of slavery forman the end of night for the child
in voting for the republic i voted for that
i voted for fraternity concord the dawn
i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors
the crumbling a day of prejudices and errors cause slight
we have caused the fall of the old world and the old world that case of hi series has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy
mixed you said the bishop
you may say troubled joy and today after that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared
alas
the work was incomplete i admit we demolished the ancient regime indeed a we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas
to destroy abuses is not sufficient customs must be modified
the mill is there no longer the wind is still there
you have demolished
it may be of use to demolish but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath
right has its wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress
in any case and in spite of whatever may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
incomplete it may be but sublime
it set free all the unknown social quantities it softened spirits it calmed appeased enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth
it was a good thing
the french revolution is the consecration of humanity
the bishop could not refrain from murmuring yes
i was expecting that word
a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years in burst
you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something within him had suffered extinction
nevertheless he put a good face on the matter
he replied the judge speaks in the name of justice the priest speaks in the name of pity which is nothing but a more lofty justice
a thunderbolt should commit no error
and he added regarding the member of the convention steadily the whole louis xvii
louis xvii
let us see
for whom do you journ
is it for the innocent child
very good in that case i mourn with you
is it for the royal child
i demand time for reflection
time the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv
an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv
monsieur said the bishop i like not this conjunction of names
cartouche
louis xv
to which of the two do you object
a momentary silence ensued
the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken
the convention art resumed at monsieur priest you love not the cruelties of the true
christ loved them
he seized a rod and cleared out the temple
his scourge full of lightnings was a harsh speaker of truths
it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod
innocence monsieur is its own crown
innocence has no need to be a highness
it is as augustine areas in fleurs de lys
that is true said the bishop in a low voice
i persist continued the convention ar yr you have mentioned louis xvii
home
let us come to an understanding
shall we weep for all the innocent all martyrs all children the lowly as well as the exalted
i agree to that
i will weep with you over the children of kings provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people
i weep for all said the bishop
equally
exclaimed convention aruban did the balance must incline let it be on the side of the people
they have been suffering longer
another silence ensued
the convention art was the first to break it
he raised himself on one elbow took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanically when one interrogated and judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony
it was almost an explosion
yes sir the people have been suffering a long while
and hold
that is not all either why have you must questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii
i know you not
ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and seeing no one but that child who helps me
your name has reached me in a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced i must admit but that signifies nothing clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman the people
by the way i did not hear the sound of your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the form of the roads no doubt
i do not know you i tell you
you have told me that you are the bishop but that affords me no information as to your moral personality
in short i repeat my question
who are you
you are a bishop that is to say a prince of the church one of those gilded men with heraldic headings and revenues who have vast pretends the bishopric of d fifteen thousand francs settled in some ten thousand in perquisites total twenty five thousand francs who have kitchens who have lived iss who make good cheer who eat moorhens on friday who strut about a packet before a lackey behind in a gala coach and who have palaces and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot
you are a prelate revenues palace horses servants good table all these n qualities of life you have this like the rest and like the rest you enjoy it it is well but this says either too much or too little this does not enlighten me up on the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom home
to whom do i speak
who are you
the bishop hung his head and replied vermis sukkah a worm
a work of the earth in a carriage
growled the convention dry
the bishop resumed mildly so belts or
the convention art passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away a cloud
before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me
i have just committed a wrong dir
you are at my house you are my guest i owe you courtesy
you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments
your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them
i promise you to make no use of them in the future
i thank you said the bishop
g resume f
let us return to the explanation which you have asked if he
where were we
what were you saying home
inexorable yes said the bishop
what think you of mad at clapping his hands at the guillotine
what think you of bossuet changing the te deum over the dragon hades
the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel
the bishop quivered under it noreply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bosquet
the best of minds will have their fetishes and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic
the convention art began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breaths interrupted his voice still there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes
he went on let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing
a rejoinder
you think it inexorable sir but what of the whole monarchy air
carrier is a bandit but what name do you give to mont devel
flu quiet rainville is a rascal but what is your opinion as to lamour gonna ville
maillard is terrible but saul chavannes if you please
duchene senior is ferocious but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier
jourdan could tetris a monster but not so great apnea am
the marquis de louvois
what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to another
bear this well in kinds of the french revolution has its reasons for existence its wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better
from its most terrible blows there comes forth a caress for the human race
is bridge is too i have too much the advantage moreover i am dying
and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the convention art concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions
when they are over this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed
the convention act doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop
good can not have an impious servitor
he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race
the former representative of the people made no reply
he was seized with a bit of trembling
he looked towards heaven and in his glance at war gathered slowly
when the eyelid was full the year trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plugged in the depths of you
o ideal
thou alone exist est
the bishop experienced an indescribable stock
after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said the infinite is
he is there
if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist
there is the many
that i of the infinite is god
the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld someone
when he had spoken his eyes closed
the effort had exhausted him
it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him
that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death
the supreme moment was approaching
the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had come from extreme cold be as he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and ice cold hand in his and bent over the dying man
this hour is the hour of god
do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain
the convention art opened his eyes again
a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance
bishop said he with a slowness which probably arise more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my life in meditation study and contemplation
i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs
i obeyed
abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and confessed them
our territory was invaded i defended it france was menace du offered my breast
i was not rich i am poor
i have been one of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver i dined in dead free street at twenty two sous
i have su scored the oppressed i have comforted the suffering
i tore the cloth from the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country
i have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity
i have when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your profession
and there is at pete them in flanders at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of urbanists the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in
i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good that i was able
after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed
for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned
and i accept this isolation of hatred without hating anyone myself
now i am eighty six years old i am on the point of death
what is it that you have come to ask of me
your blessing said the bishop
and he knelt down
when the bishop raised his head again the face of the convention art has become august
he had just expired
the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which can not be known to us
he passed the whole night in prayer
on the following morning some bold and curious persons attempted to speak to him about member of the convention the contented himself with pointing heavenward
from that moment here doubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers
any allusion to that old wretch of an caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation
no one could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did not count for something in his approach to perfection
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries
was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop
there was evidently no conversion to be expected
all those revolutionists are back sliders
then why not here
what was therefore seen there
he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil
one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red cap
oh
oh
it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it inayat
chapter xi a restriction we should incur a great risk of receiving ourselves were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop of a patriotic cure
his meeting which may almost be design she was his union with convention arty left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment which rendered him still more gentle
that is all
although monseigneur bienvenue as far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude
let us then go back a few years
sometime after the elevation of m
muriel to the episcopate the emperor had made him a baron of the empire in company with many other bishops
the arrest of the pole took place as everyone knows on the night of the tutor method july on this occasion m
muriel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris
this synod was held at notre dame and assembled for the first time of the th of june under the presidency of cardinal beach
m
muriel was one of the ninety five bishops who attended it
but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences
bishop of a mountain diocese living so very close to nature in rusticity and deprivation it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly
he very soon returned to she was interrogated as to this speedy return and he replied u embarrassed them
the outside air penetrated to them through me
i produced on them the effect of an open door
on another occasion he said what would you have
those gentlemen are princes
i am only a poor peasant bishop
the fact is that he displeased them
among other strange things it is said that he chanced to remark one evening when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues what beautiful clocks
what beautiful carpets
what beautiful liveries
they must be a great trouble
there are people who are sold
there are poor people
there are poor people
this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts
never the less in churchmen luxury is wrong except in connection with representations and ceremonies
it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them
an opulent priest is a contradiction
the priest must keep close to the poor
is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm
can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace and who has neither a singer hair nor blackened nails not a drop of sweat not a speck of ashes on his face
the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty
this is no doubt what the bishop of d thought
it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the ideas of the century on certain delicate points
he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly pressed it seems that he would have been found to be an ultra montane rather than a gallican
since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline
beginning with behave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations
he refused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days
besides his sister mademoiselle baptist one he had two brothers one a general the other a perfect
he wrote to both with tolerable frequency
he was harsh for a time towards the former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape
his correspondence with the other brother the ex prefect a fine worthy man who lived in retirement at paris due cassette remained more affectionate
this monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud
the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions
let there be no mistake as to our meaning we are not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic humane which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect
without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book we will simply say this it would have been well it monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glance had never been for a single instant turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the fictions and the hatreds of this world above the stormy vicissitudes of human things the beaming of those three pure radiances truth justice and charity
while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just cut perilous resistance to the all powerful napoleon
but that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling
we only love the fray so long as there is sanger and in any case the combatants of the first hour have a love the right to be the exterminators of the last
he who has not been a stubborn accused in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin
the denuncia tor of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall
as for us when providence intervenes and strikes we let it work
commenced to disarm us
in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation
and it was a crime to applaud in in the presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head
in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of the bishop of sought but perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss
with this except ion he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence
he was a priest a safe and a man
it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more so perhaps than we who are speaking here
the porter of the town hall had been placed there by the emperor
he was an old noncommissioned officer of the old guard a member of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist as the eagle
this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches
after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his regimentals as he said so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross
he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and he would not put anything in its place
i will die he said rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart
he liked to scoff aloud st louis xviii
the youth old creature in english gaiters
he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his
he was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detected prussia and england
he did it so often that he lost his place
there he was turned out of the house with his wife and children and without bread
the bishop sent for him deprived him gently and appointed him beadle in the cathedral
in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy deeds and gentle manner s filled the town off with a sort of tender and filial reference
even his conduct towards napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned as it were by the people the good and weakly click who adored their emperor but loved their bishop
chapter xii the solitude of monseigneur welcome a bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little agnes just as a general is by a covey of young officers
this is what that charming saint francois de sales calls somewhere keep refresh lance frcsc allow priests
every career has its aspirants who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it
there is no power which has not its dependents
there is no fortune which has not its court
the seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present
every metropolis us site staff of officials
just as there are big wins elsewhere there are big hit train the church
these are the bishops who stand well at court who are rich well endowed skilful accepted by the world who know how to pray no doubt but who know also how to beg who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy who are abbes rather than priests prelates rather than bishops
happy those who approach them
being persons of influence they create a shower about them upon the assiduous and the favored and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing of large parishes prebend watch i did donates chaplaincies and cathedral posts while awaiting episcopal honors
as they advance themselves they cause their satellites to progress also it is a whole solar system on the march
the irradiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite
their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes into nice little promotions
the larger the diocese of the patron the batter the curacy for the favorite
and then there is rome
a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal carries you with him as conc lavish you enter a court of papal jurisdiction you receive the pallium and behold
you are an auditor then a papal chamberlain then monsignor and from a grace to an eminence is only a step and between the eminence and the holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot
every skull cap may dream of the tiara
the priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner and what a king
the supreme king
then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary
who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation
in good faith perchance and receiving itself devoted that it is
monseigneur bienvenu poor humble retiring was not accounted among the big mitres
this was plain from the complete absence of young priests about him
we have seen that he did not take in paris
not a single future dreamed of eng rafting itself on this solitary old man
not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow
his canons and grand vicars were good old men rather vulgar like himself walled up like him in this diocese without exit to a cardinal ship and who resembles their bishop with this difference that they were finished and he was completed
the impossibility of growing great under monseigneur bienvenu was so well understood that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of a odor of such and went off in a great hurry
for in short we repeat it men wish to be pushed
a saint who dwells on a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor he might communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty anand by locus of the joints which are useful in advancement and in short note renunciation than you desire and this infectious virtue is avoided
hence the isolation of monseigneur bienvenu
we live in the midst of a gloomy society
success that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption
be it said in passing that success is a very hideous thing
its false resemblance to her it receives men
for the masses success has almost the same profile as supremacy
success that he march music talent has one rule history
juvenal and tacitus a line grumble at it
in our data philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service we are the livery of success and performs the service of its antechamber
succeed theory
prosperity argues capacity
win in the lottery and behold
you are a clever man
he who triumphs is generated
be born with a silver spoon in your mouth
everything lies in that
be lucky and you will have all the rest be happy and people will think you great
outside of five or six immense exceptions which compose the splendor of a century contemporary admiration is nothing but shortsighted news
gilding is good
it does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance so long as you do arrive
the common need is an old narcissus who adores himself and who applauds the vulgar here
that enormous ability by virtue of which one is moses aeschylus dante michaelangelo of napoleon the multitude awards on the soot and by acclamation to whomsoever attains his object in whatsoever it may consist
let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy let a false corneille compose girl date let a eunuch come to possess a harem let a military prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe soles for the army of the sambre and meyer and construct for himself out of this cardboard sold as leather four hundred thousand francs of income let a pork packers spouse usury and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions of which he is the father and of which it is the mother let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal crawl let the steward of a fine family bfs priston retiring from servise that he is made minister of finances and men call that genius just as they call the face of no issue ton beauty and the mien of claude majesty
with the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft more of the puddle by the feet of ducks
chapter xiii what he believed we are not obliged to sound the bishop off on the score of orthodoxy
in the presence of such a soul we feel our selves in no mood but respect
the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word
moreover certain natures being given as admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own
what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery
these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where soil center naked
the point on which we are certain is that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case
no decay is possible to the diamond
he believed to the extent of his powers
credo in patten he often exclaimed
moreover he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god
the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love
it was in that quarters kia multum am a bit because he loved much that he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry
what was this excess of love
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things
he lived without disdain
every man even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals
the bishop of chad none of that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless
he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes who knoweth whither the soul of the animal north
hudson dress of aspect deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his indignation
he was touched almost softened by them
it seemed as though he went thoughtfully a way to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation of the excuse for them
he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties
he examined without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature
this revert sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings
one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by tim suddenly he paused and gazed at something in the ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider
his sister heard him say poor beast
it is not its fault
why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness
one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant
this loved this just man
sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing more venerable possible
monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories agent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate and possibly a violent man
his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly thought by thought for in a character as in stock there may exist apertures made by drops of water
these hollow ware une traceable these formations are indestructible
in as we think we have already said he reached his seventy fifth birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty
he was not fall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond of taking longer rolls on foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion
gregory xvi
at the age of eighty held himself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop
monseigneur welcome had what the people terms fine head but so amiable sachs that they forgot that it was fine
when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person
that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon
on the first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine man
but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feelin be holding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile
respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle
as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion almsgiving the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled every day of his life
nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired
it seemed to be a sort of fire with him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens
sometimes if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walkway a very advanced hour of the night
he was there alone communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown
at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take its flight from him and something descend into him
mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe
he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity pasta mystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced their way onto all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the in comprehend i now he gazed upon it
he did not study god he was dazzled by him
he considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms which communicate aspects to matter reveal forces by verifying them create individualities in unity proportions in extent the innumerable in the infinite and through light produce beauty
these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly hence life and death
he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees
this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds was dear to him and satisfied his wants
what more was needed by this old man who divided the leisure of his life where there was so little leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night
was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to score god in his most divine works in turn
does not this comprehend all in fact
and what is there left to desire beyond it
a little garden in which to walk and immensity in which to dream
chapter xiv what he thought one last word
since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop off a certain pantheistic al physiognomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort
that which enlightened this man was his heart
his wisdom was made of the light which comes from there
no systems many works
abstruse speculations contain vertigo not here is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses
the apostle may be daring but the bishop must be timid
he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds
there is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy opening ssh and yawning there but something tells you you a passerby in life that you must not enter
woe to him who penetrates thither
geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation situated so to speak above all dogmas propose their ideas to god
their prayer audaciously offers discussion
their adoration interrogates
this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs
human merit a film has no limits
at his own risk and peril it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzle ment
one might almost say that by a sort of splendid reaction it with it dazzles nature the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is probable that the contemp lators are contemplated
however they may be there are on earth men who are they men
perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revert the heights of the absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain
monseigneur welcome was one of these men monseigneur welcome was not a genius
he would have feared those sub limit is a whence some very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity
certainly these powerful reveries have their moral utility and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection
this humble soul loved and that was all
that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts saint theresa and saint jerome would be heretics
he inclined towards all that groans and all that expiated
the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound
the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in funding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and believe
that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation
there are men who toil at extracting gold he rolled at the extraction of pity
universal misery was his mind
the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness
love each other he declared this to be complete desired nothing further and that was the whole of his doctrine
one day that man who believed himself to be a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop must survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit
your love each other is nonsense
well replies monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself upon it as the pearl in the oyster
thus he shut himself up he lived there he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipices of metaphysics all those profundities which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal the trans formation in death the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains the in comprehensible grafting of successive lives on the persistent i the essence the substance the nile and the end the soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius manoj saint paul dante contemplate with eyes flashing lightning which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there
monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing the band without troubling his own mind with them and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness
book second the fall chapter i the evening of a day of walking early in the month of october about an hour before sunset a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town off the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness
it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance
he was a man of medium stature thickset and robust in the prime of life
he might have been forty six or forty eight years old
a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and fanned by sun and wind and dripping with perspiration
his shirt of coarse yellow line m fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor permitted a view of his hairy breast he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the other an old gray tattered blouse patches on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewer on with twine a tightly packed soldier knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand iron shox shoes on his stocking less feet a shaved head and a long beard
the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated a hole
his hair was closely cutter bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to have been cut for some time
no one knew him
he was evidently only a chance passerby
whence came he
from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance into why the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris
this man must have been walking all day
he seemed very much fatigued
some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade
he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in the marketplace
on arriving at the corner of the rue pouch every he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the town hall
he entered then came out a quarter of an hour later
a gendarme was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants off the proclamation of the gulf jian
the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme
the gendarme without replying to his salute shaded attentively a thin followed him for awhile with his eyes and then entered the town hall
there then existed at racine inn at the sign of the cross of colfax
this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin la barre a major consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another la barre who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble and had served in the guides
it was said that general bette and disguised as a carter had made frequent trips tn other in the month of january and that he had distributed crossed of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of good to the citizens
the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had be taken himself to the three dauphine
this glory of the la barre of the three dauphins was reflected upon the la barre of the cross if colfax at a distance office and twenty leagues
it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble
the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the countryside
he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street
all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazes gayly in the fireplace
the host who was also the chief cook was going from one stew pan to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoner s whose loud talking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment
anyone who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoner s
a fat may not flanked by white partridges and heather cocks was turning on a long spot before the fire on the stove two huge carps from pamela user and a trout from lake all oz were cooking
the most hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said without raising his eyes from his stoves what do you wish sur
food and lodging said the man
nothing easier replied the host
the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered i have money
in that case we are at your service said the host
the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire
c is in the mountains
the evenings are cold there in october
but as the most went back and forth be scrutinized the traveller
will dinner be ready soon
said the man
immediately replied the landlord
while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worth ghost jacquin la barred news of ncil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window
on the white martin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey
the traveller saw nothing of all this
once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon
immediately responded the host
the child returned
he brought back the paper
the most unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply
he seemed to read it attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment
then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to be immersed in reflections a high were not very serene
i can not receive you did said he
the man half rose
what
are you afraid that i will not pay you
do you want me to pay you in advance
i have money i tell you
it is not that
what then
you have money yes said the man
and i said the most have no room
the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable
i can not
why
the horses take up all the space
very well
retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of straw
we will see about that after dinner
i can not give you any dinner
this declaration made in a measured but firm to be struck the stranger as grave
he rose
at
bah
but i am dying of hunger
i have been walking since sunrise
i have travelled twelve leagues
i pay
i wish to eat
i have nothing said the landlord
the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves nothing
and all that
all that is engaged
by whom
by messieurs the wagoner s
how many are there of them
twelve
there is enough food there for twenty
they have engaged the whole or it and paid for it in advance
the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am at an inn i am hungry and i shall remain
then the most bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him start go away
at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron short upon his staff he turned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host based steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop
do you want me to tell you your name
your name is jean valjean
how do you want me to tell you who you are
when i saw you come in i suspected something i sent to the town hall and this was the reply that was sent to me
can you read
do saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town hall and from the town hall to the inn
the man cast a glance upon it
the landlord resumed after a pause
i am in the habit of being polite to everyone
go away
the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure
he chose the principal street
he walked straight omaha venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man
he did not turn found a single time
had he done so he would have seen the most of the cross of colfax standing on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of rising and all the passersby in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust fast by the group he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
he saw nothing of all this
people who are crushed do not look behind them
they know but too well the evil rate shock follows them
thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad
all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply
night was drawing near
he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter
the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble public house some novel however lowly
just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets spine branch suspended from across beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight
he proceeded thither
it proved to be in fact a public house
the public house which is in the rue de chat fair
the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the low studded room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth
some men were engaged in drinking there
the landlord was warming himself
an iron pot suspended from a frame bubbled over the flame
the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by two doors
one opens on the street the other up in a small yard filled with manure
the travellers are not enter by the street door
he slipped into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened the door
who goes there
said the master
someone who wants supper and bed
good
we furnish supper and bed here
he entered
all the men who were drinking turned round
the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other
they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack
the host said to him there is the fire
the supper is cooking in the pot
come and warm yourself comrade
he approached and seated himself near the hearth
he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire a fine odor was emitted by the pot
all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows
it was more over a firm energetic and melancholy profile
this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeking humble and ended by seeking severe
the eyes home beneath it slashes like a fire beneath brushwood
i think it was esco union
now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had requested him to take him on his crupper to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait
this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin la barre and had himself related h i said agreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross off olbas
from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern keeper
the tavern keeper went to him
they exchanged a few words in a low tone
the man had again become absorbed in his reflections
the tavern keeper returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him you are going to get out of here
the stranger turned round and replied gently am
you know
yes
i was sent away from the other inn
and you are to be turned out of this one
where would you have lego
elsewhere
the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of cpl gas and who seemed to be lying in wait for him three stones at him
he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick the children dispersed like a flock of birds
he passed before the prison
at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell
he rang
the wicket opened
turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night
a voice replied the prison is not an inn
get yourself arrested and you will be admitted
the wicket closed again
he entered a little street in which there were many gardens
some of them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the street
in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up
he peered through the kansas he had done at the public house
within was a large white was bedroom with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a double barrel per fun hanging on the wall
a table was spread in the centre of the room
a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter huge mining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking soup tureen
at this tables at a man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was candling a little child on his knees
close by a very young woman was nursing another child
the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling
the stranger paused a moment in revert before this tender and calming spectacle
what was taking place within him
he alone could have told
it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospi table and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps a little pity
he tapped on the page with a very small and feeble knock
they did not hear him
be tapped again
he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that someone is knocking
no replied the husband
he tapped a third time
the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened
he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan
he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which a hammer a red handkerchiefs powder horn and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle as in a pocket caused to bulge out
he carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his full neck white and bars
he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a shout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable
pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that shed yonder in the garden in which to sleep
tell me can you
for money
who are you
demanded the master of the house
the man replied i have just come from put mousson
i have walked all day long
i have travelled twelve leagues
can you
if i pay
i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me
but why do you not go to the inn
there is no room
bah
impossible
this is neither a fair not a market day
have you been to la barre
yes
well
the traveller replied with embarrassment i do not know
he did not receive me
he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall
meanwhile at the words are you the man
the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low to get so marquee
after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinizes a viper the master of the house returned to the door and said clearout
a shot from my gym
said the peasant
then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts
a moment later the window shutter was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
night continued to fall
a cold word from the alps was blowing
by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens which bordered the streets sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of sods
he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden
he approached them units door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which road laborers construct for themselves along the roads
he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a road laborer he was suffering from food and hunger but this was at least a shelter from the cold
this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night
he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut
it was warm there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw
he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so fatigued waste
then as the knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about unbuckling one of the straps
at that moment a ferocious growl became audible
he raised his eyes
the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the dark nec eat the entrance of the hut
he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his tags
he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as is to decouverte
when he had not without difficulty re passed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter without a roof over his head chaser even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone and it appears that a passerby heard him exclaim i am not even a dog
he soon rose again and resumed his march
he went out of the town hoping to find some trevor haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter
he walked thus for some time with his head still drooping
when he felt himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him
he was in a field
before him was one of those low hills covered with close cut stubble which after the harvest resemble shaved heads
the horizon was perfectly black
this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky
meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth
the earth was thus better lighter than the sky which produces a particularly sinister effect and the hull whose contour was poor and means as outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow
there was nothing in the field or on the hill except are formed tree which weighed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer
this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which tends to be sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and be very he turned back abruptly
there are instants when nature seems hostile
he retraced his steps the gates off were closed
d which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since
he passed through a breach and entered the town again
as he was not acquainted with the streets here commenced his walk at random
in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary
as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church
at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment
it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time
worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office
at that moment an old woman came out of the church
she saw the man stretched out in the shadow
what are you doing there my friend
said she
he answered harshly and angrily as you see my good woman i am sleeping
the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was the marquise de ron this bench
she went on
i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man today i have a mattress of stone
you have been a soldier
yes my good woman a soldier
why do you not go to the inn
because i have no money
alas
said madame der i have only four soueif my purse
give it to me all the same
the man took the four skis
madame de g continued you can not obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum
but have you tried
it is impossible for you to pass the night thus
you are cold and hungry no doubt
someone might have given you a lodging out of charity
i have knocked at all doors
well
i have been driven away everywhere
you have knocked at all doors
yes
have you knocked at that one
no
knock there
chapter ii prudence counselled to wisdom
that evening the bishop one after his promenade through the town remained shut up rather late in his room
he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately
he was carefully compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject
his book was divided into two parts firstly the duties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the class to which he belongs
the duties of silage the great duties
there are four of these
saint matthew points them out duties towards god matt
go
b
vii
duties towards animals matt
vi
as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere to sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to young men by saint peter to husbands fathers children and servants in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews to virgins in the epistle to the corinthians
out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls
a moment later the bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him why this book rose from his table and entered the dining room
the dining room was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on the garden
madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the table
as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle baptist one
a lamps hold on the table the table was near the fireplace
a wood fire was burning there
madame magloire email plump vivacious mademoiselle baptist one gentle slender trail somewhat taller than her brother dressed in a town of puce colored silk of the fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted ever since
to borrow guitar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptist one that of a lady
madame magloire wore a white quilted caps gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house a very white fish bluffing out from a town of coarse black woollen stuff with large short sleeves an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks knotted round the waist with a green ribbon with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners coarse shoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles
she concealed her gray hair under a frizz edwin known as the baby wig
madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly aug the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look
so long as monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen and obeyed passively like her mistress
mademoiselle baptist one did not even speak
she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him
she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and a long as she chose but her whole visage her whole person breathed forth an ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning
she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues which mildly warm the soul had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
nature had made her a lamb religion had made her an angel
poor daunted virgin
sweet memory which has vanished
mademoiselle baptist one has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details
at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity
she was haranguing mademoiselle baptist one on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed
the question concerned the lockup on the entrance door
it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places
people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearances suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into their heads to return home page that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters
the police was very badly organized moreover because there was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure each other by making things happen
it behooves wise people to play the part of their own police and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to duly close bar and barricade their houses and to fasten the doors well
madame magloire emphasized these last words but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold
he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and then fell to thinking of other things
he did not take up the remarks topped with design by madame magloire
she repeated it
then mademoiselle baptist one desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother ventured to say timidly did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother
i have heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop
then half turning in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come what is the matter
what is the matter
areas in any great danger
then madame magloire began the whole story a fresh exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact
it appeared that a bohemian a barefooted vagabond a sort of dangerous mendicant was at that moment in the town
he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming
a gallows bird with a terrible face
really
said the bishop
this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire it seemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed she pursued triumphantly yes monseigneur
that is how it is
there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town tonight
everyone says so
and withal the police is so badly regulated a useful repetition
the idea of living in a mountainous country and not even having lights in the streets at night
one goes out
black as ovens indeed
and i say monseigneur and mademoiselle there days with me i interrupted his sister say nothing
what my brother does is well done
there is no need to ask permission
at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door
come in said the bishop
chapter iii the heroism of passing obedience
the door opened
it opened wide with a rapid movement as though someone had given it an energetic and resolute push
a man entered
we already know the man
it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter
he entered advanced a step and halted leading the door open behind him
he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hands rough audacious weary and violent expression in his eyes
the fire on the hearth lighted him up
he was hideous
it was a sinister apparition
madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a crt
she trembled and stood with her mouth wide open
mademoiselle baptist one turned round be held the man entering and half started up in terror then turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene
the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man
as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired them and ested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said in a loud voice see here
my name is jean valjean
i am a convict from the galleys
i have passed nineteen years in the galleys
i was liberated four days ago and am on my way to pontarlier which is my destination
i have been walking for four days since i left toulon
i have travelled a dozen leagues today on foot
this evening when i arrived in these parts i went to an inn and they turned me out because of my yellow passport which i had shown at the town hall
i had to do it
i went to an inn
no one would take me
i sent to the prison the jailer would not admit me
one would have said that he knew who i was
i went into the fields intending to sleep in the open air beneath the stars
there were no stars
i thought it was going to rain and i reentered the town to seek the recess of a doorway
yonder in the square i meant to sleep on a stone bench
what is this place
do you keep an inn
i have money savings
one hundred and nine france fifteen sous which learned in the galleys by my labor in the course of nineteen years
i will pay
what is that time
i have money
i am very weary twelve leagues on foot i am very hungry
are you willing that i should remain
madame magloire said the bishop you will set another place
the man advanced three paces and approached the lamp which was on the table
did you hear
i am a galley slaves convict
i come from the galleys
he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper which he unfolded
yellow as you see
this serves to expel me from every place where i go
will you read it
i know how to read
i learned in the galleys
there is a school there for those who choose to learn
he is a very dangerous man
everyone has cast me out
are you willing to receive me
is this an inn
will you give me something to eat and a bed
have you a stable
madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove
madame magloire retired to execute these orders
the bishop turned to the man
sit down air and warm yourself
we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are sipping
at this point the man suddenly comprehended
the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stupefaction of doubt of joy and became extraordinary
he began stammering like a crazy man really
what
you will keep me
you do not drive me forth
a convict
you call me sir
you do not address me as thou
i felt sure that you would expel me so i told you at once who i am
oh what a good woman that was who directed me higher
i am going to sup
a bed with a mattress and sheets like the rest of the world
aged
it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed
you actually do not want me to go
you are good people
besides i have money
i will pay well
pardon me monsieur the innkeeper but what is your name
i will pay anything you ask
you are a fine man
you are an innkeeper are you not
ian replied the bishop a priest who lives here
a priest
said the man
oh what a fine priest
then you are not going to demand any money of me
you are the cure are you not
the cure of this big church
well
i am a fool truly
i had not perceived your skull cap
as he spoke he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner replaced his passport on his pocket and seated himself
mademoiselle baptist one based mildly at him
he continued you are humane monsieur le sure you have not scorned me
a good priest is a very good thing
then you do not require me to pay
mosaic the bishop keep your money
how much have you
did you not tell me one hundred and nine france
and fifteen sous added the man
one hundred and nine france fifteen sous
and how long did it take you to earn that
nineteen years
nineteen years
the bishop sighed deeply
the man continued i have still the whole of my money
in four days i have spent only twenty five some which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse
since you are an abbe i will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys
and one day i saw a bishop there
monseigneur is what they call him
he was the bishop of major ext marseilles
he is the cure who ruled over the other cures you understand
pardon me i say that very badly but it is such a far off thing to me
you understand what we are
he said mass in the middle of the valleys in an altar
he had a pointed thing made of gold on his head it glittered in the bright light of midday
we were all ranged in lines on the three sides with cannons with lighted matches facing us
we could not see very well
he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear
that is what a bishop is like
while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wide open
madame magloire returned
she brought a silver form and spoon which she placed on the table
madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire as possible
and turning to his guest the night window harsh on the alps
you must be cold air
monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked on the medusa
ignominy thirsts for consideration
this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop
monsieur le fire said the man you are good you do not despise me
you receive me into your house
you light your candles for me
yet i have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate man
the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand
you could not help telling me who you were
this is not my house it is the house of jesus christ
this door does not demand of him who enters whether he had a name but whether he has a brief
you suffer you are hungry and thirsty you are welcome
and do not thank me do not say that i receive you in my house
no one is at home here except the man who needs a refuge
i say to you who are passing by that you are much more at home here than i am myself
everything here is yours
what need gavel to know your name
besides before you told me you had one which i knew
the man opened his eyes in astonishment
really
you knew what i was called
yes replied the bishop you are called my brother
stop monsieur le cure exclaimed the man
i was very hungry when i entered here but you are so good that i no longer know what has happened to me
the bishop looked at him and said you have suffered much
on the red coat the ball on the ankle a plank to sleep on heat cold took the convicts the thrashing s the double chain for nothing the cell for one word even sick and in here till the chain
dogs dogs are happier
nineteen years
i am forty six
now there is the yellow passport
that is what it is like
yes resumed the bishop you have come from a very sad place
listen
there will be more joy in heaven over the year bathed face of a repentant dinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men
if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of goodwill and of peace you are more worthy than any one of us
in the meantime madame magloire had served supper soup made with water oil bread and salt a little bacon a bit of mutton fits a fresh cheese and a large load of rye bread
to table
he cried vivaciously
as was his custom when a stranger supper with him he made them and it on his right
mademoiselle baptist in a perfectly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left
the bishop asked a blessing then helped the soup himself according to his custom
the man began to eat with avidity
all at once the bishop said it strikes me there is something missing on this table
madame magloire had in fact only placed the three sets of forms and spoons which were absolutely necessary
now it was the usage of the house when the bishop has anyone to supper to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the tablecloth an innocent ostentation
madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word and a moment later the three sets of silver forms and spoons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons states at the table
chapter iv details concerning the cheese dairies of pontarlier
this man paid no attention to anyone
he ate with the voracity of a starving man
you are poor i see that plainly
you can not been f navigate
are you really a cure
shift be good god were buy just you certainly ought to be a cure
travelling is hard
if the nights are sold the days are not
i took refuge in franche context first and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands
my wiki was good
i found plenty to occupy me
one has only to choose
there are paper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories on a large scale steel mills copperworks twenty iron foundries at least four of which situated at low sat chatillon at aid in court and at beige are tolerably large
deluxe net who was captain of the gates at pontarlier under the old regime
i worked
they have in the country of pontarlier whither you are going monsieur valjean a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister
it is their cheese dairies which they call fruit is rss
it is towards the end of april that the work of the cheese dairies begins it is towards the middle of june that the cheesemakers drive their cows to the mountains
my brother made him drink that good mauve swine which he does not drink himself because he says that wine is expensive
my brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me
he recurred frequently to that comfortable tradeoff turin as though he wished the man to understand without advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him a refuge
one thing struck me
this man was what i have told you
well neither during supper nor during the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which would remind the man of what he was not of what my brother was
to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convict so that a mark of the passage might remain behind
this might have appeared to anyone else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body and to bestow upon him some reproach seasoned with moralizing and advice or a little commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future
my brother did not even ask him from what country became not what was his history
for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it
no such a point did he carry it that at one time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pontarlier who exercise a gentle labor near heaven and who he added are happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might sound the man
he was thinking no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believe it only momentarily that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way
is not this indeed to understand charity well
is there not dear madame something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon from moralizing from allusions
and is not the truest pity when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all
in any case what i can say is that if he entertained all these ideas he gave no sign of them from beginning to end even gone he was the same as he is every evening and he supper with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m
gedeon le provost or with the curate of the parish
towards the end when he had reached the first here came a knock at the door
it was not better baud with her little one in her arms
my brother kissed the child on the brow and borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother verbaux
the man was not paying much need to anything then
he was no longer talking and he seemed very much fatigued
i understood that we must retire in order to allow this travelled to go to sleep and we both went upstairs
the nights are frigid and that keeps one warm
it is a pity that this ski rudolf all the hair is falling out
my brother bought it while he was in germany at toggling en near the sources of the danube as well as the little ivory handled knife which i use at table
madame magloire returned immediately
we said our prayers in the drawing room where we hang up the linen and then we each retired to our own chambers without saying a word to each other
chapter v tranquillity after bidding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his guest and said to him monsieur i will conduct you to your room
the man followed him
at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed
this was her last care every evening before she went to bed
the bishop installed his guest in the alcove
a fresh white bed had been prepared there
the man set the candle down on a small table
well said the bishop may you pass a good night
tomorrow morning before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our view
hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of says demand without transition he made a strange movement which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it
even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment
did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace
was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself
he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and bending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice am
really
you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this
he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous have you really reflected well
how do you know that i have not been an assassin
the bishop replied that is the concern of the good god
then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head of looking behind him he returned to his bedroom
when the alcove was in use a large serve curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar
the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer
a moment later he was in his garden walking merit sting contemplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which now shows at night to the eyes which remain open
as for the man he was actually do fatigued that he did not even profit by the mice white sheets
snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep
midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment
a few minutes later all were asleep in the little mouse
chapter vi jean valjean towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke
jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie
he had not learned to read in his childhood
jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures
on the whole however there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about jean valjean in appearance at least
he had lost his father and mother at a very early age
his mother had died of a milk fever which had not been properly attended to
his father agree pruner like himself had been killed by a fall from a tree
all that remains who jean valjean was a sister older than himself a widow with seven children boys and girls
this sister had brought up jean valjean and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother
the husband died
the eldest of the seven children was eight years old
the youngest one
jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year
this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlish lyon the part of jean valjean
thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill paid roll
he had never known a kind woman friend in his native parts
he had not had the time to fall in love
he returned at night weary and ate his broth without uttering a word
his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating a bit of me at a slice off as on the gs art of the cabbage to give to one of her children
as he went on eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soul his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it
if their mother had known of this marauding she would have punished the delinquents severely
in pruning season he earned eighteen sousa day then he hired out as a haymaker as laborers and a thereon a farm as a drudge
he did whatever he could
his sister workers iso but what could she do with seven little children
it was a sad group enveloped in misery which was being gradually annihilated
a very hard winter came
jean had no work
the family had no bread
no bread literally
seven children
one sunday evening jaubert isabeau the baker on the church square at face rolled was preparing to go to bed when he heard a violent blow on the heated front of his shop
he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist through the grating and the glass
the arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off
isabeau ran out in haste the robber fled at the full speed of his legs
isabeau ran after him and stopped him
the thief had flung away the load but his arm was still bleeding
it was jean valjean
this took place in
jean valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night
he had a gun which he used better than anyone else in the world he was a bit of a poacher and this injured his case
there exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers
the poacher like the smugglers mac os too strongly of the brigand
nevertheless we will remark cursorily there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns
the poacher lives in the forest the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea
the cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men
the mountain the sea the forest makes a car when they develop the fierce side but often without destroying the humane side
jean valjean was pronounced guilty
the terms of the code were explicit
there occur formidable hours in our civilization there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck
what an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummated the irreparable abandon ment of a sentient being
jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys
on the dog april the victory of montego the win by the general in chief of the army of italy whom the message of the directory to the five hundred of the diff loreal year iv
call a buonaparte was announced in paris on that same day a great gang of galley slaves was put in chains at bicetre
jean valjean formed a part of that gang
an old turnkey of the prison who is now nearly eighty years old still recalls perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line in the north angle of the courtyard
he was seated on the ground like the others
he did not seem to comprehend his position except that it was horrible
it is probable that he also was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man ignorant of everything some thing excessive
while the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer he wept his tears stifled him they impeded his speech he only managed to say from time to time i was a tree pruner at face rolled
then still sobbing he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights and from this feature it was divined that the thing which he had done whatever it was he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children
he set out for toulon
he arrived there after a journey of twenty seven days on a cart with a chain on his neck
at toulon he was clothed in the red cassock
all that has constituted his life even to his name was effaced he was no longer even jean valjean he was number
what became of his sister
what became of the seven children
who troubled himself about that
what becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root
it is always the same story
these poor living beings these creatures of god henceforth without support without guide without refuge wandered away at random who even knows
each in his own direction perhaps and little by little buried themselves in that sold most which engulfs solitary destinies gloomy shades into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads in the sombre march of the human race
they quitted the country
in that heart where there had been a wound there was a scar
that is all
only once during apo the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mentioned
this happened i think towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity
i know not through what channels the news reached him
someone who had known them in their own country has seen his sister
she was in paris
she lived in a poor street rear saint sulpice in the rue du vin dre
she had with her only one child a little boy the youngest
where were the other six
perhaps she did not know herself
every morning she went to a printing office no
rue du sabot where she was a folder and stitcher
in the same building with the printing office there was a school and to this school she took her little boy who was seven years old
but as she entered the printing office at six and the school only opened at seven the child had to wait in the courtyard for the school to open for an hour one hour of a winter night in the open air
they would not allow the child to come into the printing office because he was in the way they said
when the workmen passed in the morning they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement overcome with drowsiness and often fast asleep in the shadow crouched down and doubled up over his basket
when it rained an old woman the port read took pity on him she took him into her den where there was a pallet a spinning wheel and two wooden chairs and the little ones lumbered in a corner pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold
that is what was told to jean valjean
they talked to him about it for one day it was a moment a flash as though a window had suddenly been opened up on the destiny of those things whom he had loved them all closed again
he heard nothing more forever
nothing from them ever reached him again he never be held them he never met them again and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more
his comrades assisted him as is the custom in that sad place
he escaped
he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty of being at liberty is to be hunted to turn the head every instant to quake at the slightest noise to be afraid of everything of a smoking roof of a passing man of a barking dog of a galloping horse of a striking clock of the day because one can see if the night because one can not see if the highway of the path of a bush of sleep
on the evening of the second way he was captured
he had neither eaten for slept for thirty six hours
the maritime tribunal condemned him for this crime to a prolongation of his term for three years which made eight years
in the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again be availed himself of it but could not accomplish his flight fully
he was missing at roll call
the cannon were fired and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction he resisted the valley guards who seized him
escape and rebellion
this case provided for by a special code was punished by an addition of five years two of them in the double chain
thirteen years
in the tenth year fix turn came round again he again profited by it he succeeded no better
three years for this fresh attempt
sixteen years
finally i think it was during his thirteenth year he made a last attempt and only succeeded in getting re taken at the end of four hours of absence
three years for those four hours
nineteen years
in october he was released he had entered therein for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread
room for a brief parenthesis
this is the second time during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny
claude the us had stolen a list jean valjean had stolen a loaf
english statistics prove the fact that fourth sets out of five in london have hunger for their immediate cause
jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering he emerged in passive
he had entered in despair he emerged gloomy
what had taken place in that soul
chapter vii the interior of despair let us try to say it
it is necessary that society should look at these things because it is itself which creates them
he was as we have said an ignorant man but he was not a fool
the light of nature was ignited in him
unhappiness which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this kind
beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in the cell in hardship beneath the burning sun of the galleys upon the plank bed of the convict he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated
he constituted himself the tribunal
he began by putting himself on trial
be recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished
he admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it that in any case it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work that it is not an unanswerable argument to say can one wait when one is hungry
that in the first place it is very rare for anyone to die of hunger literally and next that fortunately or unfortunately man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much both morally and physically without dying that it is therefore necessary to have patience that that would even have been better for those poor little children that it had been an act of madness for him a miserable unfortunate wretch to take society at large violently by the collar and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters in short that he was in the wrong
then he asked himself whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history
whether it was not a serious thing that he a laborer out of work that he an industrious man should have lacked bread
and whether the fault once committee and confessed the chastisement had not been ferocious and did proportioned
whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law in respect to the penalty than there has been in the part of the culprit in respect to his fault
whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale in the one which contains expiation
whether the overweight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime and did not result in reversing the situation of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression of converting the guilty man into the victim and the debtor into the creditor and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it
whether this penalty complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feebler a crime of society against the individuals crime which was being committed a fresh every day a crime which had lasted nineteen years
he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally on one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight and in the other case for its pitiless foresight and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess a default of work and an excess of punishment
whether it was not outrageous for society to treat this precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance and consequently the most deserving of consideration
these questions put and answered he judged society and condemned it
he condemned it to his hatred
he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account
he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not in truth unjust but that it most assuredly was iniquitous
jean valjean felt himself exasperated
and besides human society had done him nothing but harm he had never seen anything of its ave that angry face which it calls justice and which it shows to those whom it strikes
men had only touched him to bruise him
every contact with them had been a blow
g ever since his infancy since the days of his mother of his sister had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance
from suffering to suffering he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a car and that in this war he was the conquered
he had no other weapon than his hate
he resolved to whet it in the valleys and to hear it away with him when he departed
there was at toulon a school for the convicts kept by the ignorant in friars where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them
he was of the number who had a mind
he went to school at the age of forty and learned to read to write to cipher
he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hat w
in certain cases education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil
this is a sad thing to say after having judged society which had caused his unhappiness be judged providence which had made society and he condemned it also
thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery this soul mounted and at the same time fell
light entered it on one side and darkness on the other
jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil nature
he was still good when he arrived at the galleys
hey here condemned society and felt that he was becoming wicked be there condemned providence and was conscious that he was becoming impious
it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point
does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom
can the man created good by god be rendered wicked by man
can the soul be completely mad river by date and become evil rate being evil
can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of ad is proportionate unhappiness as the vertebral column beneath hollows vault
is there not in every human soul was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a first spark a divine element incorruptible in this world immortal in the other which good can develop can ignite and make to glow with splendor and which evil can never wholly extinguish
grave and obscure questions to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no and that without hesitation had he be held at toulon during the hours of repose which were for jean valjean hours off every this gloomy galley slaves rated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging serious silent and thoughtful a parish of the laws which regarded the man with wrath condemned by civilization and regarding heaven with severity
was this state of his soul which we have attempted to analyze as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us
did jean valjean distinctly perceive after their formation and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation all the elements of which his moral misery was composed
had thus rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he has by degrees mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had for so many years formed the inner horizon of his spirit
waste conscious of all that passed within him and of all that was working there
that is something which we do not presume to state it is something which we do not even believe
there was too much ignorance in jean valjean even after his misfortune to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there
at times he did not rightly know himself what he felt
jean valjean was in the shadows he suffered in the shadows he hated in the shadows one might have said that he hated in advance of himself
he dwelt habitually in this shadow feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer
only at intervals there suddenly came to him from without and from within an access of wrath a surcharge of suffering all god and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul and caused to appear abruptly all around him in front behind amid the gleams of a frightful light the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny
the flash passed the night closed in again and where waste
he no longer knew
the peculiarity of pains of this nature in which that which is pitiless that is to say that which is brutalizing predominates is to transform a man little by little by a sort of a tip of transfiguration into a wild beast sometimes into a ferocious beast
jean valjean would have renewed these attempts utterly useless and foolish as they were as often as the opportunity has presented itself without reflecting for an instant on the result nor on the experiences which he had already gone through
he escaped impetuously like the wolf who finds his cage open
instinct said to him flee
reason would have said remain
but in the presence of so violent a temptation reason vanished nothing remained but instinct
the beast alone acted
when he was recaptured the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild
one detail which we must not on it is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys
at work at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan jean valjean was worth four men
he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back and when the occasion demanded it be replaced that implement which is called a jackscrew and was formerly called orgueil price whence we may remark in passing is derived the name of the rue montorgueil near the halles fish market in paris
his comrades had nicknamed him mean the jackscrew
once when they were repairing the balcony of the town hall at toulon one of those admirable caryatid s of puget which support the balcony became loosened and was on the point of falling
jean valjean who was present supported the caryatid with his shoulder and gave the workmen time to arrive
his suppleness even exceeded his strength
certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined
it is the science of muscles
an entire system of mysterious static cis daily practised by prisoners men who are forever envious of the flies and birds
to climb a vertical surface and to find points of support where hardly a projection was visible was play to jean valjean
an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone he raised himself as if by magic to the third story
he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the valley prison
he spoke but little
he laughed not at all
an excessive emotion was required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon
to all appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible
he was absorbed in fact
athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence he was confused of conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him
if that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance be perceived with terror mingled with rage a sort of frightful accumulation of things collecting and mounting above him beyond the range of his vision laws prejudices men and deeds whose outlines escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization
he distinguished here and there in that swarming and formless mass now near him now afar off and on inaccessible tablelands somegroup some detail vividly illuminated here the valley sergeant and his cudgel there the gendarme and his sword yonder the mitred archbishop away at the top like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling
it seemed to him that these distant splendors far from dissipating his night rendered it more funereal and more black
all this laws prejudices deeds men things went and came above him over his head in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and one dog agility in its indifference
souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbo sat which no one any longer looks there proved of the law feel the whole weight of this human society so formidable for him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon their heads
in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature of his meditation
if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thoughts it would doubtless thunk that same thing which jean valjean thought
all these things realities full of spectres phantasm stories full of realities had eventually created for him a sort of inferior state which is almost indescribable
at times amid his conduct till he paused
he fell to thinking
his reason at one and the same time roper and more troubled than of yore rose in revolt
everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible
he said to himself it is a dream
he gazed at the valley sergeant standing a few paces from him the galley sergeant seemed a phantom to jim
all of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel
visible nature hardly existed for him
it would almost be true to say that there existed for jean valjean neither sun not find summer days nor radiant sign of fresh april dawns
i know not what vent hole daylight habitually illumined his soul
to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen years jean valjean the inoffensive tree pruned of favero plea the formidable convict of toulon had become capable thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action firstly of evil action which was rapid unpremeditated dashing entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone secondly of evil action which was serious grave consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish
his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse reasoning will perseverance
he had for moving causes his habitual death bitterness of soul a profound sense of indignities suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the just if there are any such
the point of departure like the point of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred which if it be not arrested in its development by some providential incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society then the hatred of the human race then the hatred of creation and which majid sets itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to some living being no matter whom
from year toys art his soul have died away slowly but with fatal sureness
when the heart is fry the eye is dry
on his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had a great war
chapter viii billows and shadows a man overboard
what matters it
the vessel does not halt
the wind blows
that sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue
it passes on
the man disappears then reappears he plunged he rises again to the surface he calls he stretches out his arms he is not heard
the vessel trembling under the hurricane is wholly absorbed in its own workings the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves
he gives bent to desperate cries from out of the depths
what a spectre is that retreating sail
he gazed and gazes at it frantically
it retreats it grows do not diminished in size
he was there but just now he was one of the crew he went and came along the deck with the rest he had his part of breath and of sunlight he was a living man
now what has taken place
he has slipped he has fallen all is at an end
he is in the the mendous sea
underfoot he has nothing but what fires and crumbles
the bill last organ slashed by the wind encompass him hideously the tos songs of the abyss bear him away all the tongues of water wash over his head a populace of waves spots upon him confused openings half devour him every time that he sinks he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night frightful and unknown vegetations seize him knot about his feet draw him to them he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss that he forms part of the foam the waves toss him from one to another he drinks in the bitterness the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously to drown him the enormity plays with his agony
it seems as though all that water de rebate
nevertheless he struggles
he tries to defend himself he tries to sustain himself he makes an effort he swims
he his petty strength all exhausted instantly combats the inexhaustible
where the nis the ship
yonder
barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon
the wind blows in gusts all the foam overwhelm shih
he raises his eyes and he holds only the livid ness of the clouds
he witnessed a mid his death pangs the immense madness of the sea
he is tortured by this madness he heard noises strange to man which seem to come from beyond the limits of the earth and from one knows not what frightful region het ons
there are birds in the clouds just as there are angels above human distresses but what can they do for him
they sing and fly and float and hehe rattles in the death agony
he feels himself buried in those two infinities the ocean and the sky at one and the same time the one is a tomb the other is a shroud
night descend she has been swimming for hours his strength is exhausted that ship that distant thing in which there were men had vanished he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf he sinks he stiffens himself he twists himself he feels under him the monstrous billows of the invisible bra hours
there are no more men
where is god
he shouts
help
help
he still a hours in
nothing on the horizon nothing in heaven
he implored the expanse the waves the seaweed the reef they are deaf
tv beseeches the tempest the imperturbable tempest obeys only the infinite
around him darkness for solitude the stormy and non sentient tumult the undefined curling of those wild waters
in him horror and fatigue
beneath him the depths
not a point of support
he thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow
the bottomless cold paralyzes him
his hands contract convulsively they close and grasp nothingness
winds clouds whirlwinds gusts useless state
what is to be done
the desperate man gives up he is weary he chooses the alternative of death he resists not he lets himself to be abandons his trip and then he tosses forevermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulfment
oh implacable march of human societies
oh losses of men and of souls on the web
ocean into which falls all that the law lets slip
disastrous absence of help
ph moral death
the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws doing their condemned
the sea is the immensity of wretchedness
the soul going downstream in this gulf may become a corpse
who shall resuscitate in
chapter ix new troubles when the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys when jean valjean heard in his ear the strange words thou art free
the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented a day of vivid light a way of the true light of the living suddenly penetrated within him
but it was not long before this day paper
jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty
he had believed in a new life
he very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided
and this was encompassed with much bitterness
he had calculated that his earnings during his sojourn in the ballet sought to amount to a hundred and seventy one france
it is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of sundays and festival days during nineteen years which entailed a simi nition of about eighty france
at all events his board had been re dj cds by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine france fifteen sous which had been counted out to him on his departure
he had understood nothing of this and had thought himself wronged
let us say the word ribbed
on the day following his liberation he saw at grasse in front of an orange flower distillery some men engaged in unloading bales
he offered his services
business was pressing they were accepted
he set to work
he was intelligent robust adroit he did his best the master seemed pleased
while he was at work a gendarme passed observed him and demanded his papers
it was necessary to show him the yellow passport
that done jean valjean resumed his labor
a little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation he had been told thirty sous
when evening arrived as he was forced to set out again on the following day be presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid
the owner did not utter a word but handed him fifteen sous
he objected
he was told that is enough for the e
he persisted
the master looked him straight between the eyes and said to him beware of the prison
there again be considered that he had been robbed
society the state by diminishing his board had robbed him wholesale
now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail
liberation is not deliverance
one gets free from the galleys but not from the sentence
that is what happened to him at grasse
we have seen in what manner he was received at echapters the man aroused as the cathedral clock struck two in the morning jean valjean awoke
what woke him was that his bed was too good
it was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed and although he had not undressed the sensation was too novel not to disturb his climbers
he had slept more than four hours
his fatigue had passed away
he was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose
he opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him then he closed them again with the intention of going to sleep once more
when many varied sensations have agitated the day when various matters preoccupy the mind one falls asleep once but not a second time
sleep comes more easily than it returns
this is what happened to jean valjean
he could not get to sleep again and he fell to thinking
there was a sort of dark confusion in his brain
his memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell hell and mingled confusedly losing their proper forms becoming did proportionately large then suddenly disappearing as in a muddy and perturbed pool
many thoughts occurred to him but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself a fresh and which drove away all others
we will mention this thought at once he had observed the six sets of silver world and spoons and the ladle which madame magloire had placed on the table
those six sets of silver haunted him
they were there
a few paces distant
just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was the old servant woman had been in the act of placing them on a little cupboard near the head of the new
he had taken careful note of this cupboard
on the right as you entered from the dining room
they were solid
and old silver
from the law leone could get at least two hundred francs
double what he had earned in nineteen years
it is true that he would have earned more of the administration had not robbed him
his mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle
he opened his eyes again drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture stretched out his arm and dept of his knapsack which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed and placed his feet on the floor and thus found himself almost without knowing it seated on his bed
he remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude which would have been suggestive of something sinister for anyone who had seen him thus in the dark the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping
all of a sudden he stooped down removed his shoes and placed them softly on them at beside the bed then he resumed his thought ftp attitude and became motionless once more
throughout this hideous meditation the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain entered withdrew reentered and in a man net oppressed him and then he thought also without knowing why and with the mechanical persistence of revert of a convict games brevet whom he had known in the valleys and whose tri users had been upheld by a single suspended of knitted cotton
the checkered pattern of that suspended recurred incessantly to his mind
he remained in this situation and would have so remained in definitely even until daybreak had not the clock struck one the half or quarter hour
it seemed to him that that stroke said to him come on
he rose to his feet hesitated still another moment and listened all was quiet on the house then he walked straight ahead with short steps to the window of which he caught a glimpse
the night was not very dark there was a full moon across which courses large clouds driven by the wind
this created outdoors alternate shadow and gleams of light eclipses then bright openings of the clouds and indoors a sort of twilight
this twilight sufficient to enable a person to see his way intermittent on account of the clouds resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air hole in a cellar before which the passers by come and go
on arriving at the window jean valjean examined it
it had not saying it opened in the garden and was fastened according to the fashion of the country only by a small pin
he opened it but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly he closed it again immediately
be scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looms
the garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall easy to climb
far away at the extremity he perceived tops of trees spaced at regular intervals which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue of page planted with trees
having taken this survey he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind strode to his also be grasped his knapsack opened it fumbled in it pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed put his shoes into one of his pockets shut the whole thing up again threw the knapsack on his shoulders put in his cap drew the visor down over his eyes felt for his cudgel went and placed it in the angle of the window then returned to the bed and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there
it resembled a short bar of iron pointed like spike at one end
it would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed
perhaps it was a lever possibly it was a club
he took the candlestick in his right hand holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room occupied by the bishop as we already know
on arriving at this door he found it a jar
the bishop had not closed it
chapter xi what he does jean valjean listened
not a sound
he gave the doors push
he pushed it gently with the top of his finger lightly with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering
the door yielded to this pressure and made an imperceptible and silent movement which enlarged the opening a little
he waited a moment then gave the door a second and an older push
it continued to yield in silence
the opening was now large enough to allow him to pass
but near the door there stood a little table which formed an embarrassing angle with it and barred the entrance
jean valjean recognized the difficulty
it was necessary at any cost to enlarge the aperture still further
he decided on his course of action and gave the door a third push more energetic than the two preceding
this time a badly oiled hinge suddenly emitted amid the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry
jean valjean shuddered
the guise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of judgment
in the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated and had suddenly assumed a terrible life and that it was backing like a dog to arouse everyone and warm and to wake those who were asleep
he halted shuddering bewildered and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels
he heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern
it seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated him he should not have disturbed the entire household like the shock of an earthquake the door pushed by him had taken the alarm and had shouted the old man would rise at once the two old women would shriek our people would come to their assistance in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar and the gendarmerie on hand
for a moment he thought himself list
he remained where he was petrified like the statue of salt not daring to make a movement
several minutes elapsed
the door had fallen wide open
he ventured to peep into the next room
nothing had stirred there
he lent a near
nothing was moving on the mouse
the noise made by the rush things had not awakened anyone
this first danger was last but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him
nevertheless he did not retreat
even when he had thought himself lost he had not drawn back
his only thought now was to finish as soon as possible
he took a step and entered the room
this room was in a state of perfect calm
here and there vague and confused forms were distinguish able which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table open folios volumes piled upon a stool an armchair heaped with clothing apr ie dieu and which at that hour were only shadowy corners and whitish spots
jean valjean advanced with precaution taking care not to knock against the furniture
he could hear at the extremity of the room the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping bishop
he suddenly came to a halt
he was near the bed
he had arrived there sooner than he had thought for
nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriateness as though she desired to make us reflect
for the last half hour a large cloud had covered the heavens
he was sleeping peaceful py
he lay in his bed almost completely dressed on account of the cold of the basses alps in a garment of brown wool which covered his arms to the wrists
his head was thrown back on the pillow in the careless attitude of repose his hand adorned with the pastoral ring and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions was hanging over the edge of the bed
his whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction of hope and of felicity
it was more than a smile and almost a radiance
he bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible
the soul of the just contemplates in sleep a mysterious heaven
a reflection of that heaven rested on the bishop
it was at the same time a luminous transparency for that heaven was within him
that heaven was his conscience
illustration the fall b the fall at the moment when the day of moonlight superposed itself so to speak up on that inward radiance the sleeping bishop seemed as in a glory
it remained however gentle and veiled in an ineffable half light
that moon in the sky that slumbering nature that garden without aquifer that house which was so calm them out the moment the silence added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair those closed eyes that face in which all was hope and all was confidence that head of an old man and that slumber of an infant
there was something almost divine in this man who was thus august without being himself aware of it
jean valjean was in the shadow and stood motionless with his iron candle stick in his hand frightened by this luminous old man
never had he beheld anything like this
this confidence terrified him
the moral world has no grander spectacle than this a troubled and uneasy conscience which has arrived on the brink of an evil action contemplating the slumber of the just
that slumber in that isolation and with a neighbor like himself had about it something sublime of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious
no one could have told what was passing within him not even himself
in order to attempt to form abodes of it it is necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle
even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty
it was a sort of haggard astonishment
he gazed at it and that was all
but what was his thought
it would have been impossible to divine it
what was evident was that he was touched and astounded
but what was the nature of this emotion
his eye never quitted the old man
the only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision
he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand
at the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow and he took off his cap then his arm fell back with the same deliberation and jean valjean fell to meditating once more his cap in his left hand his club in his right hand his hair bristling all over his savage head
the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze
the gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the chimney piece which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them with a benediction for one and pardon for the other
suddenly jean valjean replaced his cap on his brow then stepped rapidly past the bed without glancing at the bishop straight to the cupboard which he saw near the head he raised his iron candle stick as though to force the lock the key was there he opened it the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware he seized it traverses the chamber with long strides without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise gained the door reentered the oratory opened the window seized his cudgel bestrode the windowsill of the ground floor put the silver into his knapsack threw away the basket crossed the garden leaped over the wall like a tiger and flex
chapter xii the bishop works the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden
madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation
monseigneur monseigneur
she exclaimed does your grace know where the basket of silver is
yes replied the bishop
jesus the lord be blessed
she resumed i did not know what had become of it
the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower bed
he presented it to madame magloire
here it is
sell
said she
nothing in it
and the silver
at returned the bishop so it is the silver which troubles you
great good god
it is stolen
that man who was here last night has stolen it
in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman madame magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and returned to the bishop
the bishop had just bent down and was sitting as he examined a plant of cochlearia was full line which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed
monseigneur the man is gone
the silver has been stolen
as she uttered this exclamation her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible
the coping of the wall had been torn away
stay
yonder is the way he went
he jumped over into coches i leyland
at the atom imation
he has stolen our silver
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire and in the first place was that silver ours
madame magloire was speechless
another silence ensued then the bishop went on madame magloire i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully
it belonged to the poor
who was that man
a poor man evidently
spas
jesus
returned madame magloire
it makes no difference to us
but it is for the sake of monseigneur
what is monseigneur to eat with now
the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement
at some
are there no such things as pewter forms and spoons
madame magloire shrugged her shoulders
pewter has an odor
iron forms and spoons then
madame magloire made an expressive grimace
iron has a taste
very well said the bishop wooden ones then
a few moments later he was breakfast inn at the very table at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening
as he ate his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gayly to his sister who said nothing and to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath that one really does not need either form of spoon even of wood in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk
a pretty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and came to take in a man like that
and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal
at mon dieu
it makes one shudder to think of it
as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came a knock at the door
come in said the bishop
the door opened
a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold
three men were holding a fourth man by the dollar
the three men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean
a brigadier of gendarmes who seemed to be in command of the group was standing near the door
he entered and advanced to the bishop making a military salute
monseigneur said he
at this word jean valjean who was rejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of stupefaction
monseigneur
he murmured
so he is not the site
silence
said the gendarme
he is monseigneur the bishop
in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great are permitted
ah
here you are
he exclaimed looking at jean valjean
i am glad to see you
well but how is this
i have you the candlesticks too which are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs
why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons
jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of
monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said is true then
we came across him
he was walking like a man who is running away
we stopped him to look into the matter
he had this silver and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night
i see how the matter stands
and you have brought him back here
it is a mistake
in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go
certainly replied the bishop
the gendarmes released jean valjean who recoiled
is it true that i am to be released
he said in an almost in art icy late voice and as though he were talking in his sleep
yes thou art released dost thou not understand
said one of the gendarmes
my friend resumed the bishop before you go here are your candlesticks
take them
he stepped to the chimney piece took the two silver candlesticks and brought them to jean valjean
the two women looked on without uttering a word without a gesture without a look which could disconcert the bishop
jean valjean was trembling in every limb
he took the two candlesticks mechanically and with a bewildered air
now said the bishop go in peace
by the way when you return my friend it is not necessary to pass through the garden
you can always enter and depart through the street door
it is never fastened with anything but a patch either by day or by night
then turning to the gendarmes you may retire gentleman
the gendarmes retired
jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting
the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice do not forget never forget that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man
jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless
the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered then
here ahmed with solemnity jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to evil but to good
it is your soul that i buy from you i withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and i give it to god
chapter xiii little gervais jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it
he set out at a very tasty pace through the fields taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps
he wandered thus the whole morning with out having eaten anything and without feeling hungry
he was the prey of a throng of novel sensations
he was conscious of a sort of rage he did not know against whom it was directed
he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated
there came over him at moments a stranger motion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life
this state of mind fatigued jim
he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him
he asked himself what would replace this
at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less
although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few late flowers in the hedgerows here and there whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood
these memories were almost intolerable to him it was so long since that has recurred to him
unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long
as the sun declined to its setting casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a busy upon a large ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted
there was nothing on the horizon except the alps
not even the spire of a distant village
jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from da path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush
in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not a little to render his tags terrifying to anyone who might have encountered him a joyous sound became audible
he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age coming up the path and singing his hurdy gurdy on his hip and his marmot box on his back
one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers
without stopping his song the law halted in his march from time to time and played at knuckle bones with some coins which he had in his hand his whole fortune probably
among this money there was one for the ou piece
the child halted beside the bush without perceiving jean valjean and tossed up his handful of sous which up to that time he had caught with a good deal of adroitness on the back of his hand
this time the forty couple ce escaped him and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached jean valjean
jean valjean set his foot upon it
in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him
he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the jag
the spot was absolutely solitary
as far as the eye could see there was not a person in the plain or on the path
the only sound was the tiny feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the heavens at an immense height
the child was standing with his back to the sun which cast threads of gold in his hair and em purples with its blood red gleam the savage face of jean valjean
sir said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence my money
what is your name
said jean valjean
little gervais air
go away said jean valjean
sir resumed the child give me back my money
jean valjean dropped his head and made no reply
the child began again my money air
my piece of money
cried the child my white piece
my silver
it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him
the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him
at the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron shod shoe which rested on his treasure
i want my piece of money
my piece of forty sous
the child welt
jean valjean raised his head
he still remained seated
his eyes arts troubled
is it replied the child
little gervais
i
give me back by forty sous if you please
take your foot away sir if you please
then irritated though he was so small and becoming almost menacing come now will you take your foot away
x y
said jean valjean and rising abruptly to his feet his foot still resting on the silver piece he added will you take yourself off
the frightened child looked at him then began to tremble from head to foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry
nevertheless lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own revert
at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared
the sun had set
the shadows were descending around jean valjean
he had eaten nothing all day it is probable that he was feverish
the breath headed his chest at long and irregular intervals
his gaze fixed ten of twelve paces in front of him seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass
all at once he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening
he settled his cap more firmly on his brow sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse advanced a step and shipped to pick up his cudgel
at that moment he caught sight of the forty so i piece which his foot had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles
it was as though he has received a galvanic stock
what is this
he muttered between his teeth
here cooled three paces then halted without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittery if there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him
at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin seized it and straightened himself up again and began to gazes far off over the plain at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge
he saw nothing
night was falling the plain was cold and vague great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight
he said am
and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared
after about thirty pace she paused looked about him and saw nothing
then he shouted with all his might little gervais
little gervais
he paused and waited
there was no reply
the landscape was gloomy and deserted
he was encompassed by space
there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost and a silence which engulfed his voice
an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life
the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury
p he would have said that they were threatening and pursuing someone
he set out on his march again then he began to humans from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear little gervais
little gervais
assuredly of the child had heard him he would have been alarmed and would have taken goods are not to show himself
but the child was no doubt already far away
he encountered a priest on horseback
he stepped up to him and said monsieur le cure have you seen a child pass
no said the priest
one named little gervais
i have seen holme
he drew two five franc pieces from his money bag and handed them to the priest
monsieur le cure this is for your poor people
monsieur le sure he was a little mad about ten years old with a marmot i think and a hurdy gurdy
one of those savoyards you know
i have not seen him
little gervais
there are no villages here
can you tell me
if he is like what you say my friend he is a little stranger
such persons pass through these parts
we know nothing of the k
jean valjean seized two more coins office france each with violence and gave them to the priest
for your poor he said
i am a thief
the priest put spurs to his horse and died in haste much alarmed
jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first taken
in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance gazing calling shouting but he met no one
two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being declining or crouching down it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth
at length at a spot where these paths intersected each other he stopped
the moon had risen
he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time little gervais
little gervais
little gervais
his shout died away in the most without even awakening an echo
he murmured yet once more little gervais
but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice
it was his last effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees and he cried i am a wretch
then his heart burst and he began to cry
it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years
he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within jim
he hardened himself against the angel is a cgi on and the gentle words of the old man
you have promised me to become an honest man
i buy your soul
i take it away from the spirit of perversity i give it to the gold box
this recurred to his mind unceasingly
to this celestial kindness he opposed pride which is the fortress of evil within us
he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet that his obduracy was finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years and which pleased him that this time it was necessary to conqueror to be conquered and that a struggle a colossal and final struggle had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man
in the presence of these lights he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated
as he walked this with haggard eyes did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure are
did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn of importune the spirit at certain moments of life
did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny that there no longer remained a middle course for him that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behooves him now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or call lower than the convict that if he wished to become good he must become an angel that if he wished to remain evil he must become a monster
here again some questions must be put which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought in a confused way
misfortune certainly as we have said does form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated
if these ideas occurred to him he but caught glimpses of rather than saw them and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion
in emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop had hurt his son las too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark
the future life the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with tremors and anxiety
he no longer knew where he really was
like an owl who should suddenly see the sunrise the convict had been dazzled and blinded as it were by virtue
that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no longer the same man that everything about him was changed that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him
in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed him of his forty sous
why
he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of impulse a result of what is called in statics acquired force
it was that and it was also perhaps even less than that
let us say it simply it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast who by habit and instinct had simply placed his foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling a kid so many novel and hitherto unheard of thoughts be setting it
when intelligence be awakened and be held that action of the brute jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror
illustration awakened b awakened it was because strange phenomenon and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself in stealing the money from that child he had done a thing on which he was no longer capable
however that maybe this last evil action had a decisive effect on him it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind and dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and on the other the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other
first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all bewildered like one who seeks to save himself he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him then when he recognized the fact that this was impossible he halted in despair
at the moment when he exclaimed i am a wretch
he had just perceived what he was and he was already separated from himself to such a degree that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom and as if he had there before him in flesh and blood the hideous valley convict jean valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects
excess of un happiness had as we have remarked made him in some sort a visionary
this then was in the nature of a vision
he actually saw that jean valjean that sinister face before him
he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was and he was horrified by him
his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which revert is so profound that it absorbs reality
thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and at the same time athwart this hallucination he perceived in a mysterious depths sort of light which he at first took for a torch
on scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop
his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before it the bishop and jean valjean
nothing less than the first was required to soften the second
by one of those singular effects which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies in proportion as his revert continued as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow less and vanish
after a certain time he was no longer anything more than we have
all at once he disappeared
the bishop alone remained be filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance
jean valjean wept for a long time
he wept burning year she sobbed with more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child
as he wept day light penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an extraordinary lights light at once ravishing and terrible
he examined his life and it seemed horrible to him his soul and it seemed frightful to him
in the meantime a gentle light tested over this life and this soul
it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise
how many hours dishes depth us
what did he do after he had wept
whither did he go
no one ever knew

there had already been more than one episode in their romance though hardly begun and the lover who had borne the name of a dolphin the first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second and gustave in the third
poverty and coquetry are two fatal counsellors ones colds and the other flatters and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in the idea reach on its own side
these badly guarded would listen
hence the falls which they accomplish and the stones which are thrown at them
they are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible
alas
what if the jungfrau were hungry
favourite having been in england was admired by dahlia and ze phone
she had had an establishment of her own very early in life
her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics a brutal man and a braggart who went out to give lessons in spite of his age
the result has been favourite
she met her father from time to time and he vowed to her
one morning an old woman with the air of a devotee had entered her apartments and had said to her you do not know me make noise lle
no
i am your mother
then the old woman opened the sideboard and ate and frank had a mattress which she owned broughton and installed herself
it was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn dahlia to list plied to others perhaps to idleness
how could shemale such nails work
she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands
as fotze phones he had conquered faneuil by her roguish and caressing little way of saying yes sir
the young men were comrades the young girls were friends
such lives are always accompanied by such friendships
good news and philosophy are two distinct things the proof of this is that after making all due allowances for these little irregular households favourites ephone and dahlia were philosophical young women who let anyone was a good girl
good
someone will exclaim and tho i oh yes
solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom
we will confine ourselves to saying that the love of fantine was a first love a sole love a faithful life
steal one of all the four was not called though a single one of them
fantine was one of those beings who blossom so to speak from the dregs of the people
though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown
she was born atm
shrm
of what parents
who can say
she had never known father or mother
she was called bantine
why fantine
she had never borne any other name
at the epoch other birth the dieectory still existed
she had no family names he had no family no baptismal name the church no longer existed
she bore the name which pleased the first random passerby who had encountered her when a very small child running bare legged in the street
she received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained
she was called little fantine
no one knew more than that
this human creature had entered life in just this way
at the age often fantine quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood
at fifteen she came to paris to seek her fortune
fantine was beautiful and remained pure as long as she could
she was a lovely blonde with fine teeth
she had good and pearls for her dowry but her gold was on her head and her pearls were in her mouth
she worked for her living then still for the sake of her living for the heart also has its hunger she loved
she loved t bloom yes
an amour for him passion for her
the streets of the latin quarter filled with throngs of students and g rosettes saw the beginning of their dream
fantine had long evaded tho pongee in the mazes of the bill of the pantheon where so many adventurers twine and igraine but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again
there is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking
in short the eclogue took place
bla chevelle list plier and faneuil formed a sort of group of which tho i oh yes was the head
it was he who possessed the wit
t holon yes was the antique old student he was rich he had an income of four thousand francs four thousand francs
a splendid scandal on mount sainte genevieve
full oh yes was a fast man of thirty and badly preserved
he was wrinkled and toothless and he had the beginning of a bald spot or which he himself said with sadness the skull at thirty the knee at forty
his digestion was mediocre and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye
but in proportion as his youth disappeared gayety was kindled be replaced his teeth with buffoon fries his hair with mirth his health with iron this weeping the laughed incessantly
he was dilapidated but still in flower
his youth which was packing up for departure long before its time feat a retreat in good order bursting with laughter and no one saw anything but fire
he had had a piece rejected at the vaudeville
he made a few verses now and then
in addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree which is a vast force in the eyes of the weak
being thus ironical and bald he was the leader
iron is an english word
is it possible that irony is derived from it
one day tho i oh yes took the three others aside with the gesture of an oracle and said to the meantime dahlias ephone and favourite have been teasing us for nearly a year to give them a surprise
we have promised them solemnly that we would
pressure on both sides
the moment has arrived it seems to me let us discuss the question
thereupon thilo my ds lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out upon the four mouths simultaneously and bla chevelle exclaimed that is an idea
a smoky tap room presented itself they entered and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow
the result of these shares was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on the following sunday the four young men inviting the four young girls
the suburbs of paris are no longer the same the physiognomy of what may be called circum parisian life has changed completely in the last half century where there was the cuckoo there is the railway car where there was a tender boat there is now the steamboat people speak of fecamp nowadays as they spoke of saint cloud in those days
the paris it is a city which has france for its outskirts
the four couples conscientiously went through with all the country follies possible at that time
the vacation was beginning and it was a warm bright summer day
on the preceding day favourite the only one who knew how to write had written the following to tmpl oh yes in the name of the four it is a good hour to emerge from happiness
then they went to saint cloud by the coach looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed this must be very beautiful when there is water
the young girls rustled and chatted like warblers escaped from their cage
it was a perfect delirium
from time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men
math final intoxication of life
adorable years
the wings of the dragonfly quiver
oh whoever you may be so you not remember
have you rambles through the brushwood holding aside the branches on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you
have you slid laughing down a slope all wet with rain with a beloved woman holding your hand and crying at my new boots
what a state they are in
let us say at once that that merry obstacles shower was lacking in the case of this good humored party although favourite had said as they set out with a magisterial and maternal to be the slugs are crawling in the paths a sign of rain children
all four were madly pretty
a good old classic post them famous a good fellow who had an eleonore m
sep time and dahlia whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together and completed each other never left each other more from an instinct of coquetry than from friendship and clinging to each other they assumed english poses the first keepsakes had just made their appearance melancholy was dawning for women as later on byron i am dawned for men and the hair of the tender sex began to stoop so is fully
sep time and dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls
list plier and faneuil who were engaged in discussing their professors explained to fantine the difference that existed between m
delvin court and m
blondeau
t holon yes followed dominating the group
he was very baugh to be felt the force of government in him there was dictation in his joviality his principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant leg pattern of man keen with straps of braided copper wire he carried a stout rattan worth two hundred francs in his hand and as he treated himself to everything a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth
nothing was sacred to him he smoked
that thilk my es is astounding
said the others with generation
what trousers
what energy
as for fantine she was a joy to behold
her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from god laughter
she preferred to carry her little hat of sewer straw with its long white strings other hand rather than on her head
hdd thick blond hair which was inclined to wave and which easily uncoiled and which it was necessary to fasten up incessantly seemed made for the flight of galatea under the willows
her rosy lips babbled enchantingly
the corners of her mouth voluptuously turned up as in the antique mask site for one had an air of encouraging the audacious but her long shadowy lashes dropped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as thou but i call a halt
there was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress
she wore a town of mauve bare be little reddish brown huskins whose ribbons traced and on her fine white open worked stockings and that sort of muslim spencer a marseilles invention whose names and soya corruption of the words quinze a lot pronounced after the fashion of the same fiere signifies fine weather heat and midday
the most ingenious is at times the wisest
this does happen
brilliant of face delicate of profile with eyes of a deep blue heavy kids feet arched and small wrists and ankles admirably formed a white skin which here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to base enjoy a cheek that was young and fresh the robust throat of the juno of aegina a strong and supple nape of the neck shoulders modelled as though my skis you with a voluptuous simple in the middle visible through the muslims gayety cooled by dreaminess sculptural and exquisite such was fantine and beneath these feminine adornments and these ribbons one could divine a statue and in that statues soul
fantine was beautiful without being too conscious of it
those rare dreamers mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection would have caught a glimpse of this little working woman through the transparency of her parisian grace of the ancient sacred euphony
this daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred
she was beautiful in the two ways style and rhythm
style is the form of the ideal rhythm is its movement
we have said that fantine was not she was also modesty
to an observer who studied her attentively that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age the season and her love affair was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty
she remained a little astonished
this chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates psyche from venus
fantine had the long white fine fingers of the vestal virgins host its the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pin
although she would have refused nothing to tho i oh yes as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see her face in repose was supremely virginal a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there and meditation succeed to cheerful news without any transition state
this sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess
her brow her nose her chin presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion and from which harmony of countenance results in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip she had that imperceptible and charming fold a mysterious sign of chastity which makes barbero us see all in love with a diana found in the treasures of ixonia
love is a fault zone it
dan time was innocence floating high over fault
chapter iv tho limted is so merry that he sings a spanish ditty that day was composed of dawn from one end to the other
all nature seemed to be having a holiday and to be laughing
the flower beds of saint cloud perfumed the air the breath of these in trust led the leaves vaguely the branches gesticulated in the wind bees pillaged the jasmines a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow the clover and the sterile oats in the august park of the king of france there was a lack of vagabonds the birds
the four merry couples mingled with the sun the fields the flowers the trees were resplendent
and in this community of paradise talking singing running dancing chasing butterflies plucking convolvulus setting their pink open work stockings in the tall grass fresh wild without malice all received to some extent the kisses of all with the exception of fantine who was hedged about with that vague resistance others composed of dreaminess and wildness and who was in love
you always have a queer look about you said favourite toner
such things are joys
these passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature and make a caress and light spring forth from everything
there was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love in that eternal hedge school of lovers which is forever beginning a new and which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars
hence the popular ity of spring among thinkers
the patrician and the knife grinder the duke and the peer the limb of the law the courtiers and townspeople as they used to say in olden times all are subjects of this fairy
they laugh and hunt and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis what a transfiguration effected by love
and the little cries the pursuits through the grass the exists embraced of the fly those jargons which are melodies those adoration z which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable those cherries torn from one mouth by another all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories
beautiful women waste themselves sweetly
they think that this will never come to amend
philosopher sports painters observe these ecstasies and know not what to make of it so greatly are they dazzled by it
the departure for cythera
it was an odd and charming shrub with a long stem whose numerous branches bristling and leafless and as fine as threads were covered with a million tony white rosettes this gave the shrub the air of ahead of hair studded with flowers
there was always an admiring crowd about it
after viewing the shrub tmpl oh yes exclaimed i offer you asses
and having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses they returned by way off andrew and i say
ati day an incident occurred
the truly national park at that time owned by bout ruin the contractor happened to be wide open
they passed the gates visited the manikin anchorite in his grotto tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of the caret metamorphosed into a priapus

there is no such thing as fatigue on sunday said favourite on sunday fatigue does not work
from time to time favourite exclaimed and the surprise
i claim the surprise
patience replied tho lim yes
a large but only room with an alcove and a bed at the end they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the sunday crowd two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms the quay and the river a magnificent august sunlight lightly touching the pages two tables upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets mingled with the hats of men and women at the other the four couples seated found a merry confusion of platters dishes glasses and bottles jugs of beer mingled with flasks of wine very little order on the table some disorder beneath it they made beneath the table a house a clatter of the feet that was abominable says moliere
the sun was setting their appetites were satisfied
the champs elysees filled with sunshine and with people were nothing but light and dust the two things of which glory is composed
the horses of marly those neighing marbles were prancing in a cloud of gold
carriages were going and coming
a squadron of magnificent bodyguards with their clarion sat their head were descending the avenue de neuilly the white flag showing faintly body in the setting sun floated over the dome of the tuileries
the place de la concorde which had become the place louis xv
once more was choked with happy promenade r s
many wore the silver fleur de lis suspended from the white date red ribbon which had not yet wholly disappeared from button holes in the year
here and there choruses of little girls three to the winds amid the passersby who formed into circles and applauded the then celebrated bourbon air which was destined to strike the hundred days with lightning and which had for its refrain rendez nous notre per eden and rendez nous not depere
give us back our father from ghent give us back our father
groups of dwellers in the suburbs in sunday array sometimes even decorated with the fleur de lys like the bourgeois scattered over the large square and the marigny square were playing strings and revolving on the wooden horse dot mega were engaged in drinking some journeyman printers had on paper caps their laughter was audible
everything was radiant
it was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security it was the epoch when a special and private report of chief of police angeles to the king on the subject of the suburbs of paris terminated with these lines taking all things into consideration sure there is nothing to be feared from these people
they are as heedless and as indolent assays
the populace is restless in the provinces it is not in paris
these are very pretty men site
it would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers
there is nothing to be feared in the part of the populace of paris the capital
it is remarkable that the statute of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the revolution
it is not dangerous
in short it is an amiable rabble
prefects of the police do not deem it possible that a cat can transform itself into a lion that does happen however and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of paris
moreover the cat so despised by count angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old
in their eyes it was liberty incarnate and as though to serve as pendant to the minerva altera of the piraeus there stood on the public square in corinth the colossal bronze figure of a cat
the ingenious police of the restoration be held the populace of paris in too rose colored a light it is not so much of an amiable rabble as it is thought
the parisian is to the frenchman what the athenian was to the greek no one sleeps more soundly than he no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he no one can better assume the aid of forgetfulness let him not be trusted nevertheless he is ready for any sort of cool deed but when there is glory at the end of it he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury
give him a like he will produce the th of august give him a gun you will have austerlitz
is it a question of country he enlists is it a question of liberty he tears up the pavements
beware
his hair filled with wrath is epic his blouse drapes itself like the folds of a chlamys
take care
he will make of the first guerre net at which comes to hanecak done for us
when the hour strikes this man of the faubourg s will grow in stature this little man will arise and his gaze will be terrible and his breath will become a tempest and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind god is arrange the folds of the alps
it is thanks to the suburban man of paris that the revolution mixed with arms conquers europe
he sings it is his delight
proportion his song to his nature and you will see
as long as he has for refrain nothing but la car mag mile he only overthrows louis xvi
make him sing the marseillaise and he will free the world
the dinner as we have said was drawing to its close
chapter via chapter in which they adore each other chat at table the chat of love it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other the chat of love is a cloud the chat at table is smoke
faneuil and dahlia were humming
trol oh yes was drinking
sep mine was laughing fan time smiling list plier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at saint cloud
favourite based tenderly at bla chevelle and said bla chevelle i adore you
this called forth a question from bla chevelle what would you do favourite if i were to cease to love you
i
cried favourite
ah
do not say that even in jest
if you were to cease to love me i would spring after you i would scratch you i should tend you i would throw you into the water i would have you arrested
bla chevelle smiled with the voluptuous self conceit of a man who is tickles in his self love
favourite resumed yes i would scream to the police
ah
i should not restrain myself not at all
rabble
bla chevelle threw himself back in his chair in an ecstasy and closed both eyes proudly
dahlia as she ate said in a low voice to favourite amid the uproar so you really idolize him deeply that bla chevelle of yours
i
i detest him replied favourite in the same time seizing her fork again
he is avaricious
i love the little fellow opposite me in my house
he is very nice that young man do you know him
one can see that he is an actor by profession
i love actors
mon dieu
my peace of mind is gone

so that he can be heard downstairs
he is the son of a former precentor of saint jacques duh auto as
ah
he is very nice
ah

i am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow
nevermind i tell bla chevelle that i adore him to wilke
hey

favourite paused and then went on i am sad you see dahlia
it has done nothing but rain all summer the wind irritates me the wind does not abate
box chevelle is very stingy there are hardly any green peas in the market one does not know what to eat
i have the spleen as the english say butter is spread

this pin which has fallen from the skies must not be received with too much stupor

ladies take the advice of a friend make a mistake in your neighbor if you see fit
the property of love is to err
a love affair is not made to crouch down and brutalize itself like an english serving maid who has callouses on her knees from scrubbing

as for favourite o nymphs and muses
one day when bla chevelle was crossing the gutter in the rue guerin boisseau her spied a beautiful girl with white stockings well drawn up which displayed her legs
this prologue pleased him and bla chevelle fell in love
the one he loved was favourite

a flower should smell sweet and woman should have wit
i say nothing of fantine she is a dreamer amusing thoughtful pensive person she is a phantom possessed of the form of a nymph and the modesty of a nun who has strayed into the life of an rosette but who takes refuge in illusions and who sings and prays and gazes into the azure without very well knowing what she sees or what she is doing and who with her eyes fixed in heaven wanders in a garden where there are more birds than are in existence
if anyone know thus it holon yes i am all illusion but she does not even hear me that blond hair of chimeras

at the same moment bla chevelle supported by list plier and faneuil struck up to a plaintive aid one of those studio songs composed of the first words which come to hand rhymes richly and not a tall as destitute of sense as the gesture of the tree and the sound of the wind which have their birth in the vapor of pipes and are dissipated and take their flight with them
but this good clermont could not be made pope because no priest was he and then their agent whose death burned with all their money back returned

the shock caused the cart and the orator to come to a dead halt
it was a beauceron made old and thin and onefit for the knacker which was dragging a very heavy cart
this incident attracted a crowd

and dahlia exclaimed there is cantine on the point of crying over horses

at that moment favourite folding her arms and throwing her head back looked resolutely art holon yes and said to me now
the surprise

the moment has arrived replied tho i oh yes
gentlemen the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck
wait for us a moment ladies
it begins with a kiss said bla chevelle
on the broward edt holon yes
favourite clapped her hands on their departure
it is begin gong to be amusing already said she
chapter is a merry end to mirth when the young girls were left alone they leaned two by two on the window sills chatting craning out their heads and talking from one window to the other
they saw the young men emerge from the cafe bombard a seminar m
the latter turned round made signs to them smiled and disappeared in that dusty sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the champs elysees
cried fantine
what are they going to bring us
said sep home
it will certainly be something pretty said dahlia
for my part said favourite i want it to be of gold
their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake which they could see through the branches of the large trees and which diverted them greatly
it was the hour for the departure of the mail coaches and diligence s
nearly all the stagecoaches for the south and west passed through the champs elysees
the majority followed the quay and went through the passy barrier
from moment to moment some huge vehicle painted yellow and black heavily loaded noisily harnessed rendered shapeless by trunks tarpaulins and valises full of heads which immediate lu disappeared rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge with rush for smoke and a half of fury grinding the pavements changing all the paving stones into steels
this uproar delighted the young girls
favourite exclaimed what a row
one would say that it was a pile of chains flying away
it chanced that one of these vehicles which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms halted for a moment then set out against a gallop
this surprised fantine
said she
i thought the diligence never stopped
favourite shrug yes her shoulders
this fan time is surprising
i am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity
she is dazzled by the simplest things
that is done every day
you do not know life my dear
in this manner a certain time elapsed
all at once favourite made a movement like a person who is just waking up
well said she and the surprise
yes by the way joined in dahlia the famous surprise
they are a very long time about it
said fantine
as fantine concluded this with the waiter who had served them at dinner entered
he held in his hand something which resembled a letter
what is that
demanded favourite
the walter replied it is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies
why did you not bring it at once
because said the waiter the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour
it was in fact a letter
shop
said she there is no address but this is what is written on it this is the surprise
she tore the letter open hastily opened it and read she knew how to read our beloved you must know that we have parents
parents you do not know much about such things
they are called fathers and mothers by the civil code which is puerile and honest
now these parents grown these old folks implore us these good men and these good women call us prodigal son w they desire our return and offer to kill valves for us
being virtuous we obey them
at the hour when you read this five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas
we are pulling up our stakes as bossuet days
we are going we are font
we flew in the arms of lafitte and on the wings of saillard
the toulouse diligence years us from the abyss and the abyss is you pour little beauties
we return to society to duty to respectability at full trot at the rate of three leagues an hour
it is necessary for the good of the country that we should be like the rest of the world prefects fathers of families rural police and councillors of state

mourn for us in haste and replace us with speed
if this letter lacerated you do the same by it

the four young women looked at each other
favourite was the first to break the silence

no sooner is he gone than he is loved
this is an adventure indeed
that is evident
in that case retorted favourite death to bla chevelle and long live full oh yes

exclaimed dahlia and ze phone
and they burst out laughing
fantine laughed with the rest
an hour later when she had returned to her room she wept
it was her first love affair as we have said she had given herself to this tho i oh yes as to a husband and the poor girl had a child
book fourth
this cookshop was kept by some people named thenardier husband and wife
it was situated in boulanger lane
over the door there was aboard nailed flat against the wall
upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back the latter wearing the big gilt epaulettes of a general with large silver stars red spots represented blood the rest of the picture consisted of smoke and probably represented a battle
below ran this inscription at the sign of sergeant of waterloo zus argent de waterloo
nothing is more common than a car for a truck at the door of a hostelry
nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the cookshop of the sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of would certainly have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed that way
it was the fore carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded traces of country and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees
this fire carriage was composed of a massive irondale tree with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and which was supported by two huge wheels
the whole thing was compact overwhelming and misshapen
it seemed like the gun carriage of an enormous cannon
the guts of the road had bestowed on the wheels the fellows the hub the axle and the shaft a layer of mud a hideous yellowish daubing hud tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornamenting cathedrals
the wood was disappearing under mud and the iron beneath rust
under the sale free hung like drapery a huge chain worthy of some goliath of a convict
this chain suggested not the beams which it was its office to transport but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness it had the air of the galleys but of cyclopean and superhuman valleys and it seemed to have been detached from some monster
homer would have found polyphemus with it and shakespeare caliban
why was that for a carriage of a truck in that place in the street
in the first place to encumber the street next in order that it might finish the process of rusting
there is a throng of institutions in the old social order which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors and which have no other reasons for existence than the above
the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle and in the loop as in the role of a swing there were seated and grouped on that particular evening in exquisite interlace ment two little girls one about two years and a half old the other eighteen months the younger in the arms of the other
a handkerchief cleverly knotted about them prevented their falling out
a mother had caught sight of that frightful cuz im and had said some
the two children who were dressed prettily and with some elegance were taxi and with pleasure one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron their eyes were a triumph their fresh cheeks were full of laughter
one had chestnut hair the other brown
their innocent faces were two delighted surprises a blossoming shrub which grew near wafted to the passers by perfumes which seemed to emanate from them the child or eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood
above and around these two delicate heads all made of happiness and steeped in light the gigantic fire carriage black with rust almost terrible all entangled in curved and wild angles rose in a vault like the entrance of a cavern
a few paces a part crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry then other not a very prepossessing woman by the way though touching at that moment was swinging the two children by means of a long does watching them carefully for fear of accidents with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity
at every backward and forward swing the hideous link admitted as trident sound which resembled a cry of rage the little girls were in ecstasies the setting sun mingled in this joy and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of titans the swing of cherubim
as she rocked her little ones the mother hummer in a discordant voices romance then celebrated it must be said a warrior
her song and the contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street
in the meantime someone had approached her as she was beginning the first couple for the romance and suddenly she heard a voice saying very near her ear you have two beautiful children there madame
to the fair and tender imogene replied the mother continuing her romance then she turned her head
a woman stood before her a few paces distant
this woman also had a child which she carried in her arms
she was carrying in addition a large carpet bag which seemed very heavy
it was a girl two or three years of age
she could have entered into competition with the two other little ones so far as the coquetry of her dress was concerned she wore a cap of fine linen ribbon won her bodice and valenciennes lace on her cap
the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view of her white firm and dimpled leg
she was admirably rosy and healthy
the little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks
of her eyes nothing could be known except that they must be very large and that they had magnificent lashes
she was asleep
she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age
the arms of mothers are made of tenderness in them children sleep profoundly
as for the mother her appearance was sad and poverty stricken
she was dressed like a working woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again
she was young
was she handsome
perhaps but in that attire it was not apparent
her hair a golden lock of which had escaped seemed very thick but was severely concealed beneath an ugly tight close n unlike cap tied under the chin
a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them but she did not smile
her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time
she was pale she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance
she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child
a large blue handkerchief such as the invalides use was folded into a fishy and concealed her figure clumsily
her hands were sunburnt and all fitted with freckles her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen a gift alone brown and coarse shoes
it was fantine
it was fantine but difficult to recognize
nevertheless on scrutinizing her attentively it was evident that she still retained her beauty
a melancholy food which resembled the he binging of irony wrinkled her right cheek
as for her toilette that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons which seemed made of mirth of folly and of music full of bells and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling hoarfrost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight it melts and leaves the branch quite black
ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce
what had taken place during those ten months
it can be divined
after abandonment straightened circumstances
fantine had immediately lost sight of favourites ephone and dahlia the bond once broken on the side of the men it was l lower between the women they would have been greatly astonished has anyone told them a fortnight later that they had been friends there no longer existed any reason for such a thing
fantine had remained alone
the father of her child gone alas
such ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure
drawn away by her liaison with tho longest i disdain the pretty trade which she knew she had neglected to keep her market open it was now closed to her
she had no resource
fantine barely knew how to read and did not know how to write in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name she had a public letter writer invite an epistle to tho longest benq second then a third
t holon yes replied to none of them
fantine heard the gossips say as they looked at her child who takes those children seriously
then she thought orthop oh yes who had shrugged his shoulders over his child and who did not take that innocent being seriously and her heart grew gloomy howard that man
but what was due to do
she no longer knew to whom to apply
she had committed a fault but the foundation of her nature as will be remembered was modesty and virtue
she was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress and of gliding into a word estate
courage was necessary she possessed it and held herself firm
the idea of returning to her native town of m
shrm
occurred to her
there someone might possibly know her and give her work yes but it would be necessary to conceal her fault
in a confused way she perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one
her heart contracted but she took her resolution
fantine as we shall see had the fierce bravery of life
she had already valiantly renounced finery g addressed herself in linen and had put all her silk call her ornaments all her ribbons and all her laces on her daughter the only vanity which was left to her and a holy one it was
she sold all that she had which produced for her two hundred francs her little debts paid she had only about eighty francs left
at the age of twenty two on a beautiful spring morning she quitted paris bearing her child on her back
anyone who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them
this woman had in all the world nothing but her child and the child had in all the world no one but this woman
fantine had nursed her child and this had hired her chest and she coughed a little
we shall have no further occasion to speak of m
felix tho i oh yes
let us confine ourselves to saying that twenty years later under king louis philippe he was a great provincial lawyer wealthy and influential asia selector and a very severe jury man he was still a manifold asked
towards the middle of the day after having from time to time for the sake of testing herself travelled for three or four sousa league in what was then known as the petites voitures de s environs de paris the little suburban coach service fan to be found herself at mont vermeil in the alley boulanger
as she passed the thenardier hostelry the two little girls blissful in the monsters wing had dazzled her in a manner and she had halted in front of that vision of joy
charms exist
these two little girls were a charm to this mother
she gazed at them in much emotion
the presence of angels is an announcement of paradise
she thought that above this inn she beheld the mysterious hereof providence
these two little creatures were evident in happy
she gazed at the us he admired them in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets other songs he could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read you have two pretty children madame
the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young
the mother raised her head and thanked her and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door she herself being seated on the threshold
the two women began to chat
my name is madame thenardier said the mother of the two little girls
we keep this inn
then her mind still running on her romance she resumed humming between her teeth it must be so i am a knight and i am off to palestine
she was a simpering but masculine creature
old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cookshop woman
she was still young she was barely thirty
of this crouching woman had stood upright her lofty stature and her frame of a per ambulating colossus suitable for fairs might have frightened the traveller at the outset troubled her confidence and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish
a person who is seated instead of standing erect destinies hang upon such a thing as that
the traveller told her story with slight modifications
that she was a working woman that her husband was dead that her work in paris had failed her and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere in her own native parts that she had left paris that morning on foot that as she was carrying her child and felt fatigued she had got into the ville kimble coach when she met it that from ville kimble she had come to mont vermeil on foot that the little one had walked a little but not much because she was so young and that she had been obliged to take her up and the jewel had fallen asleep
at this words he bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss which woke her
nothing with that serious and sometimes severe air of little children which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue
one would say that they feel themselves to be angels and that they know us to be men
then the child began to laugh and although the mother held fast to her she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run
all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing stopped short and put out her tongue in sign of admiration
mother thenardier released her daughters made them descend from the swing and said now amuse yourselves all three of you
children become acquainted quickly at that age and at the expiration of a minute the little the barriers were playing with the newcomer at making holes in the ground which was an immense pleasure
the newcomer was very gay the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly
the two women pursued their chat
cosette
for code there are up tracie
but out of e up bras is the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes josepha into pepita and francoise into willette
it is a sort of derivative which did arranges and did converts the whole science of etym ologists
we have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore in for non
how old issue
she is going on three
that is the age of my eldest
in the meantime the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissful need an event has happened a big worm had emerged from the ground and they were afraid and they were in ecstasies over it
their radiant brows touched each other one would have said that there were three heads in one aureole
how easily children get acquainted at once
exclaimed mother thenardier one would swear that they were three sisters
this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for
the thenardier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent not refusal
my work will not permit it
with a child one can find no situation
people are ridiculous in the country
it was the good god who caused me to pass touring
when i caught sight of your little ones so pretty so clean and so happy it overwhelmed me
that is just the thing that will make three sisters
will you keep my child for me
i must see about it replied the thenardier
i will give you six francs a month
and six months paid in advance
six times seven makes forty two said the thenardier
i will give it said the mother
total fifty seven france said madame thenardier
and she hummer vaguely with these figures it must be said a warrior
i will pay it said the mother
i have eighty france
i shall have enough left to reach the country by travelling on foot
i shall earn money there and as soon as i have a little i will return for my darling
that is my husband said the thenardier
of course she has an outfit the poor treasure
i understood perfectly that it was your husband
and a beautiful outfit you
a senseless outfit everything by the dozen and silk towns like a lady
it is here in my carpet bag
of course i shall give it to you said the mother
it would be very queer if i were to leave my daughter quite naked
the bargain was concluded
the mother passed the night at the inn gave up her money and left her child fastened her carpet bag once more now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit and light henceforth and set out on the following morning intending to return soon
people arrange such departures tranquilly but they are despairs
a neighbor of the the barriers met this mother as she was setting out and came back with the remark i have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart
do you know that i should have had a bailiff and a protest after me
you played the mousetrap nicely with your young ones
without suspecting it said the woman
chapter ii first sketch of two unprepossessing figures the house which had been caught was a pitiful specimen but the cat rejoice seven over a lean mouse
who were these the barriers
let us say a word or two of them now
we will complete the sketch later on
these beings belonged to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale which is between the class called middle and the class denominated as inferior and which combines some of the effects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first without possessing the generous impulse of the working man nor the honest order of the bourgeois
they were of those dwarfed natures which if a full fire chances to warn them up easily become monstrous
there was in the woman a substratum of the brute and in the man the material for a blackguard
both were susceptible in the highest degree of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil
there exist crab like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness retro trading in life rather than advancing employing experience to augment their deformity growing incessantly worse and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever augmenting blackness
this man and woman possessed such souls
thenardier in particular was troublesome for a physiognomic t
one can only look at some men to distrust them for one feels that they are dark in both directions
they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front
there is something of the unknown about them
one can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do
the shadow which they bear in their glance denounces the m
from merely tearing them utter a word of seeing them make a gesture one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future
this thenardier if he himself was to be believed had been a soldier a sergeant he said
he had probably been through the campaign of and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor it would seem
we shall see later on how much truth there was in this
the sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his fears of arms
he had painted it himself for he knew how to do a little of everything and badly
it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which after having been ciel le was no longer anything but lido isla still noble but ever more and more vulgar having fallen from mademoiselle de scuderi to madame bourbon k alarms and from madame de la fayette to madame barthelemy had it was setting the loving hearts of the old tresses of paris aflame and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent
madame thenardier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books
she lived on them
in them she frowned what brains she possessed
this had given her when very young and even a little later a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband as camp of a certain depth a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar coarse and find a tone and the same time but so far as sentimentalism was concerned given to the perusal of pi fault le brun and in what concerns the sea as he said in his jargon a downright unmitigated lout
his wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was
later on when her hair arranged in a romantically dropping fashion began to grow gray when the magadha began to be develop cd from the pamela the female thenardier was nothing but a coarse vicious woman who had dabbled in stupid romances
how one can not read nonsense with impunity
the result was that her eldest daughter was named eponine as for the younger the poor little thing came near being called gulnare i know not to what diversion effected by a romance of duct aucune nil she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of a selma
however we will remark by the way everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluring and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal names
by the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social sympton
this displacement which places the elegant name on the plebeian and the rustic name in the aristocratic nothing else than an eddy of equality
the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else
beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing the french revolution
chapter iii the park it is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper
the cookshop was in a bad way
on the following month they were again in need of money
as soon as that sum was spent the the barriers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity and they treated her accordingly
as she had no longer any clothes they dressed her in the cast off petticoats and chemises of the thenardier beats that is to say in rags
they fed her on what all the rest had left a little better than the dog a little worse than the cat
moreover the cat and the dog were her habitual table companions cosette are with them under the table from a wooden bowl similar to the irs
the mother who had established herself as we shall see later on atm
shrm
write or more correctly caused to be written a letter every month that she might have news of her child
the the barriers replied invariably cosette is doing wonderfully well
at the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month
the year was not completed when the barrier said a fine favors he is doing is in sooth
what does she expect us to do with her seven france
and he wrote to demand twelve france
the mother whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy and was coming on well submitted and for war see the twelve france
certain natures can not love on the one hand without hating on the other
mother thenardier loved her two daughters passion ately which caused her to hate the stranger
it is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects
little as was the space occupied by cosette it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed
this woman like many women other sort had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and in juries to dispense each day
if she had not had cosette it is certain that her daughters idolized as they were would have received the whole of it but the stranger viet nam the service to divert the blows to herself
her daughters received nothing but caresses
cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent blows and unmerited chastisement
the sweet treble being who should not have understood anything of this world or of god incessantly punished scolded ill used beaten and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself who lived in a day of dawn
madame the barrier was vicious with cosette
eponine and a selma were vicious
children at that age are only copies of their mother
the size is smaller that is all
a year passed then another
people in the village said those thenardier care good people
they are not rich and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands
in the meanwhile thenardier having learned it is impossible to say by what obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the mother could not acknowledge it exacted fifteen francs a month saying that the creature was growing and eating and threatening to send her away
i must have an increase
the mother paid the fifteen france
from year to hear the child grew and so did her wretchedness
as long as cosette was little she was the scapegoat of the two other choker rn as soon as she began to develop a little that is to say before she was even five years old she became the servant of the household
five years old
the reader will say that is not probable
alas
it is true
social suffering begins at all ages
have we got recently seen the trial of a man named du millard an orphan turned bandit who from the age office as the official documents state being alone in the world worked for his living and stole
cosette was made to run on errands to sweep the rooms the courtyard the street to wash the wishes to even carry burdens
the the barriers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner since the mother who was still atm
shrm
had become irregular in her payments
some months she was in arrears
if this mother had returned to mont vermeil at the end of these three years she would not have recognized her child
cosette so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house was now thin and lake
she had an indescribably uneasy look
the sky creature said the the harriers
injustice has made her peevish and misery had made her ugly
nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes which inspired pain because large as they were it seemed as though one be held in the ma still larger amount of sadness
it was a heartbreaking thing to see this poor child not yet six years old shivering in the winner in her old days of linen full of holes sweeping the street before daylight with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands and a year in her great eyes
illustration cossette sweeping b cossette sweeping she was called the park in the neighborhood
the populace who are fond of these figures of speech had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling frightened and shivering little creature no bigger than a bird who was awake every morning before anyone else in the house of the village and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak
only the little park never sang
book fifth
the descent
chapter i the history of a progress in black glass trinkets and in the meantime what had become of that mother who according to the people at mont vermeil seemed to have abandoned her child
where was she
what was she doing
after leaving her little cosette with the thenardier as he had continued her journey and had reached m
shrm
this it will be remembered was in
fantine had quitted her province ten years before
j
shrm
had changed its aspect
while fantine had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness her native town has prospered
about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place
this detail is important and we regard it as useful to develop it at length we should almost say to underline it
from time immemorial m
shrm
had had for its special industry the imitation of english jet and the black glass trinkets of germany
this industry has always vegetated on account of the high price of the raw material which reached on the manufacture
at the moment when can find returned to m
sutm
an unheard of transformation had taken place in the production of black goods
towards the close of a man a stranger had established himself in the town and had been inspired with the idea of substituting in this manufacturer uml actor resin and for bracelets in particular slides of sheet iron simply paid together for slides of soldered sheet iron
this very small change had effected a revolution
this very small change had in fact prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material which had rendered it possible in the first place to raise the price of manufacture a benefit to the country in the second place to improve the workmanship an advantage to the consumer in the third place to sell at a lower price while trebling the profit which was a benefit to the manufacturer
thus three results ensued from one idea
in less than three years the inventor of this process has become rich which is good and had made everyone about him rich which is better
he was a stranger in the department
of his origin nothing was known of the beginning of his career very little
it was rumored that he had come to town with very little money a few hundred francs at the most
it was from this slender capital enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea developed by method and thought that he had drawn his own fortune and the fortune of the whole countryside
on his arrival at m
shrm
he had only the garments the appearance and the language of a working man
it appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of m
shrm
just at nightfall on a december evening knapsack on back and thorn club in hand a large fire had broken out in the town hall
this man had rushed into the flames and saved at the risk of his own life two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport
afterwards they had learned his name
he was called father madeleine
chapter ii madeleine he was a man about fifty years of age who had a pre occupied air and who was good
that was all that could be said about him
thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably reconstructed m
shrm
had become a rather important centre of trade
spain which consumes a good deal of black men have enormous purchases there each year
m
shrm
almost rivalled london and berlin in this branch of commerce
anyone who was hungry could present himself there and was sure of finding employment and bread
father madeleine required of the men goodwill of the women lord morals and of all probity
he had separated the work rooms in order to separate the sexes and so that the women and girls might remain discreet
on this point he was inflexible
it was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant
he was all the more firmly set on this severity since m
shrm
being a garrison town opportunities for corruption abounded
however his coming had been a boon and his presence was a godsend
a strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere
slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown
there was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money if it now selling solidly that there was not some little not within it
father madeleine gave employment to everyone
he exacted but one thing be an honest man
be an honest a plan
as we have said in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot father madeleine made his fortune but a singular thing in a simple man of business it did not seem as though that were his chief care
he appeared to be thinking much of others and little of himself
in he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with laffitte but before reserving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor
the hospital was badly endowed he founded six beds there
m

is divided into the upper and the lower town
the lower town in which he lived had but one schools miserable novel which was falling to ruin be constructed two one for girls the other for boys
he allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary and one day he said to someone who expressed surprise the two prime functionaries of the state are the nurse and the schoolmaster
he created at his own expense an infant school a thing then almost unknown in france and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen
as his factory was a centres new quarter in which there were a good many indigent families rose rapidly around him he established there a free dispensary
when they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself the good would said he is an ambitious man
this seemed all the more probable since the man was religious and even practiced his religion to a certain degree a thing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch
he went regularly top is made every sunday
the local deputy who noses out all rivalry everywhere soon began to grow uneasy over this religion
he indulged in gentle raillery at god with closed doors
ambition was at that time in the direct acceptation of the words race to the steeple
the poor profited by this terror as well as the good god for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital which made twelve
nevertheless in a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country father madeleine was to be appointed by the king mayor of m
shrm
those who had pronounced this newcomer to be an ambitious fellow seized with delight in this opportunity which all men desire to exclaim there
what did we say
all m
shrm
was in an uproar
the rumor was well found w w
several days later the appointment appeared in the moniteur
on the following day father madeleine refused
in this same year of the products of the new process invented by madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition when the jury made their report the king appointed the inventors chevalier of the legion of honor
a fresh excitement in the little town
well so it was the cross that he wanted
father madeleine refused the cross
decidedly this man was an enigma
the good souls got out of their predicament by saying after all he is some sort of an adventurer
we have seen that the country owed much to him the poor owed him everything he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him
his work men in particular adored him and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity
when he was known to be rich people in society bowed to him and he received invitations in the town he was called in town monsieur madeleine his work men and the children continued to call him father madeleine and that was what was most adapted to make him smile
in proportion as he mounted thrive invitations rained down upon him
society claimed him for its own
the prim little drawing room son m
shrm
which of course had at first been closed to the african opened both leaves of their folding doors to the million naire
they made a thousand advances to tim
he refused
this time the good gossips had no trouble
he is an ignorant man of no education
no one knows where he came from
he would not know how to behave in society
it has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read
when they saw him making money they said he is a man of business
when they saw him scattering his money about they said he is an ambitious man
when he was seen to decline honors they said he is an adventurer
when they saw him repulse society they said he is a brute
in five years after his arrival in m
shrm
the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling the opinion of the whole country roundabout was so unanimous that the king again appointed him mayor of the town
he again declined but the prefect resisted his refusal all the not abilities of the place came to implore him the people in the street besought him the urging was so rigorous that he ended by accepting
it was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people who called to him from her threshold in an angry way a good mayor is a useful thing
is he drawing back before the good which he can do
this was the third phase of his ascent
father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine
monsieur madeleine became monsieur lemaire
chapter iii sums deposited with laffitte on the other hand he remained as simple as on the first day
he had gray hair a serious eye the sunburned complexion of a laborer the thoughtful visage of a philosopher
he habitually words met with a wide brim and a long coat of coarse cloth buttoned to the chin
he fulfilled his duties as mayor but with that exception he lived in solitude
he spoke to but few people
he avoided polite attention she escaped quickly he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking he gave in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling the women sale of him what a good natured bear
his pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields
he always took his meals alone with an open book before him which he read
he had a well selected little library
he loved books books are cold but safe friends
in proportion as leisure came to him with fortune he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind
it had been observed that ever since his arrival at m
sutm
his language had grown more polished more choice and more gentle with every passing year
he liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls but he rarely made use of it
when he did happen to do so his shooting was something so infallible as to inspire terror
he never killed an inoffensive animal
he never shot at a little bird
although he was no longer young it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong
he offered his assistance to anyone who was in need of it lifted a horse released a wheels logged in the mud or stopped a runaway bull by the horns
he always had his pockets full of money when he went out but they were empty on his return
when he passed through a village the ragged bears fan joyously after him and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats
it was thought that he must in the past have lived a country life since he knew all sorts of useful secrets which he taught to the peasants
he taught them how to destroy a cure on wheat by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt and how to chase away weevils by hanging up or foot in bloom everywhere on the walls and the ceilings among the grass and in the houses
he had recipes for exterminating from a field flight rates foxtail and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat
he defended a rabbit warren against rate simply by the odor of a guinea pig which he placed on it
one day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles be examined the plants which were uprooted and already dried and said they are dead
nevertheless it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them
when the nettle is going the leaf makes an excellent vegetable when it is older it has filaments and bob re spike hemp and flax
nettle cloth is as good as linen cloth
chopped up nettles are good for poultry pounded they are good for horned cattle
the seed of the nettle mixed with fodder gives gloss to the hair of animals the root mixed with salt produces a beautiful yellow coloring matter
moreover it is an excellent may which can be cut twice
and what is required for the nettle
a little soil nov are no culture
only the seed falls as it is ripe and it is difficult to collect it
that is all
with the exercise of a little care the nettle could be made useful it is neglected and it becomes hurtful
it is exterminated
how many men resemble the nettle
he added after a pause remember this my friends there are no such things as bad plants or bad men
there are only bad cultivators
the children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoanuts
when he saw the door of a church hung in black he entered he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings
widowhood and the grief of others attracted him because of his great gentleness he mingled with the friends clad in mourning with families dressed in black with the priests groaning around a coffin
he seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psal movies filled with the vision of the other world
with his eyes fixed in heaven he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death
he performed a multitude of good actions concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions
he penetrated houses privately at night he ascended staircases furtively
a poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened sometimes even forced during his absence
the poor man made a clamor over it some malefactor had been there
he entered and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgotten in some piece of furniture
the male factor who had been there was rather madeleine
he was affable and sad
the people said there is a rich man who has not a haughty air
there is a happy man who has not a contented air
this was much talked of so that one of the elegant and malicious young woman of m
shrm
came to him one day and asked monsieur le hair spray show us your chamber
it is said to be a grotto
he smiled and introduced them instantly into this grotto
they were well punished for their curiosity
the room was very simply furnished in mahogany which was rather ugly like all furniture of that sort and hung with paper worth twelve sous
they could see nothing remarkable about it except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney piece and appeared to be solved for they were hallmarked an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns
it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with laffitte with this peculiar feature that they were always at his immediate disposal so that it was added m
in reality these two or three millions were reducible as we have said to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs
chapter iv m
madeleine in mourning at the beginning of the newspapers announced the death of m
muriel bishop of d surnames monseigneur bienvenu who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty two
the bishop off to supply here a detail which the papers omitted had been bound for many years before his death and content to be blind as his sister was beside him
let us remark by the way that to be blind and to beloved is in fact one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth where nothing is complete
to be served in distress is to be caressed
does he lack anything
no
one does not lose the sight when one has love
and what life
a love wholly constituted of virtue
there is no blindness where there is certainty
soul seeks soul grill ugly and finds it
and this soulbound and tested is a woman
ah and sustains you it usher exmouth lightly touched your brow it is her mouth you hear a breath very near you it is here
the heart that obscure celestial flower undergoes a mysterious blossoming
one would not exchange that shadow for all brightness
the angel soul is there uninterruptedly there if she departs it is but to return again she vanished like a dream and reappears like reality
one feels warmth approaching and behold
she is there
one overflows with serenity with gayety with ecstasy one is a radiance amid the night
and there are a thousand little cards
no things which are enormous in that void
the most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you and supplying the vanished universe to you
one of caressed with the soul
one sees nothing but one feels that one is adored
it is a paradise of shadows
it was from this paradise that monseigneur welcome had passed to the other
the announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of m
shrm
on the following day m
madeleine appeared clad wholly in black and with craps on his hat
this mourning was noticed in the town and commented on
it seemed to throws light on m
it was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable bishop
he has gone into mourning for the bishop off said the drawing rooms this raised m
shrm
the microscopic faubourg saint germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against m
madeleine the probable relative of a bishop
k
madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained by the more numerous courtesies of the old women and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones
one evening a ruler in that petty great world who was curious by right of seniority ventured to ask him m
lemaire is doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d
he said no madame
but resumed the dowager you are wearing mourning for him
he replied it is because i was a servant in his family in my youth
another thing which was remarked was that every time that he encountered in the town a young savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimney a to sweep the mayor had him summoned inquired his name and gave him money
the little savoyards told each other about it a great many of them passed that way
chapter v vague flashes on the horizon little by little and in the course of time all this opposition subsided
there had at first been exercised against m
madeleine in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to blackening and calumnies then they grew to be nothing more than ill nature then merely malicious remarks then even this entirely disappeared respect became complete unanimous cordial and towards the moment arrived when the word monsieur lemaire was pronounced atm
shrm
with almost the same accent as monseigneur the bishop had been pronounced in din
people came from a distance often leagues around to consult m
madeleine
he put an end to differences be prevented lawsuits be reconciled enemies
everyone took him for the judge and with good reason
it seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law
it was like an epidemic of generation which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district
one single man in the town in the arrondissement absolutely escaped this contagion and whatever father madeleine did remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy
it seems in fact as though there existed in certain ken a veritable bestial instinct though pure and upright like all instincts which creates antipathies and sympathies which fatally separated in enature from another nature which does not hesitate which feels no disquiet which does not hold its peace and which never be lies itself clear in its obscurity infallible imperious intractable stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dis solvents of reason and which in whatever manner destinies are arranged secretly warns them and i got the presence of the man cat and the man box of the presence of the man lion
it frequently happened that she gm
madeleine was passing along a street calm affectionate surrounded by the blessings of all a man of lofty stature clad in an iron gray frock coat armed with a heavy cane and wearing a battered hat turned round abruptly behind him and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared with folded arms and as low shake of the head and his upper lip raised in company with his power to his nose a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by what is that man after all
i certainly have seen him somewhere
in any case i am not his dupe
his name was made grand he belonged to the police
agm
such
he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector
hacer board the post which he occupied to the protection of m
chan phil let the secretary of the minister of state comte angeles then prefect of police at paris
when javert arrived at m
shrm
the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine
certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority
javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness
it is our conviction that of souls were visible to the eyes we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to someone of the species of the animal creation and we could easily recognize this truth hardly perceived by the thinker that from the oyster to the eagle from the pig to the tiger all animals exist in man and that each one of the mishna man
sometimes even several of them at a time
animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our vices straying before our eyes the visible phantoms of our souls
how shows them to us in order to induce us to reflect
only since animals are here shadows god has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word what is the use
on the contrary our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them god has bestowed on them intelligence that is to say the possibility of education
social education when well done can always draw from a soul of whatever sort it may be the utility which it contains
this be it said is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man
the visible i in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the latent i
having made this reservation let us pass on
now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation it will be easy for us to say what there was in police officer javert
the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog which is killed by the mother because otherwise as he grew up he would devour the other little ones
give to this dobson of adolf a human face and the result will be javert
javert had been born in prison of a fortune teller whose husband was in the galleys
as he grew up he thought that he was outside the pale of society and he despaired of ever reentering it
he observed that society in pardoning it excludes two classes of men those who attack it and those who guard if he had no choice except between these two classes at the same time he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity regularity and probity complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung
he entered the police he succeeded there
at forty years of age he was an inspector
during his youth he had been employed in the conduct establishments of the south
before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the words human face which we have just applied to javert
the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose with two deep nostrils towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks
one felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time
when javert laughed and his laugh was rare and terrible his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth but his gums and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage fold as on the muzzle of a wild beast
is very serious was a watchdog when he laughed he was a tiger
as for the rest he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows between his eyes there was a permanent central brown like an imprint of wrath his gaze was obscure his mouth purse duo and terrible h i said that of ferocious command
this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments comparatively but he rendered them almost had by dint of exaggerating them respect for authority hatred of rebellion and in his eyes murder robbery all crimes are only forms of rebellion
he enveloped in a blind and profound faith everyone who had a function in the state from the prime minister to the rural policeman
he covered with scorn aversion and disgust everyone who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil
he was absolute and admitted no exceptions
on the one hand he said the functionary can take no mistake the magistrate is never the wrong
on the other hand he said these men are irremediably list
nothing good can come from them
he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know not what power of making or if the reader will have it so of authenticating demons and who places styx at the base of society
he was stoical serious austere a melancholy dreamer humble and haughty like fanatics
his fiance was like a gimlet cold and piercing
his whole life hung on these two words watchfulness and supervision
he had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world he possessed the conscience of his usefulness the religion of his functions and he was a spy as other men are priests
woe to the man who fell into his hands
he would have arrested his own father of the latter had escaped from the valleys and would have denounced his mother if she had broken her bag
and he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue
and withal a life of privation isolation abnegation chastity with never a diversion
it was implacable duty the police under atoka as the spartans understood sparta a pitiless lying in wait a ferocious honesty a marble informer brutus in vidocq
the mystical school of joseph de maistre which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers would not have failed to declare that have rt was a symbol
his brow was not visible it disappeared beneath his hat his eyes were not visible since they were lost under his eyebrows his chin was not visible for it was plunged in his drag at his hands were not visible they were drawn up in his sleeves and his cane was not visible he carried it under his coat
but when the occasion presented itself there was suddenly seen to emerge from all this shadow as from an ambuscade a narrow and angular forehead a baleful glance a threatening chin enormous hands and a monstrous cudgel
in his leisure moments which were far from frequent he read although he hated books this caused him to be not wholly illiterate
this could be recognised by some emphasis in his speech
as we have said he had no vices
when he was pleased with himself be permitted himself a pinch of snuff
there inlay his connection with humanity
the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that have rt was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry of justice designated under the rubric vagrants
the name of javert routes them by its mere utterance the face of javert petrified them at sight
such was this formidable man
javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m
madeleine
an eye full of suspicion and conjecture
m
madeleine had finally perceived the fact but it seemed to be of no importance to him
he did not even put a question to have true neither sought hot avoided him before that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it
he treated javert with ease and courtesy as he did all the rest of the world
it was divined from some words which escaped javert that he had secretly investigated with that curiosity which belongs to the race and onto which there enters as much instinct as will all the anterior traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere
he seemed to know and he sometimes said in covert words that someone had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared
once he chanced to say as he was talking to himself i think i have him
then he remained pensive for three days and uttered not a word
it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken
moreover and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the top absolute sense which certain words might present there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused thrown off the track and defeated
otherwise it would be superior to intelligence and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man
javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of m
madeleine
one day nevertheless his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on m
madeleine
it was in the following occasion
chapter vi father rauch elegent one morning m
madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m
shrm
he heard a noise and saw a group some distance away
he approached
an old man named father rauch eleventh adjust fallen beneath his car thus horse having tumbled down
this raychel event was one of the few enemies who mm
madeleine had at that time
when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood raychel event and a notary and a peasant who was almost educated had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way
raychel event had seen this simple workman grow rich while he a lawyer was being ruined
this had filled him with jealousy and he had done all he could on every occasion to injure madeleine
then bankruptcy had come and as the old man had nothing left but scary and a horse and neither family nor children he had turned carter
the horse had two broken legs and could not rise
the old man was caught in the wheels
the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast
the cart was quite heavily laden
father raychel event was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner
they had tried but in vain to drag him out
an un methodical effort aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him
it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him
javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for a jackscrew
m
madeleine arrived
people stood aside respectfully
help
cried old raychel event
who will be good and save the old man
m
madeleine turned towards those present is there a jackscrew to be had
one has been sent for answered the peasant
how long will it take to get it
a quarter of an hour
exclaimed madeleine
it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked
it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more
it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to the peasants who were staring at him
we must
but it will be too late then
well
listen resumed madeleine there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back
only half a minute and the poor man can be taken out
is there anyone here who has stout loins and heart
not a man in the group stirred
ten louis said madeleine
the persons present dropped their eyes
one of them muttered a man would need to be devilish strong
and then he runs the risk of getting crushed
some began madeleine again twenty louis
the same silence
it is not the will which is lacking said a voice
m
madeleine turned round and design used javert
he had not noticed him on his arrival
javert went on it is strength
one would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lifts cart like that on his back
then gazing fixedly at m
madeleine he went on emphasizing every word that he uttered monsieur madeleine i have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask
madeleine shuddered
javert added with an air of indifference but without removing his eyes from madeleine he was a convict
ah
said madeleine
in the galleys at toulon
madeleine turned pale
meanwhile the cart continued to sink slowly
father raychel event rattled on the throat and shrieked i am strangling
my ribs are breaking
a screw
something
ah
madeleine glanced about him
is there then no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man
no one stirred
javert resumed i have never known buy one man who could take the place of a screw and he was that convict
ag
it is crushing me
cried the old man
then without saying a word he fell on his knees and before the crowd had even had time to utter a crime was underneath the vehicle
a terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued
they beheld madeleine almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together
they shouted to him father madeleine come out
old raychel event himself said to him monsieur madeleine go away
you see that i am fated to die
leave me
you will get yourself crushed also
madeleine made no reply
all the spectators were panting
the wheels has continued to sink and it had become almost impossible for madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle
suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver the cart rose slowly the wheels half emerged from the ruts
they heard as to view voice crying make haste
help
it was madeleine who had just made a final effort
they rushed forward s
the devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all
the fart was raised by twenty arms
old raychel event was saved
madeleine rose
he was pale though dripping with perspiration
his clothes were torn and covered with mud
all wept
the old man kissed his knees and called him the good god
as for him he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering and he fixed his tranquil eye on javert who was still staring at him
chapter vii raichel event becomes a gardener in paris rauch eleventh as dislocated his knee pan in his fall
father madeleine had him conveyed town infirmary which he had established for his work men in the factory building itself and which was served by two sisters of charity
the cart was broken and the horse was read
fw uchel event recovered but his knee remained stuff
m
madeleine on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest got the goodman a place as gardener in a female convent in the rue saint antoine in paris
some time afterwards m
madeleine was appointed major
the first time that is very he held m
from that time forth be avoided him as much as he possibly could
when the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor be addressed him with profound respect
this prosperity created atm
shrm
by father madeleine had besides the visible signs which we have mentioned another symptom which was nonetheless significant for not being visible
this never deceived
when the population suffers when work is lacking when there is no commerce the taxpayer resists imposts through penury he exhausts and over steps his respite and the states spends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection
when work is abundant when the country is rich and happy the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing
it may be said that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches the cost of collecting the taxes
in the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three fourths in the arrondissement pfm
shrm
and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by m
deville of them minister of finance
such was the condition of the country when fantine returned thither
no one remembered her
fortunately the door of m
chapter viii madame vic turn own expense thirty france on morality when fantine saw that she was making her living she felt joyful for a moment
to live honestly by her own labor what mercy from heaven
the taste for work had really returned to her
she bought a looking glass took pleasure in surveying in other youth her beautiful hair herring teeth she forgot many things she thought only of rosetta and of the possible future and was almost happy
she hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work a lingering trace of her improvident days
as she was not able to say that she was married she took good care as we have seen nor to mention her little girl
at first as the reader has seen she paid the the barriers promptly
as she only knew how to sign netnames he was obliged to write through a public letter writer
she wrote often and this was noticed
why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall
why does mr
so and so never hang his key on its nail on tuesday
why does he always take the narrow streets
why does madame always descend from her hackney coach before reaching her house
etc
there exist beings who for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas which are moreover of no consequence whatever to them spend more money waste more time take more trouble than would be required for ten good actions and that gratuitously for their own pleasure without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity
they will follow up such and such a major woman for whole days they will do sentry duty for hours at a time on the corners of the streets under alleyway doors at night in cold and rain they will bribes transporters they will make the drivers of hackney coaches and lackeys tipsy buy awaiting maid subpena potter
any
for no reason
a pure passion for seeing knowing and penetrating into things
a pure itch for talking
and often these secrets once known these mysteries made public these enigmas illuminated by the light of day bring on catastrophies fuels failures the ruin of families and broken lives to the great joy of those who have found out everything without any interest in the matter and by pure instinct
a sad thing
certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking
their conversation the chat of the drawing room gossip of the anteroom is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly they need a great amount of combustibles and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors
did anyone was watches
in addition many a one was jealous of her golden hair and other white teeth
it was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside in the midst of the rest to wipe away a year
these were the moments when she was thinking of her child perhaps also of the man whom she had loved
breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mouthful task
it was observed that she wrote twice a month at least and that she paid the carriage on the letter
they managed to obtain the address monsieur monsieur thenardier innkeeper at mont vermeil
the public writers good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets was made to talk in the wine shop
in short it was discovered that fantine had a child
she must be a pretty sort of a woman
an old gossip was found who made the trip to mont vermeil talked to the thenardier sand said in her return for my five and thirty francs i have freed my mind
i have seen the child
madame vic turn ken was fifty six and teen forced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age
a quavering voice a whimsical mind
this old dame had once been going astonishing fact
she was dry rough peevish sharp captious almost venomous all this in memory of her monk whose widow she was and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will
she was a nettle in which the rustle of the cassock was visible
at the restoration she had turned bigot and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk
she had a small property which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community
she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of areas
so this madame vic turn ken went to mont vermeil and returned with the remark i have seen the child
all this took time
this was the very month when the the barriers after having demanded twelve france instead of such adjusted after fifteen france instead of twelve
fantine was overwhelmed
she could not leave the neighborhood she was in debt formed rent and furniture
fifty france was not sufficient to cancel this debt
she stammered a few supplicating words
the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant
besides fantine was only a moderately good work woman
overcome with shame even more than with despair she quitted the shop and returned to her room
so her fault was now known to everyone
she no longer felt strong enough to say a word
she was advised to see the mayor she did not care
the mayor had given her foggy france because he was good and had dismissed her because he was just
she bowed before the decision
but m
madeleine had heard nothing of all this
life is full of just such combinations of events
m
at the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster whom the priest had provided for him and he had full confidence in this superintendent a truly respectable person firm equitable upright full of the charity which consists in giving but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and unforgiving
m
madeleine relief wholly on her
the best men are often obliged to delegate their authority
it was with this full power and the conviction that she was doing right that the superintendent has instituted the suit judged condemned and executed fantine
as regards the fifty france she had given them from a fund which m
madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes and for giving assistance to the work women and of which she rendered no account
fantine tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood she went from house to house
no one would have her
she could not leave town
the second hand dealer to whom she was in debt for her furniture and what furniture
said to her if you leave i will have you arrested as a thief
the householder whom she owed for her rent said to her you are young and pretty you can pay
she divided the fifty france between the landlord and the furniture dealer returned to the latter three quarters of his goods kept only necessaries and found herself with kit work without a trade with nothing but her bed and still about fifty france indent
she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison and earned twelve sousa day
her daughter cost herter
it was at this point that she began to pay the thenardier s irregularly
however the old woman who lighted her candle former when she rd burned at night taught her the art of living in misery
back of living on little there is the living on nothing
these are the two chambers the first is dark the second is black
no one knows all that certain feeble creatures who have grown old in privation and honesty can get out of a sou
it ends by being a talent
fantine acquired this sublime talent and regained a little courage
at this epoch she said to a neighbor bag
i say to myself by only sleeping five hours and working all the rest of the time at my sewing i shall always manage to nearly earn my bread
and then when one is sad one eats less
well sufferings uneasiness a little bread on one hand trouble on the other all this will support me
it would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress
she thought of having her come
but what then
make her share her own destitution
and then she was in debt to the the barriers
how could she pay them
and the journey
how pay for that
the old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence was a sainted spinster named marguerite who was pious with a true piety poor and charitable towards the poor and even towards the rich knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself marguerite and believing in god which is science
there are many such virtuous people in this lower world someday they will be in the world above
this life has a morrow
at first cantina had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out
when she was in the streets he divined that people turned round behind her and pointed at her everyone stared at her and boone greeted her the cold and bitter scorn of the passers by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a northwind
it seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns
in paris at least no one knows you and this obscurity is a garment
oy
how she would have liked to be take herself to paris
impossible
she was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute as she has accustomed herself to indigence
gradually she decided on her course
at the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter
it is all the same time she said
she went and came bearing her head well up with a bitter smile and was conscious that she was becoming brazen faced
madame vic turn ken sometimes saw her passing from her window noticed the distress of that creature who thanks to her had been put back in her proper place and congratulated herself
the happiness of the evil minded is black
excess of toil wore out fantine and the little dry cough which troubled her increased
she sometimes said to her neighbor marguerite just feel how got my hands are
nevertheless when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb and it flowed about her like floss silk she experie need a moment of happy coquetry
chapter x result of the success she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter the summer passed but winter came again
short days less work
winter no warmth no light no noonday the evening joining onto the morning find twilight the window is gray it is impossible to see clearly at it
the sky is but a vent hole
the whole day is a cavern
the sun has the air of a beggar
a frightful season
winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone
her creditors harrassed her
fantine earned too little
her debts had increased
the the barriers who were not promptly paid wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair and whose carriage ruined her
one day they wrote to her that her little cosette was entirely naked in that cold weather that she needed a woollen skirt and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this
she received the letter and crushed it in her hands all day long
ber admirable golden hair fell to her knees
what splendid hair
exclaimed the barber
how much will you give me for it
said she
ten france
cut it off
she purchased a knitted petticoat and sent it to the thenardier s
this petticoat made the the barriers furious
it was the money that they wanted
they gave the petticoat to eponine
the poor lack continued to shiver
fantine thought my child is no longer sold
i have clothed her with my hair
she put on little round caps which concealed news horn head and in which she was still pretty
when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair she began to hate everyone about her
she had long shared the universal veneration for father madeleine yet by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her that he was the cause of her unhappiness she came to hate him also and most of all
when she passed the factory in working hours when the work people were at the doors be affected to laugh and sing
she took a loved the first who offered a man whom she did not live out of bravado and with rage in her heart
he was a miserable scamp a sort of mendicant musicians lazy beggar who beat her and who abandoned her as she had taken him in disgust
she adores her child
the powers he descended the darker everything grew about her the more radiant stone that little angel at the bottom of her heart
she said when i get rich i will have my cosette with me and she laughed
her court did not leave her and she had sweats on her back
one day she received from the the barriers a letter couched in the following terms cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood
a miliary fever they call it
expensive drugs are required
this is ruining us and we can no longer pay for them
if you do not send us for the dance before the week is out the little one will be dead
she burst out laughing and said to her old neighbor am
they are good
forty france
the idea
that makes two napoleons
where do they think i am to get them
these peasants are stupid truly
nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more
then she descended the stairs and emerged running and leaping and still laughing
someone met her and said to her what makes you spray
she replied a fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written time
they demand for the dance of me
so much for you you peasants
as she crossed the square she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape up on the top of which stood a man dressed in red who was holding forth
he was a quack dentist in his rounds who was offering to the public full sets of teeth opiates powders and elixirs
fantine mingled in the group and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people
the tooth pulled espied the lovely laughing girl and suddenly exclaimed you have beautiful teeth you girl there who are laughing if you want to sell me your palettes i will give you a good napoleon a piece for them
what are my palettes
asked fantine
the palettes replied the dental professor are the front teeth the two upper ones
how horrible
exclaimed fantine
two napoleons
grumbled a toothless old woman who was present
fantine fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her reflect mybeauty
two napoleons they may prove of service
fantine returned home
she was furious and related the occurrence to her good neighbor marguerite can you understand such a thing
is he not an abominable man
how can they allow such people to go about the country
pull out my two front teeth
why i should be horrible
my hair will grow again but my teeth
ah
what a monster of a man
i should prefer to throw myself headfirst on the pavement from the fifth story
and what did he offer
asked marguerite
two napoleons
that makes forty france
yes said fantine that makes forty france
she remained thoughtful and began her work
on her returns he said to marguerite who was at work beside her what is a biliary fever
do you know
yes answered the old spinster it is a disease
does it require many drugs
oh
terrible drugs
how does one get it
it is a malady that one gets without knowing how
then it attacks children
children in particular
do people die of it
they may said marguerite
fan time left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase
that evening she went out and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the rue de paris where the inns are situated
she had not lain down
her cap had fallen on her knees
her candle had burned all night and was almost entirely consumed
marguerite halted on the threshold petrified at this tremendous wastefulness and exclaimed lord
the candle is all burned out
something has happened
then she looked at fantine who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair
fantine had grown ten years older since the preceding night
jesus
said marguerite what is the matter with you can find
nothing replied fantine
quite the contrary
my child will not die of that frightful malady for lack of succor
i am content
so saying she pointed out to the spinster two napoleons which were glittering in the table
ag
jesus god
cried marguerite
why it is a fortune
i got them replied fantine
at the same time she smiled
the candle illuminated her countenance
it was a bloody smile
a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips and she had a black hole in her mouth
the two teeth had been extracted
she sent the forty france to mont vermeil
after all it was a rise of the thenardier s to obtain money
cosette was not iii
fantine threw her mirror out of the window
she had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a patch to fasten it next the roof one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor and knocks you on the head every instant
the poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny only by bending over more and more
she had no longer and sarah which she fall fc her coverlet a mattress on the floor and as far less chair still remained
a little rose bush which she had had dried up forgotten in one corner
in the other corner was a butter pot to hold water which froze in winter and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice
she had lost her shame she lost her coquetry
a final sign
she went out with dirty caps
whether from lack of time or from indifference she no longer mended her linen
as the heels wore out she dragged her stockings down into her shoes
this was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles
she patched her bodice which was old and worn out with scraps of calico which tore at the slightest movement
the people to whom she was indebted made scenes and gave her no peace
she found them in the streets he found them again on her staircase
she passed many a night weeping and thinking
her eyes were very bright and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the left shoulder blade
she counted a great deal
she deeply hated father madeleine but made no complaint
she sewer seventeen hours away but a contractor for the work of prisons who made the prisoners work at a discount suddenly made prices fall which reduces the daily earnings of working women to june sous
seventeen hours of toil and nine sousa day
her creditors were more pitiless than ever
the second hand dealer who had taken back nearly all his furniture said to her incessantly when will you pay me you hussy
what did they want other good god
she felt that she was being hunted and something of the wild beast developed in her
about the same time thenardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once otherwise he would turn little cosette out of doors convalescent as she was from her heavy illness into the cold and the streets and that she might do what she liked with herself and die if she chose
a hundred francs thought fantine
but in what trade can one earn a hundred sousa day
come
said she le russell what is left
the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town
chapter xi christ is no sooner a fit what is this history of fantine
it is society purchasing a slave
from whom
from misery
from hunger cold isolation destitution
a dolorous bargain
a soul for a morsel of bread
misery offers society accepts
the sacred law of jesus christ governs our civilization but it does not as yet permeate if it is said that slavery has disappeared from european civilization
this is a mistake
it still exists but it weighs only upon the woman and it is called prostitution
it weighs up on the woman that is to say upon grace we aim was beauty maternity
at the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached nothing is left tocantins of that which she had formerly been
she has become marble in becoming more
who ever touched her feels cold
she passes she ensures you she ignores you she is the severe and dishonored figure
life and the social order have said their last word for her
all has happened to her that will happen to her
she has felt everything borne everything experienced everything suffered everything lost everything mourned everything
she is designed with that resignation which resembles indifference as death resembles sleep
she no longer avoids any thing
let all the clouds fall upon her and all the ocean sweep over her
what matters of toner
she is a sponge that is soaked
at least she believes it to be so but it is an error to imagine that fate can be exhausted and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever
alas
what are all these rates driven on pell help
whither are they going
why are they thus
he who knows that sees the whole of the shadow
he is alone
his name is god

felix thilo my fs had he remained in his own province and never be held paris would have been one of these men
if they were richer one would say they are candies if they were poorer one would say they are idlers
they are simply men without employment
among these unemployed there are bored the bored dreamers and some knaves
at that period as andy was composed of at all collar a big cravats watch with trinkets three beers of different colors worn one on top of the other the red and blue inside of a short waisted olive coat with acid fishtail a double row of silver buttons set close to eachother and running up to the shoulder and a pair of trousers of a light are made of olive ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite but always uneven number of lines varying from one to eleven a limit which was never exceeded
add to this high shoes with little irons on the heels at all hat with a narrow from hair worn in a gift an enormous cane and conversation set off by pinson potier
overall spurs and a mustache
at that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois and spurs the pedestrian
the provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches
it was the period of the conflict of the republics of south america with the king of spain of bolivar against morillo
narrow brimmed hats were royalist and were called morillo a liberal swore hats with wide brims which were called bolivars
this randy was smoking for he was decidedly fashionable
each time that the woman passed in front of him he bestowed on her together with a puff from his cigar some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful such as how ugly you are
will you get out of my sight
you have no teeth
sgc
etc
this gentleman was known as m
bama taboos
the woman a melancholy decorated spectre which went and came through the snow made him no reply did not even glance at him and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence and with a sombre regularity which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods
the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf and stifling his laugh bent down picked up a handful of snow from the pavement and thrust it abruptly into her back between her bare shoulders
the woman uttered a road whirled round have a leap like a panther and hurled herself upon the man burying her nails in his face with the most frightful words which could call from the guard room into the gutter
these insults poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy did indeed proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth
it was fantine
at the noise thus produced the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe passersby collected and a large and merry circle hooting and applauding was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman the man struggling his hat on the ground the woman striking out with feet and fists bareheaded howling minus hair and teeth logic with wrath horrible
suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd seized the woman by her satin bodice which was covered with mud and said to her follow me
the woman raised her head her furious voice suddenly died away
her eyes were glassy she turned pale instead of livid and she trembled with a quiver of terror
she had recognized javert
the dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape
chapter xiii the solution of some question d connected with the municipal police have et thrust aside the spectators broke the circle and set out with long strides towards the police station which is situated at the extremity of the square dragging the wretched woman after him
she yielded mechanically
neither he nor she uttered a word
the cloud of spectators followed meeting in a paroxysm of delight
supreme misery an occasion for obscenity
on arriving at the police station which was a low room warmed by active with a glazed and grated door opening on the street and guarded by a detachment is very opened the door entered with fantine and shut the door behind him to the great disappointment of the curious who raised themselves on tiptoe and cranes their necks in front of the thick glass of the station house in their effort to see
curiosity is a sort of gluttony
to see is to devour
on entering can find fell down in a corner motionless and mute crouching down like a terrified dog
the sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table
javert seated himself drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket and began to write
this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police
the latter do what they please punish them as seems good to them and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which they entitle their industry and their liberty
javert was impassive his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever
nevertheless he was seriously and deeply preoccupied
it was one of those moments when he was exercising without control but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience his redoubtable discretionary power
he was entering judgment
he judged and condemned
he summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind around the great thing which he was doing
the more he examined the deed of this woman the more shocked he felt
it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime
he had just be held yonder in the street society in the person of a free holder and an elector insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pairs
a prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen
he had seen that he javert
he wrote in silence
when he had finished he signed the paper holder it and said to the sergeant of the guard as he handed it to him take three men and conduct this creature to jail
then turning to fantine you are to have six months of it
the unhappy woman shuddered
six months
six months of prison
she exclaimed
six months in which to earn seven spy caddy
but what will become of rosette
my daughter
my daughter
but i still owe the the barriers over a hundred francs do you know that monsieur inspector
she dragged her self across the camp floor among the muddy boots of all those men without rising with clasped hands and taking great strides in her knees
monsieur javert said she i beseech your mercy
i assure you that i was not in the wrong
if you had seen the beginning you would have seen
i swear to you by the good god that i was not to blame
that gentleman the bourgeois whom i do not know put snow in my back
has anyone the right to put showdown our backs when we are walking along peaceably and doing no harm to anyone
i am rather ill as you see
you have no teeth
it was at that moment that he put the snow down my back
monsieur is very good monsieur inspector
is there got some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true
perhaps i did wrong to get angry
one gives way to vivacity and then when someone puts something cold down your back just when you are not exp a thing it
why did he go away
i would ask his pardon
ohmygod
it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon
come the favor today for this once monsieur javert
hold
ohmygod
i can not have her with me
what i do is so vile
oh my cosette
on my little angel of the holy virgin
what will become other poor creature
i will tell you it is the thenardier s innkeepers peasants and such people are unreasonable
they want money
you see there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get a long as best she may in the very heart of the winter and you must have pity on such a being my good monsieur javert
if she were older she might earn her living buy it can not be done at that are
i am not a bad woman at bottom
it is not coward lines sand gluttony that have made me what i am
if i have drunk brandy it was out of misery
i do not love it but i the numbs the senses
when i was happy it was only necessary to glance into my closets and it would have been evident that i was not a coquettish and untidy woman
i had linen a great deal of linen
have pity on me monsieur javert
she spoke thus rent in twain shaken with a one blinded with tears her neck bare wringing her hands and coughing with a dry short cough stammering softly with a voice of agony
great sorrow is a divine and terrible day which transfigured the unhappy
at that moment fantine had become beautiful once more
she would have softened a heart of granite but a heart of wood can not be softened
come
said javert i have heard you out
have you entirely finished
you will get six months
now march
the eternal father in person could do nothing more
at these solemn words the eternal father in person could do nothing more she understood that her fate was sealed
she sank down murmuring mercy
javert turned his back
the soldiers seized her by the arms
a few moments earlier a man had entered but no one had paid any need to him
at the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman who would not rise he emerged from the shadow and said one moment if you please
javert raised his eyes and recognized m
madeleine
he removed his hat and saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness excuse me md
mayor the words md
mayor produced a curious effect upon fantine
she rose to her feet with one bound like a spectre springing from the earth thrust aside the soldiers with both arms walked straight up to m
madeleine before anyone could prevent her and gazing intently at him with a bewildered air she cried at
so it is you who are m
lemaire
then she burst into a laugh and spit in his face
m
madeleine wiped his face and said inspector javert set this woman at liberty
javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad
he experienced at that moment blow upon blow and almost simultaneously the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life
on the other hand at the very bottom of his thought he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was and as to what this may it might be and then he with horror caught a glimpse of i know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack
but when he be held that may or that magistrate calmly wipe his face and saucer this woman at liberty he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement thought and word failed him equally the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case
he remained mute
the words had produced no less strange an effect on fantine
she raised her bare arm and clung to the damper of the stove like a person who is reeling
nevertheless she glanced about her and began to speak in a low voice as though talking to herself at liberty
i am to be allowed to go
i am not to go to prison for six months
who said that
it is not possible that anyone could have said that
i did not hear a right
it can not have been that monster of a major
await you my good monsieur javert who said that i was to be set free
oh see here
i will help you about it and you will let me go
that monster of a mayor that old black guard of a major is the cause of all
just in a fine monsieur javert he turned me out
all because of a lack of rascally women who gossip in the workroom
if that is not a horror what is
to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly
then i could no longer earn enough and all this misery followed
in the first place there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make and that is to prevent prison contractors from wronging poor people
i will explain it to you you see you are earning twelve sousa t shirt making the price falls to nine sold and it is not enough to live on
then one has to become whatever one can
as for me i had my little cosette and i was actually forced to become a bad woman
now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a major causes all the mischief
we women have but one silk dress for evening wear
you see that i did not do wrong deliberately truly monsieur have grand everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than i and who are much happier
o monsieur javert
it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free was it not
make inquiries speak to my landlord i am paying my rent now they will tell you that i am perfectly honest
zh
my god
i beg your pardon i have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove and it has made it smoke
m
madeleine listened to her with profound attention
while she was speaking hefty bird in his waistcoat drew out his purse and opened it
it was empty
he put it back in his pocket
he said to fantine how much did you say that you owed
ranting who was looking at javert only turned towards him was i speaking to you
then addressing the soldiers say you fellows did you see how i spit in his face
ah
i am afraid of monsieur javert
i am afraid of my good monsieur javert
so saying she turned to the inspector again and yet you see me
inspector it is necessary to be just
i understand that you are just me
and then you you come you are certainly obliged to preserve order you lead off the woman who is in the wrong but on reflection since you are a good man you say that i am to be set at liberty it is for the sake of the little one for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child
they may do whatever they please time now i will not stir
but today you see i cried because it hurt me
she laid her hand on the latch of the door
one step more and she would be in the street
javert up to that moment had remained erect motionless with his eyes fixed on the ground cash athwart this scene like some displaced statue which is waiting to be put away somewhere
the sound of the latch roused him
he raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level ferocious in the wild beast atrocious in the man of no estate
sergeant
who have you let her no
i said madeleine
had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any authority should have given such an order and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another without intending it
or in view of the enormities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours dodge way to himself that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolutions that it was indispensable that the small should be made great that the police dog should transform himself into a magistrate that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice and that in this prodigious extremity order law morality government society in its entirety was personified in him javert
however that maybe when m
madeleine uttered that word i as we have just heard police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the mayor pale gold with blue lips and a look of despair his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence and say to him with downcast eyes but a firm voice mr
mayor that can not be
why not
said m
madeleine
this miserable woman had insulted a citizen
inspector javert replied the mayor in a calm and conciliating to be listen
you are an honest man and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you
here is the true state of the case i was passing through the square just as you were leaving this woman away there were still groups of people standing about and i made inquiries and learned everything it was the towns man who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police
javert retorted this wretch has just insulted monsieur lemaire
that concern and said m
madeleine
my own insult belongs to me i think
i can do what i please about it
the insult is not to him but to the law
inspector javert replied m
madeleine the highest law is conscience
i have heard this woman i know what i am doing
and img
mayor do not know what i see
then content yourself with obeying
i am obeying my duty
my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison
m
madeleine replied gently used this well she will not serve a single day
at this decisive word javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say but in at one of voice that was still profoundly respectful i am sorry to oppose monsieur lemaire it is for the first time in my life but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my authority
icon find myself since monsieur lemaire desires it to the question of the gentleman
i was present
this woman flung herself on monsieur bama tab good who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony which forms the corner of the esplanade three stories high and entirely of cut stone
such things as there are in the world
in any case monsieur le maine this is a question of police regulations in the streets and concerns me and i shall retain this woman can fund
then m
use to find folded his arms and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto the matter to which you defer is one connected with the municipal police
according to the terms of articles nine eleven fifteen and sixty six of the code of criminal examination i am the judge
i order that this woman shall be set at liberty
javert ventured to make a final effort
but mr
mayor i refer you to article eighty one of the law of the hh of december in regard to arbitrary detention
monsieur lemaire permit me not another word
but leave the room said m
madeleine
javert received the bios erect fill in the face in his breast like a russian soldier
he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room
vantine stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed
nevertheless she also was the prey to a strange confusion
she had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers
she had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty her life her soul her child in combat before her very eyes one of these men was drawing her towards darkness the other was leaving her back towards the light
in this conflict viewed through the exaggerations of terror these two men had appeared to her like two giants the one spoke like her demon the other like her good angel
the angel had conquered the demon and strange to say that which made her studded from head to do it was the fact that this angel this liberator was the very man whom she abhorred that may or whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her word that madeleine
and at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion he had saved her
had she then been mistaken
just she change her whole soul
she did not know she trembled
she listened in bewilderment she looked on in affright and at every word uttered by m
madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her and some thong warm and ineffable indescribable which was both joy confidence and love dawn in her heart
when javert had taken his departure m
madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking i have heard you
i knew nothing about what you have mentioned
i believe that it is true and i feel that it is true
i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop
why did you not apply to me
but here i will pay your debts i will send for your child or you shall go to her
you shall live here in paris or where you please
i undertake the care of your child and yourself
you shall not work any longer if you do not like
i will give all the money you require
you shall be honest and happy once more
and listen
i declare to you that if all is as you say and i do not doubt if you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of god
oh
poor woman
this was more than fantine could bear
to have cosette
to leave this life of infamy
to live free rich happy respectable with cosette to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery
she stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her and could only give vent to two or three sons of
oh
oh
her limbs gave way beneath her she knelt in front of m
madeleine and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it
then she fainted
book sixth
javert chapter i the beginning of repose m
madeleine had fantine removed to that infirmary which he had ests blister in his own house
he confided her to the sisters who put her to bed
a burning fever had come on
she passed a part of the night in delirium and raving
at length however she fell asleep
on the morrow towards midday fantine awoke
she heard someone breathing close to her bed she drew aside the curtain and cash
madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head
his gaze was full of pity anguish and supplication
she followed its direction and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall
thenceforth m
he seemed to get to be clothed in light
he was absorbed in a sort of prayer
she gazed at him for a long time without eating to interrupt him
at last she said timidly what are you doing
m
madeleine had been there for an hour
he had been waiting for fantine to awake
he took her hand felt other pulse and replied how do you feel
well i have slept she replied i think that i am better it is nothing
he and erred responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it i was praying to the martyr there on high
and he added in his own mind for the martyr here below
m
madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries
he knew all now
he went on you have suffered much poor mother
oh
do not complain you now have the dowry of the elect
it is thus that men are transformed into angels
it is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise
you see this help from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven
it was necessary to begin there
he sighed deeply
but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking
that same night javert wrote a letter
the next morning be posted it himself at the office of m
shrm
it was addressed to paris and the superscription ran to monsieur chan phil let secretary of monsieur le prefer of police
m
madeleine made haste to write to the the barriers
fantine owed them one hundred and twenty france
he sent them three hundred francs telling them to pay themselves from that sum and to fetch the child instantly tom
chem
where her sick mother required her presence
this dazzled the barrier
the devil
this park is going to turn into a mulch cow
i see through it
women in my has taken a fancy to the mother
he replied with a very well drawn up bill for five hundred and some odd france
in this memorandum two undisputable items figured up over three hundred francs one for the doctor the other for the apothecary who had attended and physico ed eponine and a selma through two long illnesses
cosette as we have already said had not been ill
it was only a question of a trifling substitution of names
at the foot of the memorandum the barrier wrote received on account three hundred francs
m
madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more and wrote make haste to bring cosette
christi
in the meantime can find did not recover
she still remained in the infirmary
the sisters had at first only received and nursed that woman with repugnance
those who have seen the bas relief soft helms will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins
the ancient scorn of the best als for the ambu bajar is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion
bug in a few days fantine disarmed them
she said all kinds of humble and gentle things and the mother in her provoked tenderness
one day the sisters heard jerseys mid here ever i have been a sinner but when i have my child beside me it will be a sign that god has pardoned me
while i was leading a bad life i should not have liked to have my cosette with me i could not have borne her was astonished eyes
it was for her sake that i did evil and that is why god pardo name
i shall feel the bene diction of the good god when cosette is here
i shall gaze at her it will come good to see that innocent creature
she knows nothing at all
she is an angel you see my sisters
at that are the wings have not fallen off
m
madeleine went to see her twice a day and each time she asked him shall i see my cosette soon
he answered tomorrow perhaps
she may arrive at any moment
i am expecting her
oh
she said how happy i am going to be
we have just said that she did not recover her health
on the contrary her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week
that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder blades had he ought about a sudden suppression of perspiration as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last
m
madeleine said to the doctor well
has she got a child which she desires to see
said the doctor
yes
well
make haste and get it here
m
madeleine shuddered
fantine inquired what did the doctor say
j
madeleine forced himself to smile
he said that your child was to be brought speedily
that that would restore your health
oh
where joined he is right
but what do those thenardier a mean by keeping my cosette from me
oh
she is coming
atlas to behold happiness close beside me
in the meantime thenardier did not let go of the child and gave a hundred in sufficient reasons for it
cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter
and then there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood and they were collecting the bills for the jftc
ets
i shall send someone to fetch cosette
said father madeleine
if necessary i will go myself
you will be paid for all the little things
i have the honor to salute you with respect
fantine
in the meantime a serious incident occurred
carve as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it
chapter ii how jean may become champ one morning m
madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name
javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the police station and m
madeleine had not seen him
admit him he said
have reentered
m
madeleine had retained his sexy near the fire of high and his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations
he could not help thinking of poor fantine and it suited him to be glacial in his manner
javert he showed a respectful salute on the mayor whose back was turned to him
the mayor did not look at him but went on annotating this docket
kavery advanced two or three paces into the study and halted without breaking the silence
if any physiognomic t who had been familiar with javert and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization this singular composite of the roman the spartan the monk and the corporal this spy who was incapable of aloe this unspotted police agent if any physiognomic t had known his secret and long cherished a version form
madeleine his conflict with the mayor on the subject of fantine and had examined have that that moment he would have said to himself what has taken place
it was evident to anyone acquainted with that clear up right sincere honest austere and ferocious conscience that is very bad but just gone through some great interior struggle
javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance
like violent people in general he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion
his physio gnu my has never been more peculiar and startling
on entering he bowed to m
all the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared
that face as impenetrable and simple as granite no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression
his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency
at last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round
well
what is it
what is the matter javert
javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity which did not however preclude simplicity
this is the matter mr
mayor a culpable act has been committed
what act
an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect and in the gravest manner towards a magistrate
i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge as it is my duty to do
while the agent
asked m
madeleine
i said javert
you
i
and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent
young
mayor
m
madeleine same rest in his armchair
javert went on with a severe air and his eyes still cast down
mr
mayor i have come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me
m
madeleine opened his mouth in amazement
javert interrupted him you will say that i might have handed in my resignation but that does not suffice
i have failed in my duty i ought to be punished i must be turned out
and after a pause he added mr
mayor you were severe with me the other day and unjustly
be so today with justice
come now
why
exclaimed m
madeleine
what nonsense is this
what is the meaning of this
what culpable act have you been guilty of towards me
what have you done home
what are your wrongs with regard to me
you accuse yourself you wish to be superseded turned out said javert
turned out so it be then
that is well
i do not understand
you shall understand me
mayor
javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest and resumed still coldly and sadly md
may of six weeks ago in consequence of the scene over that woman i was furious and i informed against you
informed against me
at the prefecture of police in paris
m
madeleine who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than javert himself burst out laughing now as a major who had encroached on the province of the police
as an ex convict
the mayor turned livid
javert who had not raised his eyes went on i thought it was so
i had had an idea for a long time a resemblance inquiries which you had caused to be made a trade rolled the strength of your loins the adventure with old rauch elegant your skill in marksmanship your leg which you drag a little i hardly know what all absurdities
but at all events i took you for a certain jean valjean
a certain what did you say the name was
jean valjean
he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago when i was adjutant guard of convicts at foul on
on leaving the galleys this jean valjean as it appears ribbed a bishop then he committed another theft accompanied with violence on a public highway on the person of a little savoyard
he disappeared eight years ago no one knows how and he has been sought i fancied
in short i did this thing
wrath impelled me i denounced you at the prefecture
m
madeleine who had taken up the docket again several moments before this resumed with an air of perfect indifference and what reply did you receive
that i was mad
well
well they were right
it is lucky that you recognize the fact
i am forced to do so since the real jean valjean has been found
the sheet of paper which m
madeleine was holding dropped from his hand he raised his head based fixedly at javert and said with his indescribable accent am
javert continued this is the way it is mr
mayor
it seems that there was in the neighborhood near willy le haut clocher an old fellow who was called father champ mathieu
he was a very wretched creature
no one paid any attention to him
no one knows what such people subsist on
lately last autumn father champ mathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from well to matters theft had been committed a wall scaled branches of trees broken
my champ mathieu was arrested
he still had the branch of apple tree in his hand
the scamp is locked up
up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor
but here is where providence intervened
the jail being in a bad condition the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer champ mathieu to areas where the departmental prison is situated
in this prison at areas there is an ex convict named brevet who is detained for i know not what and who has been appointed turnkey of the house because of good behavior
mr
why i know that man
he is a favor
take a good look at me my goodman
you are jean valjean
you have been in the valleys of toulon it was twenty years ago we were there together
par bleu
you understand
the case is investigated
the things as well ventilated for me
this is what they discovered this champ mathieu had been thirty years ago a primer of trees in various localities notably at face rolled
the real or race of him was lost
a long time afterwards he was seen again in auvergne the non paris where he is said to have been a wheelwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress but that has not been proved
now before going to the galleys for theft what was jean valjean
apr uber of trees
where
at face rolled
another fact
he goes to auvergne
the local pronunciation turns jean into change is called shan mathieu
our man offers no opposition and he told him transformed into champ mathieu
you follow me do you not
inquiries were made at face rolled
the family of jean valjean is no longer there
it is not known where they have gone
you know that among those classes a family often disappears
search was made and nothing was found
when such people are not mud they are dust
and then as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back there is no longer anyone at face rolled who knew jean valjean
inquiries were made at toulon
besides brevet there are only two convicts in existence who have seen jean valjean they are cocks paille and chenile key and are sentenced for life
they are taken from the valleys and confronted with the pretense wchamp mathieu
they do not hesitate he is jean valjean for them as well as for brevet
the same and he is fifty four the same height the same air the same man in short it is he
it was precisely at this moment that i forwarded my denunciation to the prefecture in paris
i was told that i had lost my reason and that jean valjean is at areas in the power of the authorities
you can imagine whether this surprised me when i thought that i had that same jean valjean here
i write to the examining judge he sends for me champ mathieu is conducted to me well
interposed m
madeleine
javert replied his face incorruptible and as melancholy add verne
mayor the truth is the truth
i am sorry but that man is jean valjean
i recognized him also
m
madeleine resumed in a very low voice you are sure
javert began to laugh with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction
o
sure
he stood there thoughtfully for a moment mechanically taking pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table and he added and even now that i have seen the real jean valjean i do not see how i could have thought otherwise
i beg your pardon me
mayor
javert as he addressed these brave and supplicating words to the man who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station house and bade him leave the room javert that haughty man was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity m
madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question and what does this man say
ah
indeed mr
if he is jean valjean he has his previous conviction against him
to climb a wall to break a branch to purloin apples is a mischievous trick in a child for a man it is a misdemeanor for a convict it is a crime
robbing and housebreaking it is all these
it is no longer a question of correctional police it is a matter for the court of assizes
it is no longer a matter of a few days in prison it is the galleys for life
and then there is the affair with the little savoyard who will return i hope
the deuce
there is plenty to dispute in the matter is there not
yes for anyone but jean valjean
but jean valjean is as lyd og
that is the way i recognized him
any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him he would struggle he would cry out the kettle songs before the fire he would not be jean valjean etcetera
it
the rogue is clever
but it makes no difference
the prior were there
he has been recognized by four persons the kids camp will be condemned
the case has been taken to the assists at areas
i shall not here to give my testimony
i have been summoned
m
madeleine had turned to his desk again and taken up his docket and was turning over the leaves tranquilly reading and writing by turns like a busy man
he turned to javert that will do javert
in truth all these details interest me but little
we are wasting our time and we have pressing business on hand
javert you will be take yourself at once to the house of the woman bissau pied who sells herbs at the corner of the rue saint saul be
you will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre she and long
the man is a brute who came near crushing this woman and her child
he must be punished
you will then go to m
char cells true montes de champigny
he complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rainwater in his premises and is undermining the foundations of his house
but i am giving you a great deal of work
are you not to be absent
did you not tell me that you were going to a reason that matter in a week or ten days
sooner than that mr
mayor
on what day then
why i thought that i had said to monsieur lemaire that the case was to be tried tomorrow and that i am to set out by diligence tonight
m
madeleine made an imperceptible movement
and how long will the case last
one day at the most
the judgment will be pronounced tomorrow evening at latest
but i shall not wait for the sentence which is certain i shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken
that is well said m
madeleine
and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand
javert did not withdraw
excuse me md
mayor said he
what is it now
demanded m
madeleine
mr
mayor there is still something of which i must remind you
what is it
that i must be dismissed
m
madeleine rose
javert you are a man of honor and i esteem you
your daggers try our fault
moreover this is an offence which concerns me
javert you deserve promotion instead of degradation
i wish you to retain your post
javert gazed at m
madeleine with his candid eyes in whose depths his not very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible and said in a tranquil voice mr
mayor i can not grant you that
i repeat replied m
madeleine that the matter concerns me
but javert feeding his own thought only continued so far as exaggeration is concerned i am not exaggerating
this is the way i reason i have suspected you unjustly
that is nothing
it is our right to cherish suspicion although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse
but without proofs in a bit of rage with the object of dreaming my vengeance i have denounced you as a convict you a respectable man amator a magistrate
that is serious very serious
i have insulted authority in your person i am agent of the authorities
if one of my subordinates had done what i have done i should have declared him unworthy of the service and have expelled him
well
stop me
mayor one word more
i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others
that is just
i have done well
now if i were not severe towards myself all the justice that i have done would become injustice
ought i to spare myself more than others
no
what
i should be good for nothing but to chastise others and not myself
why i should be a blackguard
mr
mayor i do not desire that you should treat me kindly your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others
i want none of it for myself
the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen the police agent against the mayor the man who is down against the man who is up in the world is what i call false kindness
that is the sort of kindness which disorganized society
good god
it is very easy to be kind the difficulty lies in being just
come
if you had been what i thought you i should not have been kind to you go to
you would have seen
mr
mayor i must treat myself as i would treat any other man
so much the worse
come discharged cashiered expelled
that is well
i have arms
i will till the soil it makes no difference to me
mr
mayor the good of the service demands an example
i simply require the discharge of inspector javert
all this was uttered in a proud humble despairing yet convinced tone which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular honest man
we shall see said m
madeleine
and he offered him his hand
javert recoiled and said in a wild voice excuse me md
mayor but this must not be
a major does not offer his hand to a police spy
he added between his teeth a police dog yes from the moment when i have misused the police
i am no more than a police spy
then he bowed profoundly and directed his steps towards the door
there he wheeled round and with eyes still downcast mr
mayor he said i shall continue to serve until i am superseded
he withdrew
m
madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm surestep which died away on the pavement of the corridor
book seventh
the champ mathieu affair chapter i sisters implode the incidents the reader is afoot to peruse were not all known atm
shrm
but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory on that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details
among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances which we preserve out of respect for the truth
on the afternoon following the visitor is very m
madeleine went to see fantine according to his wont
the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary lazarus he ladies like all sisters of charity bore the names of sister per le tue and sisters implode
sister per pet he was an ordinary villagers sister of charity in a coarse style who had entered the service of god as one enters any other service
she was a nunes other women are cooks
this type is not so very rare
the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline
these rustic date utilised for the rough work of devotion
the transition from a driver to a carmelite is not in the least violent the one turns into the other without much effort the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand and places the good at once on the same footing as the monks little more amplitude in the clock and it becomes are ock
sister per pet he was a robust jun from marines near pontoise who chartered her patois drones grumbled sugared the option according to the bibl tty or the hypocrisy of the invalid treated her patients abruptly roughly was stabbed with the dying almost flung god in their faces stones their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rate was good honest and ruddy
sister simplices as white with a waxen pallor
beside sister per le tue she was the taper beside the candle
vincent depaul has divinely traced the features of the sister of charity in these admirable words in which he muggles as much freedom as servitude they shall have for their convent only the house of the sick for cell only a horse room for chapel only their parish church for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospitals for enclosure only obedience for gratings only the fear of god for veil only modesty
this idea i was realized in the living person or sister simplices he had never been young and it seemed as though she would never grow old
she was a person wed are not say a woman who was gentle austere well bred cold and who had never lied
she was so gentle that she appeared fragile but she was more solid than granite
she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine
there was so to speak silence in her speech she said just what was necessary and she possessed at one of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing room
this delicacy accommodated itself to the sergey own finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of row
let us emphasize one detail
she was almost renowned in the congregation for this in perth enable veracity
the anges i care speaks of sisters implode in a letter to the death item assisi
however pure and sincere we maybe we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little innocent pie
she did not
little lie innocent lie does such a thing exist
to lie is the absolute form of evil
to lie a little is not possible he who lies lies the whole lie
to lie is the very face of the demon
satan has two names he is called satan and lying
that is what she thought and as she thought so she did
the result was the whiteness which we have mentioned a whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance
her smile was white her glance was white
on entering the order of saint vincent de paul she had taken the name of simp life by special choice
snmp life of sicily as we know is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been both at syracuse alis which would have saved her
this patron saint suited this soup
sisters imp live on her entrance into the order had had two faults which she had gradually corrected she had a taste for dainties and she liked to receive letters
she never read anything but a book of prayers printed in latin in coarse type
she did not understand latin but she understood the book
this pious woman had conceived an affection for fantine probably feeling a latent virtue there and she has devoted herself almost exclusively to her care
m
madeleine took sister simplices part and recommended fantine to her in a singular tone which the sister recalled later on
on leaving the sister be approached fantine
fantine awaited m
she said to the sisters i only live when monsieur lemaire is here
she had a great deal of fever that day
as soon as she saw m
madeleine she asked him and cosette
he replied with a smile soon
m
madeleine was the same as usual with fantine
he urged everyone repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything
it was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre
but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him she is losing ground east
then he returned to the town hall and the clerk observed him attentively examining a roadmap of france which hung in his eturn
he wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil
chapter ii the perspicacity of masters cake claire from the town hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town to a fleming named masters caiff last french sc aug claire whole your horses and cabriolets as desired
in order to reach this as she claire the shortest way was to take the little frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which m
madeleine resided
the curse as it was said a worthy respectable and sensible man
at the moment when m
he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it then he paused again and stopped short as though in thought and after the lapse of a few seconds instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly be placed it gently and resumed his way with a sort of taste which had not been apparent previously
m
made prime found masters cake claire at home engaged in stitching a harness over
masters cake claire he inquired have you a good horse
mr
mayor said the fleming all my horses are good
what do you mean by a good horse
i mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day
the deuce
said the fleming
twenty leagues
yes
hitched to a cabriolet
yes
and how long can be rest at the end of his journey
he must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary
to traverse the same road
yes
the deuce
the deuce
and it is twenty leagues
m
madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled come figures
he showed it to the fleming
the figures were
you see he said total nineteen and a half as well say twenty leagues
mr
mayor returned the fleming i have just what you want
my little white horse you may have seen him pass occasionally he is a small beast from lower foul on nais
he is full office
they wanted to make a saddle horse of him at first
bah
he feared he kicked he laid everybody flat on the ground
he was thought to be vicious and no one knew what to do with him
i bought him
i harnessed him to a carriage
that is what he wanted slr he is as gentle as a girl he goes like the wind
ah
indeed he must not be mounted
it does not suit his ideas to be a saddle horse
everyone has his ambition
yes
carry
no
and he will accomplish the trip
your twenty leagues all at a full trot and in less than eight hours
but here are the conditions
state them
someone will be by
in the second place is the cabriolet for monsieur lemaire
yes
does monsieur lemaire know how to drive
yes
well monsieur lemaire will travel alone and without baggage in order not to overload the horse
agreed
but as monsieur lemaire will have no one with him he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen
that is understood
i am to have thirty francs a day
m
madeleine drew there napoleons from his purse and laid them on the table
here is the pay for two days in advance
fourthly for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy and would fatigue the horse
monsieur lemaire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that i own
i consent to that
it is light but it has no cover
that makes no difference to me
has monsieur lemaire reflected that we are in the middle of winter
m
madeleine did not reply
the fleming resumed that it is very cold
m
madeleine preserved silence
masters cake blaire continued that it may rain
m
of course monsieur lemaire replied scanf claire then scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumbnail he resumed with that careless air which the flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness but this is what i am thinking of how monsieur lemaire has not told me where he is going
where is monsieur lemaire going
he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question
said m
madeleine
yes monsieur lemaire
you must hold him in a little when going downhill
are there many dead ends between here and the place whither you are going
madeleine and he took his departure
the fleming remained utterly stupid as he himself said some time afterwards
the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again it was the mayor once more
he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air
monsieur sc aug claire said hear what sum to you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let tome the one bearing the other
the one dragging the other monsieur lemaire said the fleming with a broad smile
so be it
well
does monsieur le makes wish to purchase them orme
no but i wish to guarantee you in any case
you shall give me back the sum at my return
at what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet
five hundred francs monsieur lemaire
here it is
h
madeleine laid a bank bill on the table then left the room and this time he did not return
masters cake claire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a thousand francs
besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crowns
the fleming called his wife and related the affair to her
where the devil could monsieur lemaire be going
they held counsel together
he is going to paris said the wife
m
madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it and it lay on the chimney piece
the fleming picked it up and studied it
five six eight and a half
that must designate the posting relays
he turned to his wife i have found out
chat
it is five leagues from here to head in six from head into saint pol eight and a half from saint pol to areas
he is going to areas
meanwhile m
madeleine had returned home
he ascended to his room and there he shut himself up which was a very simple act since he liked to go to bed early
nevertheless the port tess of the factory who was at the same time m
i thought he had a rather singular air
this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m
towards midnight he woke up with a start in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head
he listened it was a footstep pacing back and forth as though someone were walking in the room above him
he listened more attentively and recognized m
this struck him as strange usually there was no noise in m
a moment later the cashier heard a noise which resembled that if a cupboard being opened and then shut again then a piece of furniture was disarranged then a pause ensued then the step began again
the cashier sat up in bed quite awake now and sharing and through his window panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direction of the rate it could only come from the window of m
the reflection wavered as though it came father from a fire which had been lighter than from a candle
the shadow of the window frame was not shown which indicated that the window was wide open
the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising
the cashier fell asleep again
an hour or two later he asked again
the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead
the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle
the window was still open
this is what had taken place in m
chapter iii a tempest in a skull the reader has no doubt already divined that m
madeleine is no other than jean valjean
we have already gazed into the depths of this conscience the moment has now come when we must take another look into it
we do so not without emotion and trepidation
there is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation
the eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than inman it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable more complicated more mysterious and more infinite
there is a spectacle more grand than the sea it is heaven there is a spectacle more grand than heaven it is the inmost recesses of the soul
to make the poem of the human conscience were it only with reference to a single man were it only in connection with the basest of men would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic
conscience is the chaos of chimeras of lists and of temptations the furnace of dreams the lake of ideas of which we are ashamed it is the pandemonium of sophos ms it is the battlefield of the passions
penetrate at certain hours past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection and look behind gaze into that soul gaze into that obscurity
there beneath that external silence battles of giants like those recorded in homer are in progress skirmishes of dragons and hydras and swarms of phantoms as in milton visionary circle was in dante
what a solemn thing is this infinity which every man hears within him and which he measures with despair against the captives of his brain and the actions of his life
alighieri one day met with a sinister looking door before which he hesitated
here is one before us up in whose threshold we hesitate
let us enter nevertheless
we have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had happened to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais
from that moment forth he was as we have seen a totally different man
what the bishop had wished to make of him that he carried out
it was more than a transformation it was a transfiguration
shrm
conceived the idea which we have mentioned accomplished what we have related succeeded in rendering himself save from seizure and inaccessible and thenceforth established atm
shrm
happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last he lived in peace reassured and hopeful having henceforth only two thoughts to conceal his name and to sanctify his life to escape men and to return to god
these two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed but a single one there both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest actions
in general they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life they turned him towards the gloom they rendered him kindly and simple they counselled him to the same things
sometimes however they conflicted
in that case as the reader will remember the man whom all the country of m
shrm
called m
madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second his security to his virtue
it seemed as we have already remarked as though he thought following the example of all those who have been wise holy and just that his first duty was not towards himself
at the same time it must be confessed nothing just like this has yet presented itself
never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating engaged in so serious a struggle
he understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by kavery when the latter entered his study
at the moment when that name which he had buried beneath so many layers was so strangely articulated he was struck with stupor and as though into fica tax with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny and through this stupid he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks
he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault
he felt shadows filled with thunders and lightnings descending upon his head
as he listened to javert the first thought which occurred to him was to go to run and denounce himself to take that champ mathieu out of prison and place himself there this was as painful and as poignant as an incision in the living flesh
then it passed away and he said to himself we will see
we will see
here pressed this first generous instinct and recoiled before heroism
we must render an account of the things which went on in this soup and we can only tell what there was there
he remained in this state during the rest of the day a whirlwind within a profound tranquillity without
he took no preservative measures as they may be called
everything was still confused and jostling together in his brain
his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly and he could have told nothing about himself except that he had received a great blow
he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to areas and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being as he was beyond the shadow of any suspicion there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged the tilbury from a cake claire in order to be prepared in any event
he dined with a good deal of appetite
on returning to his room he communed with himself
he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented that in the midst of his refer the rose from his chair moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door
be feared last something more should enter
he was barricading himself against possibilities
a moment later he extinguished hi slightly embarrassed him
it seemed to him as though he might be seen
by whom
alas
that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was stating him in the face his conscience
his conscience that is to say god
nevertheless he deliver himself at first he had a feeling of security and of solitude the bolt once drawn he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible
then he took possession of himself he set his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate in the dark
where do i stand
am not i dreaming
what have i heard
is it really true that i have seen that javert and that he spoke time in that magnet
who can that champ mathieu be
so he resembles me
is it possible
when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far from suspecting anything
what was i doing yesterday at this hour
what is there in this incident
what will the end be
what is to be done
this was the torment in which he found himself
his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them
nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof andre so i union
his head was burning
he went to the window and threw it wide open
there were no stars in the sky
he returned and seated himself at the table
the first hour passed in this manner
gradually however vague outlines began to take form and to fix themselves in his meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality not the whole situation but some of the details
he began by recognizing the fact that critical and extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it
this only caused an increase of his stupor
independently of the severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name
that which he had always feared most of all in his hours of self communion during his sleepless nights was to ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would be the end of all things for him that on the day when that name made its reappearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him and who knows
perhaps even his new soul within him also
he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible
assuredly if anyone had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would sing in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself would suddenly blaze forth above his head and that that name would not menace him that that light would but produce an obscurity more sense that this rent veil would but increase the mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this prodigious incident would have no other results of a gas he was concerned if so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored more peaceful and more respected than ever if anyone had told him that he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman
sell all this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact and god had permitted these wild fancies to become real things
hi are very continued to grow clearer
became more and more to an understanding of his position
it seemed to him that he had but just wakes up from some inexplicable dream and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very brink of the abyss
he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger am an unknown to him whom destiny had mistaken for him and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close once more it was necessary that someone himself or that other man should fall into it he had only let things take their course
the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that his place was empty in the valleys that do what he would it was still awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled it that this was inevitable and fatal and then he said to himself that at this moment he had a substitute that it appeared that a certain champ mathieu had that ill luck and that as regards himself being present in the valleys in the person of that champ mathieu present in society under the name of m
madeleine he had nothing more to fear provided that he did not prevent men from sealing over the head of that champ mathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the sepulchre falls once never to rise again
all this was so strange and so violent that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart which is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter
he hastily delighted his candle
well what then
he said to himself what am i afraid of
what is there in all that former i think about
i am save all is over
i had but one partly open door through which my last night invade my life and behold that door is walked up forever
that is very who has been annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me which had divined me good god
and which followed me every where that frightful hunting dog always making a point at me is thrown off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail henceforth he is satisfied he will leave me in peace he had his jean valjean
who knows
it is even probable that he will wish to leave town
and all this has been brought about without any aid from me and i count for nothing in it
ah
but where is the misfortune in this
upon my honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened to me
after all of it does bring harm to someone that is not my fault in the least it is providence which has done it all it is because it wishes it so to be evidently
have i the right to die arrange what it has arranged
what do i ask now
why should i medals
it does not concern me what
i am not satisfied but what more so i want
the goal to which i have aspired for so many years the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to heaven security i have now attained it is god who will sit i can do nothing against the will of god and why does god will it
in order that i may continue what i have begun that i may do good that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that it may be said at last that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which i have undergone and to that virtue to which i have returned
really i do not understand why i was afraid a little while ago to enter the house of that good cure and to ask his advice this is evidently what he would have said rome it is settled let things take their course let the good god do as he likes
thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience bending over what may be called his own abyss he rose from his chair and began to pave the rooms one said he let us think no more about it my resolve is taken
but he felt no joy
quite the reverse
one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore the sailor calls it the ride the guilty man calls it remorse for up heaves the soul as he does the ocean
after the expiration of a few moments do what he would be resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him think
as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago march on
before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation
it is certain that people do talk to themselves there is no living being who has not done it
the realities of the soil are nonetheless realities because they are not visible and palpable
so he asked himself where he stood
he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve
he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take their course to let the good god do as he liked was simply horrible to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silence to do nothing in short was to do everything
that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree
that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime
for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action
he spit it out with disgust
he continues to question himself
he asked himself severely what he had meant by this my object is attained
he declared to himself that his life really had an object but what object
to conceal his name
to receive the police
was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done
had he got another and a grand object which was the true one to save no this person but his soul to become honest and good once more to be a justman
was it not that above all that alone which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon him to shut the door on his last
but he was not shutting it
great god
he was reopening it by committing an infamous action
he was becoming a thief once more and the most odious of thieves
he was robbing another of his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine
he was becoming an assassin
he was murdering morally murdering a wretched man
he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death beneath the open sky which is called the galleys
on the other hand to surrender himself to save that may struck down with so melancholy an error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that help whence he had just emerged to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality
this must be done
he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penitence was wasted
there was no longer any need of saying what is the use
he felt that the bishop was there that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him that henceforth mayor madeleine with all his virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop be held his conscience
so he must go to areas deliver the false jean valjean and denounce the realone
alas
that was the greatest of sacrifices the most poignant of victories the last step to take but it must be done
sad fate
he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men
well said he let us decide upon this let us do our duty let us save this man
he uttered these words aloud without perceiving that he was speaking aloud
he took his books verified them and put them in order
he flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen
he drew from his secretary a pocket book which contained several banknotes and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections
anyone who had seen him during the execution of these various acts into which there entered such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him
only occasionally did his lips move at other times he raised his head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate
when he had finished the letter to m
laffitte he put it into his pocket together with the pocketbook and began his walk once more
hi are very had not swerved from its course
he continued to see his duty clearly written in luminous letters which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance go
tell your name
denounce yourself
in the same way he beheld as though they had passed before him invisible forms the two ideas which had up to that time formed the double rule of his soul the concealment of his name the sanctification of his life
for the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct and he perceived the distance which separates them
he recognized the fact that one of these ideas was necessarily good while the other might become bad that the first was self devotion and that the other was personality that the one said my neighbor and that the other said myself that one emanated from the light and the other from darkness
they were antagonistic
he saw them in conflict
in proportion as he meditated they grew before the eyes of his spirit
they had now attained colossal statutes and it seemed to him that he be held within himself in that infinity of which we were recently speaking in the midst of the darkness and the lights a goddess and a giant contending
he was filled with terror but it seemed to him that the good thought was getting the upper hand
he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that champ mathieu marked the second
after the grand crisis the grand test
but the federal layer for an instant gradually resumed possession of him
a thousand thoughts traversed his mind but they continued to fortify him in his resolution
one moment he said to himself that he was perhaps taking the matter too keenly that after all this champ mathieu was not interesting and that he had actually been guilty of theft
he answered himself if this man has indeed stolen a few apples that means a month in prison
it is a long way from that to the galleys
and who knows
did he steal
has it been proved
the name of jean valjean overwhelms him and seems to dispense with proofs
do not the attorneys for the crown always proceed in this manner
he is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict
in another instant the thought had occurred to him that when he denounced himself the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into consideration and his honest life for the last seven years and what he had done for the district and that they would have mercy on him
but this supposition vanished very quickly and he smiled bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forty sous from little gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction that this affair would certainly come up and according to the precise terms of the law would render him liable to penal servitude for life
he turned aside from all illusions detached himself more and more from earth and sought strength and consolation elsewhere
he told himself that he just do his duty that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it that if he allowed things to take their own course if he remained at m
shrm
his consideration his good name his good works the reference and veneration paid to him his charity his wealth his popularity his virtue would be seasoned with a crime
and what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing
while if he accomplished his sacrifice a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys the post the iron necklet the green cap unceasing toil and pitiless shame
at length he told himself that it must be so that his destiny was thus all other that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high that in any case he must make his choice virtue without and abomination within or holiness within and infamy without
the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail but his brain grow weary
he began to think of other things on in different matters in spite of himself
he was col the lighted a small fire it did not occur to him to close the window
in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck he finally succeeded in doing this
ah
yes he said to himself i had resolved to inform against myself
and then all of a sudden he thought of fantine
hold
said he and what about that poor woman
here a fresh crisis declared itself
fantine by appearing this abruptly in his revert produces the effect of an unexpected day of light it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect he exclaimed am
but i have hitherto considered no one but myself it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself to conceal my person or to save my soul to be a despicable and respected magistrate of an infamous and venerable convict it is kit is always land nothing but i but good god
all this is egotism these are diverse forms of egotism but it is egotism all the same
what if i were to think a little about others
the highest holiness is to think of others come let us examine the matter
the i excepted thrift faced the i forgotten what would be the result of all this
what if i denounce myself
i am arrested this champ mathieu is released i am put back in the valleys that is well and what then
what is going in here
ah
here is a country shown here are factories an industry workers both men and women aged grandsires children poor people
all this i have created all these i provide with their living everywhere where there is a smoking chimney it is i who have placed the brandon the hearth and meat in the pot i have created ease circulation credit before me there was nothing i have elevated vivified informed with life dec undated stimulated enriched the whole countryside lacking me the soul is lacking i take myself off everything dies and this woman who has suffered so much who possesses so many merits in spite of her call the cause of all whose misery i have unwittingly been
and that child whom i meant to go in search of whom i have promised to her mother doin it also owe something to this woman in reparation for the evil which i have done her
if i disappear what happens
the mother does the child becomes what it can that is what will take place if i denounce myself
if i do not denounce myself
come let us see how it will be if i do not denounce myself
after putting this question to himself he paused he seemed to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation but it did not last long and be answered himself calmly well this man is going to the galleys it is true but what the deuce
he has stolen
there is bliss in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft for he has
i remain here i go on in ten years i shall have made ten million si scatter them over the country i have nothing of my own what is that time
it is not for myself that i am doing it the prosperity of all goes on augmenting industries are aroused and animated factories and shops are multiplied families a hundred families a thousand families are happy the district becomes populated villages spring up where there were only farms before farm arise where there was nothing wretchedness disappears and with wretchedness debauchery prostitution theft murder all fixes disappear all crimes and this poor mother reads her child and behold a whole country rich and honest
ah
i was a fool
i was absurd
what was that i was saying about denouncing myself
i really must pay attention and not be precipitate about anything
what
because it would have pleased keno play the grand and generous this is melodrama after all because i should have thought of no one but myself the idea
for the sake of saving from a punishment a trifle exaggerated perhaps but just at bottom no one knows whom a thief a good for nothing evidently a whole countryside must perish
a poor woman must die in the hospital
a poor little girl must die in the street
like dogs at this is abominable
this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but means who is no doubt blue with cold at this moment in the den of those the barriers those peoples are rascals and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures and i was going off to denounce myself and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly
let us put it at the worst suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this and that my conscience will reproach me for it someday to accept for the good of others these reproaches which weigh only on myself this evil action which compromise x my soul alone in that lies self sacrifice in that alone there is virtue
he rose and resumed his march this time he seemed to be content
diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth truths are found only in the depths of thought
it seemed to him that after having descended into these depths after having long groped among the darkest of these shadows he had at last found one of these diamonds one of these truths and that he now held it in his hand and he was dazzle was he gazed upon it
yes he thought this is right i am on the right glad i have the solution i must end by holding easy to something my resolve is taken let things take their course let us no longer vacillate let us no longer hang back this is for the interest of all not for my own i am madeleine and madeleine i remain
woe to the man who is jean valjean
i am no longer be i do not know that man i no longer know anything it turns out that someone is jean valjean at the present moment let him lookout for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night if it halts and descends on ahead so much the worse for that head
he looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney piece and said hold
it has relieved me to come to a decision i am quite another man now
he proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short
come
he said i must not flinch before any of the consequences of the resolution which i have once adopted there are still threads which attach me to that jean valjean they must be broken in this very room there are objects which would betray me dumb things which would bear witness against me it is settled all these things just disappear
he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out a small key be inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the wallpaper a secret receptacle opened a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney piece in this hiding place there were so her and a blue linen blouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn cudgel show with iron at both ends
those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through din october could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit
he had preserved them as he had preserved the silver candlesticks in order to remind himself continually of his starting point but he had concealed all that came from the valleys and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen
he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it then with a quick and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without bestowing so much as a glance in the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years and flung them all tags cudgel knapsack into the fire
illustration candlesticks into the fire him to the fire be closed the false cupboard again and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary since it was now empty he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it
after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow
everything was on fire that horn surge i snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber
as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous days which it contained it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes
by bending over one could have readily recognized a coin no doubt the forty so i piece stolen from the little savoyard
he did not look at the fire but paced back and forth with the same step
all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone vaguely on the chimney piece through the glow
hold
he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them
they must be destroyed also
he seized the two candlesticks
there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal
he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment
he felt a sense of real comfort
how good warm this
said he
he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks
a minute more and they were both in the fire
at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting jean valjean
jean valjean
his hair rose upright he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing
finish
said the voice
complete what you are about
destroy these candlesticks
annihilate this souvenir
forget the bishop
forget everything
destroy this champ mathieu do
that is right
applaud yourself
so it is settled resolved fixed agreed here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him who has perhaps done nothing an innocent man whose whole misfortune life in your name upon whom your name weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who will be condemned who will finish his days in abject news and horror
that is good
be an honest man yourself remain monsieur lemaire remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent read the orphan live happy virtuous and admired and during this time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a man who will wear your red blouse who will hear your name in ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys
yes it is well arranged this
at wretch
the perspiration streamed from his brow
he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks
but that within him which had spoken has not finished
the voice continued jean valjean there will be around you many voices which will make a great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and only one which no one will hear and which will curse you in the dark
well
listen infamous man
all those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven and only the malediction will ascend to god
this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience has gradually become startling and formidable and he now heard it in his very far
it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking outside of him
he thought that he heard the last words so distinctly that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror
is there anyone here
he demanded a loud in utter bewilderment
then he resumed with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot how stupid i am
there can be no one
there was someone but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye can not see
he placed the candlesticks on the chimney piece
then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and a woke him with a start
this tramping to and frodo other and at the same time intoxicated him
it sometimes seems on supreme occasion was though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by chance of place
after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position
he nodded liked in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn
the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal
what a fatality
what conjunction that that champ mathieu should have been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which providence seemed to have employed at first to strengthen his position
there was a moment when he reflected on the future
denounce himself great god
deliver himself up
with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave all that he should be obliged to take up once more
he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good so pure so radiant to the respect of all to honor to liberty
he should never more stroll in the field she should never more hear the birds sing in the month or maybe should never more ve who walks on the little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house which he had built that little chamber
everything seemed charming to him at that moment
never again should be read those books nevermore should he wrote on that little table of white wolf his old port read the only servant whom he kept would never more bring him his coffee in the morning
great god
instead of that the convict gang the iron necklet the red waistcoat the chain on his ankle fatigue the cell the camp bed all those horrors which he knew sowell
at his age after having been what he was
if he were only young again
shrm
oh what misery
can destiny then be as malicious as an intelligent being and become as monstrous as the human heart
and do what he would he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his revert should be remain in paradise and become a demon
should be return to hell and become an angel
what was to be done
great god
what was to be done
the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained a fresh within him
his ideas began to grow confused once more they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair
the name of domain ville recurred incessantly to his mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past
he thought that domain ville was a little grove near paris where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april
he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly
he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone
at intervals as he combated his lassitude he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind
he tried to put to himself for the last time and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen prostrate with fatigue ought me to denounce himself
myth the to hold his peace
he could not manage to see anything distinctly
the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his medications quivered and vanished one after the other into smoke
he only felt that to whatever course of action he made up his mind something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness of the agony of his virtue
alas
all his resolution had again taken possession of him
he was no further advanced than at the beginning
thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish
eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sanctified and all the sufferings of humanity has also long thrust aside with his hand while the olive trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars
there he fell asleep and had a dream
this dream like the majority of dreams moreno relation to the situation except by its painful and heartrending character but it made an impression on him
this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on
it is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us
we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text
of whatever nature this dream may be the history of this night would be incomplete if we were to omit it it is the gloomy adventure or an ailing soul
here it is
on the envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i had that night
i was in a plain a vast gloomy plain where there was no grass
it did not seem to me to be daylight not yet night
i was walking with my brother the brother of my childish years the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hardly remember
we were conversing and we met some passersby
we were talking of a neighbor of our sin former days who had always worked with new window open from the time when she came to live on the street
as we talked we felt cold because of that open window
there were no trees in the plain
we saw a man passing close to us
he was entirely nude of the hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was earth color
the man had no hair we could see his skull and the veins on it
in his hand he held a switch which was as supplex sabine shoot and as heavy as iron
this horseman passed and said nothing to us
every thing was dirt colored even the sky
after proceeding a few paces i received no reply when i spoke i perceived that my brother was no longer with me
i entered a village which is spied
i reflected that it must be to mainville
why do mainville
the first street that i entered was deserted
i entered a second street
behind the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing erect against the wall
whereami
i saw the door of a house open and i entered
the first chamber was deserted
i entered the second
behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall
whereami
the house had a garden
i quitted the house and entered the garden
the garden was deserted
behind the first tree i found a man standing upright
where am j
i strolled into the village and perceived that it was a town
all the streets were deserted all the doors were open
not a single living being was passing in the streets walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens
but behind each angle of the walls behind each door behind each tree stood a silent man
only one was to be seen at a time
these men watched me pass
i left the town and began to ramble about the fields
after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me
i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town
they had strange heads
they did not seem to be in a hurry yet they walked faster than i did
they made no noise as they walked
in an instant this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me
the faces of these men were earthen in his
do you not know that you have been read this long time
he woke
he was icy cold
a wind which was still like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window which had been left open on their hinges
the fire was out
the candle was nearing its end
it was still blacknight
he rose he went to the window
there were no stars in the sky even yet
from his window they are of the house and the street were visible
a sharp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the earth
below him he perceived two red stars whose days lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness
as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold
said he there are no stars in the sky
they are on earth now
but this confusion vanished a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage
by the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle
it was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse
what vehicle is this
he said to himself
who is coming here so early in the morning
at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber
he shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice who is there
someone said i monsieur lemaire
he recognized the voice of the old woman who was his port ress
well
he replied what is it
what is that time
the cabriolet is here monsieur lemaire
what cabriolet
the tilbury
what tilbury
did not monsieur lemaire orders tilbury
no said he
the coachman says that he has come for monsieur lemaire
what coachman
m
m
scsu del aire
that name sent a shudder over him as though a flash or lightning had passed in front of his face
ah
yes he resumed m
sc aug claire
if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been frightened
a tolerably long silence ensued
he examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax which he rolled between his fingers
the old woman waited for him
she even ventured to uplift her voice once more what ami to say monsieur lemaire
say that it is well and that i am coming down
chapter v hindrances the posting service from areas tom
shrm
was still operated at this period by small mail wagons of the time of the empire
these mail wagons were two wheeled cabriolets upholstered inside with fawn colored leather hung in springs and having but two seats one for the post for the other for the traveller
the wheels were armed with those long offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance and which may still be seen on the road in germany
the despatch box an immense oblong coffee was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it
this coffee was painted black and the cabriolet yellow
these vehicles which have no counterparts nowadays had something distorted and hunchbacked about them and when one saw them passing in the distance and climbing up some road to the horizon they resembled the insects which are called i think termites and which though with but little cordele tv ran a great train behind them
but they travelled at a very rapid rate
shrm
that night the wagon which was descending tom
shrm
by the heading law collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the town with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse which was going in the opposite direction and in which there was but one person a man enveloped in a mantle
the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent stock
the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller paid no need and pursued his road at full gallop
that man is in a devilish hurry
said the postman
the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in bond up alone which are certainly deserving of pity
whither waste going
he could not have told
why was he hastening
he did not know
he was driving at random straight ahead
whither
to areas no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere as well
at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered
he plunged into the night as it to a gulf
something urged him forward something drew him on
no one could have told what was taking place within him everyone will understand it
what man is there who has not entered at least once in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown
however he had resolved on nothing decided nothing formed no plan done nothing
none of the actions of his conscience had been v sciekce
he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment
why waste going to areas
what an idea
that is very was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champ mathieu and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures that accordingly there was no danger
that it was no doubt a dark moment but that he should emerge from it that after all he held his destiny however bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it
he clung to this thought
at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to areas
nevertheless he was going thither
as he hesitated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that fine regular and event for which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour
in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something within him draw back
at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m
shrm
pay far behind him
the morning has its spectres as well as the evening
he did not see them but without his being aware of it and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul
each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people there within who are sleeping
the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road produced a gentle monotonous noise
these things are charming when one is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad
it was broad daylight when he arrived at head in
he halted in front of the inn to allow the horses breathing spell and to have him given some oats
the horse belonged ass cake claire had said to that small race of the boy long aid which has too much head too much belly and not enough neck and shoulders but which has a broad chest a large crupper thin fine legs and solid holds a homely but a robust and healthy face
the excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours and had not a drop of sweat on his loins
he did not get out of the tilbury
the stable man who brought the late suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel
are you going fat in this condition
said the man
he replied with a name of not having roused himself from his revert why
have you come from a great distance
went on the man
five leagues
ah
he sprang out of the tilbury
what is that you say my friend
i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway
just see here
the wheel really had suffered serious damage
the shock administered by the mail wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub so that the nut no longer held firm
my friend he said to the stable man is there a wheelwright here
certainly air
come the service to go and fetch him
he is only a step from here
hey
master four gaillard
master four gaillard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold
he came examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks a limb is broken
can you repair this wheel immediately
yes sir
when can i set out again
tomorrow
tomorrow
are you in a hurry air
in a very great hurry
i must set out again in an hour at the latest
impossible air
i will pay whatever you ask
impossible
well in two hours then
impossible today
two news poles and ayub must be made
monsieur will not be able to start before tomorrow morning
the matter can not wait until tomorrow
what if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it
how do
you are a wheelwright
certainly air
have you not a wheel that you can sell me
then i could start again at once
a spare wheel
yes
i have no wheeling and that would fit your cabriolet
two wheels make a pair
two wheels can not be put together haphazard
in that case sell me a pair of wheels
not all wheels for all sales air
try nevertheless
it is useless air
i have nothing to sell but cartwheels
we are but a poor country here
have you a cabriolet that you can let me have
the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle
he shrugged his shoulders
you treat the cabriolets that people let you sowell
if i had one i would not let it to you
well sell it to me then
i have none
what
not even a spring cart
i am not hard to please as you see
we live in a poor country
there is in truth added the wheelwright an old ca last under the shed yonder which belongs to a bourgeois of the town who gave it to me to take care of and who only uses it on the thirty sixth of the month never that is to say
i might let that to you for what matters it to me
but the bourgeois must not see it pass and then it is a cala shit would require two horses
i will take two post horses
where is monsieur going
to areas
and monsieur wishes to reach there today
yes of course
by taking two post horses
why not
certainly not
there is one thing to be said about that you see by taking post horses monsieur has his passport
yes
well by taking post horses monsieur can not reach areas before tomorrow
we are on a crossroad
the relays are badly served the horses are in the fields
the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from the post as well as elsewhere
monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay
and then they drive at a walk
there are many hills to ascend
come then i will go on horseback
in harness the cabriolet
someone can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood
without doubt
but will this horse bear the saddle
that is true you remind me of that he will not hear it
then but i can surely more a horse in the village
a horse to travel to areas at one stretch
usa
that would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts
you would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you
but you will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a thousand
what am i todo
the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and set out on your journey tomorrow
tomorrow will be too late
the deuce
is there not a mail wagon which runs to areas
when will it pass
tonight
both the post a pass at night the one going as well as the one coming
what
it will take you a day to mend this wheel
a day and a good long one
if you see two men to work
if i set ten men to work
what is the spikes were to be tied together with ropes
that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the belly is in a bad state top
is there anyone in this village who let four teams
no
is there another wheelwright
the stable man and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the head
no
he felt an immense joy
it was evident that providence was intervening
that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road
he had not yielded to this sort of first simmons he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season not fatigue nor by the expense he had nothing with which to reproach himself
if he went no further that was no fault of his
it did not concern him further
it was no longer his fault
it was not the act of his own conscience but the act of providence
he breathed again
it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart of its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him
it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifesting himself
he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had nothing to donut retrace his steps quietly
if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn it would have had no witnesses no one would have heard him things would have rested there and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse buy this conversation had taken place in the street
any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd
there are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators
while he was questioning the wheelwright some people who were pass jnr back and forth halted around them
after listening for a few minutes a young lad to whom no one had paid any need detached himself from the group and ran off
at the moment when the traveller after the inward deliberation which we have just described resolved to retrace his steps this child returned
he was accompanied by an old woman
monsieur said the woman my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet
these simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs
he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him ready to seize him once more
he answered yes my good woman lamin search of a cabriolet which i can hire
and he hastened to add but there is none in the place
certainly there is said the old woman
where
interpolated the wheelwright
at my house replied the old woman
he shuddered
the fatal hand had grasped him again
the old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring cart
the wheelwright and the stable man in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches interfered
it was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather things the rain came into it the wheels were rushed and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury a regular ramshackle old stage wagon the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc
etc
all this was true but this trap this ramshackle old vehicle this thing whatever it was canon its two wheels and would go to areas
he paid what was asked left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired intending to reclaim it on his return had the white horse put to the cart climbed into it and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning
at the moment when the cast moved off he admitted that he had felt a moment previously a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding
he examined this joy with a sort of wrath and found in absurd
why should be feel joy at turning back
after all he was taking this trip of his own free will
no one was forcing him to it
and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose
as he left need in he heard a voice shouting to him stop
shop
he halted the card with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope
monsieur said the latter it was i who got the cart for you
sell
you have not given me anything
he who have to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious
ah
said he you shall have nothing
he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed
he had lost a great deal of time at head in
he wanted to make it good
the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the month of february there had been gain the roads were bad
and then it was no longer the tilbury
the cart was very heavy and in addition there were many accents
he took nearly four hours to go from head into saint pol four hours for five leagues
at saint pol he had the horse in harnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable as he had promised a cake claire he stood beside the manner while the horse was eating he thought of sad and confusing things
does not monsieur wish to breakfast
come that is true i even have a good appetite
he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful face she led him to the public room where there were tabled covered with waxed cloth
make haste
said he i must start again i am in a hurry
a big flemish servant maid placed his knife and fork in all haste he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort
that is what aileen she thought i had not breakfasted
his breakfast was served he seized the bread took a mouthful and then slowly replaced it on the table and did not touch it again
a carter was eating at another table he said to this man why is their bread so bitter here
the carter was a german and did not understand him
he returned to the stable and remained near the horse
an hour later he had quitted saint poland was directing his course towards him ques which is only five leagues from areas
what did he do during this journey
of what was he thinking
as in the morning he watched the trees the thatched roofs the filled fields pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from thought
what is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time
to travel is to be born and to die are very instant perhaps in the vaguest region of his mind he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us the dark and bright intervals are intermingled after a dazzling moment an eclipse we looked has tense stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing each event is a turn in the road and all at once we are old we feel a shock all is black we distinguish an obscure door the gloomy horse of life which has been drawing us belts and we see a veiled and unknown person in harnessing amid the shadows
twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school be held this traveller entert in ques it is true that the days were still short he did not halt art in ques as he emerged from the village a laborer who was mending the road with stones raised his head and said to him that horse is very much fatigued
the poor beast was in fact going at a walk
are you going to areas
added the road mender
yes
if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early
he stopped his horse and asked the laborer how far is it from here to areas
nearly seven good leagues
how is that
the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter
ah
you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further
really
you will take the road on the left leading to c agency you will cross the river when you reach c amblin you will turn to the right that is the road to mont sainte lot which leads to areas
but it is night and i shall lose my way
you do not belong in these parts
no
and besides it is all crossroads stop
she resumed the road mender shall i give you a piece of advice
your horse is tired return to run quest here is a good inn there sleep there you can reach areas tomorrow
i must be there this evening
that is different but go to the inn all the same and get an extra horse the stable boy will guide you through the crossroads
still he felt that he had lost time
night had fully come
they turned into the crossroad the way became frightfully had the cart lurched from one but to the other he said to the postilion keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee
in one of the jolts the shuffle free broke
he replied have you a bit of rope and a knife
yes sir
he cut a branch from a tree and made a whiff letter of it
this caused another loss of twenty minutes but they set out against a gallop
the plain was gloomy low hanging black crisp dogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke there were whitish gleams in the clouds a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound on all quarters of the horizon as of someone moving furniture everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror
how many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night
he was stiff with cold he had eaten nothing since the night before he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trio in the vast plain in the neighborhood of weight years previously and it seemed but yesterday
the hours truck from a distant tower he asked the boy what time is in
the postilion whipped up the horses they had crossed the river and left mont sainte lot behind them
the night grew more profound
chapter vi sisters in plist put to the proof but at that moment fantine was joyous
she had passed a very bad night her cough was frightful here ever had doubled in intensity she had had dreams in the morning when the doctor paid his visits he was delirious he assumed an alarmed look and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m
madeleine arrived
all the morning she was melancholy said but little and laid plaits in her sheets murmuring the while in a low voice calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances
her eyes were hollow and sharing
they seemed almost extinguished at intervals then lighted up again and shone like stars
it seems as though at the approach of a certain darkhour the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth
each time that sisters implode asked her how she felt she replied invariably well
i should like to seek
madeleine
some months before this at the moment when fantine had just lost her last modesty her last shame and her last joy she was the shadow of herself now she was the spectre of herself
physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering
this creature office and twenty had a wrinkled brow flabby cheeks pinched nostrils teeth from which the fund had receded a leaden complexion agony neck prominent shoulder blades trail limbs a clayey skin and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray
slac
how illness improvised old age
at midday the physician returned have some directions inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary and shook his head
m
as exactness is kindness he was exact
about half past two fantine began to be restless
in the course of twenty minutes she asked them in more than ten times what time is it sister
at the third strike fantine say join beds he who could in general hardly turnover joined her yellow fleshless hands in a sort of convulsive clasp and the bug heard her utter one of those profound signs which seem to throw off rejection
then can tune turner and looked at the door
no one entered the door did not open
she remained this for a quarter of an hour her eyes riveted on the door motionless and apparently holding her breath
the sister dared not speak to her
the clock struck a quarter past three
f anyone fell back on her pillow
she said nothing but began to plait the sheets once more
half an hour passed then an hour no one came every time the clock struck fan time started up and looked towards the door then fell back again
her thought was clearly perceptible but she uttered noname she made no complaints he blamed no one
but she counted in a melancholy way
one would have said that something dark was descending upon her
she was livid and her lips were blue
she smiled now and then
then the sister heard here at very low and gently he is wrong not to come today since i am going away tomorrow
sisters implode herself was surprised at m
in the meantime fantine was staring at the tester of her bed
she seemed to be endeavoring to recall something
all at once she began to sign in a voice as feeble as a breath
thehun listener
this is what fantine was singing lovely things we will buy a sweet roll the faubourg s through
roses are pink cornflowers are blue i love my love cornflowers are blue
haste to the city buy linen buy a needle buy thread
dear holy virgin beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbons decker
god may give me his loveliest star i prefer the child thou hast granted me
make of it soiling not spoiling not a petticoat fair with its bodice fine which i will embroider and fill with flowers
this song was an old cradle romance with which she had in former days pulled her little cosette to sleep and which had never recurred to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child
she sang it in so sad a voice and to so sweet an air that it was enough to make anyone even a gundeep
the sister accustomed as she was to austerities felt a year spring to her eyes
the clock struck six
fantine did not seem to hear it
she no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her
sister simplic events serving maid to inquire of the port tess of the factory whether the mayor had return ec and if he would not come to the infirmary soon
the girl returned in a few minutes
fantine was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts
that when he went away he had been very gentle as usual and that he had merely told the port ress not to expect him that night
all at once she cried you are speaking of m
madeleine
why are you talking so low
what is he doing
why does he not come
her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man they wheeled found in affright
answer me
cried fantine
the servant stammered the port read told me that he could not come today
be calm my child said the sister lie down again
fantine without changing her attitude continued in a loud voice and with an accent that was both imperious and heartrending he can not come
why not
you know the reason
you are whispering it to each other there
i want to know it
sisters implode blushed faintly for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her
her flush did not last long the sister raised her calm sad eyes to fantine and said monsieur lemaire has gone away
fantine raised herself and crouched on her heels in the bed her eyes sparkled indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face
none
she cried he has gone to get cosette
then she raised her arms to heaven and her white face became ineffable her lips moved she was praying in a low voice
when her prayer was finished sister she said i am willing to lie down again i will do anything you wish i was naughty just now i beg your pardon for having spoken so loud it is very wrong to talk loudly i know that well my good sister but you see i am very happy the good god is good m
madeleine is good just think
he has gone to mont vermeil to get my little cosette
my child said the sister try to rest now and do not talk anymore
he set out this morning for paris in fact he need not even go through paris mont vermeil is a little to the left as you come thence
do you remember how he said to me yesterday when i spoke to him of cosette soon soon
he wants to give me a surprise you know
he made me signs letter so that she could be taken from the the barriers they can not say anything can they
they will give back cosette for they have been paid the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay
do not make signs to me that i must not talk sister
i am extremely happy i am doing well i am not ill at all anymore i am going to see cosette again i am even quite hungry it is nearly five years since i saw her last you can not imagine how much attached one gets to children and then she will be so pretty you will see
if you only knew what pretty little fish fingers she had
in the first place she will have very beautiful hands she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old like this
she must be a big girl now she is seven years old she is quite a young lady i call her cosette but her name is really eip tracie
shop
this morning i was looking at the dust on the chimney piece and i had a sort of idea come across me like that that i should see cosette again soon
mon dieu
one ought to reflect that life is not eternal
oh how good j
lemaire is to go
it is very cold
it is true he had on his cloak at least
he will be here tomorrow will be not
tomorrow will be a festival day tomorrow morning sister you must remind me to put on my little cap that has lace on it
what a place that mont vermeil is
i took that journey on foot once it was very long for me but the diligence ago very quickly
he will be here tomorrow with cosette how far is it from here to mony vermeil
the sister who had no idea of distances replied oh i think that he will be here tomorrow
tomorrow
tomorrow
said fantine i shall see cosette tomorrow
you are good sister of the good god that i am no longer illiam mad i could dance if anyone wished it
a person who had seen her a quarter of an hour previously would not have understood the changes he was all rosy now she spoke on a lively and natural voice her whole face was one smile now and then she talked she laughed softly the joy of a mother is almost infantile
well resumed the nun now that you are happy mind me and do not talk anymore
fantine laid her head on her pillow and said on a low voice yes lie down again be good for you are going to have your child sisters implode is right everyone here is right
and then without stirring without even moving her head she began to share all about her with wide open eyes and a joyous air and she said nothing more
the sister drew the curtains together again hoping that she would fall into a dose
she said to him she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed will she not sit
the doctor thought that she was delirious
she added see
there is just room
the doctor took sister simplices side and she explained matters to him that h
madeleine was absent for a day or two and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to undeceive the invalid who believed that the mayor had gone to mont vermeil that it was possible after all that her guess was correct the doctor approved
give me your hand said the doctor
she stretched out her arm and exclaimed with a laugh at hold
in truth you did not know if i am cured cosette will arrive tomorrow
the doctor was surprised she was better the pressure on her chest had decreased her pulse had regained its strengths sort of life had suddenly super genes and reanimated this poor worn out creature
doctors he went on did the sister tell you that m
lemaire has gone to get that more of a child
the doctor recommended silence and that all painful emotions should be avoided be prescribed an infusion of pure chin china and in case the fever should increase again during the night a calming potion
as he took his departure he said to the sisters he is doing better in good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive tomorrow with the child who knows
there are crises do astounding great joy has been known to arrest maladies i know well that this is an organic disease and in an advanced state but all those things are such mysteries we may be able to save her
the landlady of the hotel entered
does monsieur wish aged
does monsieur requires upper
he made a sign of the head in the negative
here he broke his silence
will not the horse be in a condition to set out again tomorrow morning
oh monsieur
he must rest for two days at least
he inquired is not the posting station located here
yes sir
the hostess conducted him to the office he showed his passport and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night tom
shrm
by the mail wagon the seat beside the post boy chanced to be vacant he engaged it and paid for it
this done he left the hotel and began to wander about the town
he was not acquainted with a eras the streets were dark and he walked on at random but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passersby
he crossed the little river crunch on and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way
a citizen was passing along with a lantern
after some hesitation he decided to apply to this man not without having first glanced behind and in front of him as though he feared lest someone should hear the question which he was about to put
monsieur said he where is the courthouse if you please
you do not belong in towns or
replied the bourgeois who was a bold ishman well follow me
i happen to be going in the direction of the courthouse that is to say in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture for the courthouse is undergoing repairs just at this moment and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally in the prefecture
i sit there that these sizes are held
he asked
m
it is in this grand hall that the court is held
on the way the bourgeois said to him if monsieur de sites to witness a case it is rather late
when they arrived on the grand square however the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up in the front of a vast and gloomy building
upon my words if you are in luck you have arrived in season
do you see those four windows
that is the court of assizes
there is light there so they are not through
the matter must have been greatly protracted and they are holding an evening session
do you take an interest in this affair
is of a criminal case
are you a witness
he replied i have not come on any business i only wish to speak to one of the lawyers
that is different said the bourgeois
stop sit here is the door where the sentry stands
you have only to ascend the grand staircase
it is always a heartbreaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black murmuring together on low voices on the threshold of the halls of justice
it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words
condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result
all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observed so many sombre gives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices
this spacious hall illuminated by a single lamp was the old hall of the episcopal palace and served as the large hall of the palace of justice
a double leaves door which was closed at that moment separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting
the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he met
what stage have they reached air
he asked
it is finished said the lawyer
finished
this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round
excuse me sir perhaps you are a relative
no i know no one here
has judgment been pronounced
of course
nothing else was possible
to penal servitude
for life
he continued in a voice so weak that it was barely audible then his identity was established
what identity
replied the lawyer
there was no identity to be established
the matter was very simple
the woman had murdered her child the infanticide was proved the jury three out the question of premeditation and she was condemned for life
so it was a woman
said he
why certainly
the limos in woman
of what are you speaking
nothing
but since it is all over how come fit that the hall is still lighted
for another case which was begun about two hours ago
what other case
oh
this one is a clear case also
it is about a sort of blackguards man arrested for a second offence a convict who has been guilty of the bt
is there any way of getting into the courtroom air
said he
i really think that there is not
there is a great crowd
however the hearing has been suspended
some people have gone out and when the hearing is resumed you might make an effort
where is the entrance
through yonder large door
the lawyer left him
in the course of a few moments he had experienced almost simultaneously almost intermingled with each other all possible emotions
the words of this in different spectator had in turn pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire
when he saw that nothing was settled he breathed freely once more but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure
he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying
the docket of the session was very heavy the president had appointed for the same day two shortages in los cases
they had begun with the infanticide and now they had reached the convict the old offender the return horse
this man had stolen apples but that did not appear to be entirely proved what had been proved was that he had already been in the galleys at toulon
it was that which lent a bad aspect to his case
the man would probably be condemned the attorney general was very clever and never missed his culprits he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses
an usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the ad sizes
he inquired of this usher will the door be opened sponsor
it will not be opened at all replied the usher
what
it will not be opened when the hearing is resumed
is not the hearing suspended
the heating has just been begun again replied the usher but the door will not be opened again
why
because the hall is full
what
there is not room for one more
not another one
the door is closed
no one can enter now
the usher added after a pause there are to tell the truth two or three extra places behind monsieur le president but monsieur le president only admits public functionaries to them
so saying the usher turned his back
he retired with bowed head traversed the antechamber and slowly descended the stairs as though hesitating at every step
it is probable that he was holding counsel with himself
the violent conflict which had been going on within him since the pre sexing evening was not yet ended and every moment he encountered some new phase of it
on reaching the landing place he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms
all at once he opened his so andrew out his pocket book took from its pencil tore out a leaf and upon that lead he wrote rapidly by the light of the street lantern this line m
madeleine mayor of m
shrm
then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides made his way through the crowd walked straight up to the usher handed him the paper and said in an authoritative manner take this to monsieur le president
the usher took the paper cast a glance upon it and obeyed
chapter viii an entrance by favor although he did not suspect the fact the mayor of n
wurm
enjoyed a sort of celebrity
for the space of seven years his reputation for virtue had filled the whole of bad boy lonna is it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments
besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town by resuscitating the black jet industry there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of m
euro
which was not indebted to him for some benefit
he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries or other arrondissements
it was thus that he had when occasion offered supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne the flax spinning industry at fervent and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at gougers sure anche
everywhere the name of m
madeleine was pronounced with generation
serac and douai envied the happy little town of m
shrm
its major
the councillor of the royal court of douai who was presiding over this session of the assizes at areas was acquainted in common with the rest of the world with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored
the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hell in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him
in the midst of his revert he heard someone saying to him will monsieur done the honor to follow me
it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously and who was now bowing to the earth before him
at the same time the usher handed him the paper
he unfolded it and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it
the president of the court of assizes presents his respects tom
madeleine
he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste
he followed the usher
a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of rain stored cabinet of severe aspect lighted by two wax candles placed upon a table with a green cloth
these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed
the us hee had left him alone
the supreme moment had arrived
he sought to collect his faculties but could not
it is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life that the threads of thought snap within the brain
he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned
with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where so many lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his name and which his fate was at that moment traversing
he stared at the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be me
he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the jolts of the cart but he was not conscious of it
it seemed to him that he felt nothing
he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicola apache mayor of paris and minister and dated through an error no doubt they got june of the year ii
and in which pac be forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them
any spectator who had chances to see him at that moment and who had watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and her early two or three times
he read it without paying any attention to it and unconsciously
he was thinking of fan time and cosette
as he dreamed he turns around and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes
he had almost forgotten that door
his glance calm at first paused there remained fixed on that brass handle then grew terrified and little by little became impregnated with fear
beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples
at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which does so well convey larrieu
who compels me to this
then he wheeled briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him went to it opened it and passed out
he was no longer in that chamber he was outside in a corridor along narrow corridor broken by steps and gratings making all sorts of angles lighted here and thereby lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids the corridor through which he had approached
he breathed be listened not a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as though pursued
when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listened
the same silence reigned and there was the same darkness around him
he was out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall
the stone was sold the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow he straightened himself up with a shiver
then there alone in the darkness trembling with cold and with something else too perchance he hesitated
he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard within him but one voice which said alas
a quarter of an hour passed this
at length he bowed his head signed with agony dropped his arms and retraced his steps
he walked slowly and as though crushed
it seemed as though someone had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back
here entered the council chamber
the first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door
this knob which was round and of polished brass shone like a terrible star for him
he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger
he could not take his eyes from it
from time to time he advanced a step and approached the door
had he listened he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur but he did not listen and he did not hear
suddenly without himself knowing how it happened he found himself near the door he grasped the knob convulsively the door opened
he was in the courtroom
chapter is a place where convictions are in process of formation he advanced space closed the door mechanically behind him and remained standing contemplating what he saw
it was a vast and badly lighted apartment now full of uproar now full of silence where all the apparatus of a criminal case with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng was in process of development
at the one end of them all the one where he was were judged with abstracted air in threadbare robes who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids at the other end a ragged crowd lawyers in all sorts of attitudes soldiers with hard but honest faces ancient spotted woodwork a dirty ceiling tables covered with serve that was yellow rather than green doors blackened by hand marks tap room lamps which emitted more smoke than light suspended from nails in the wainscot on the tables candles in brass candle sticks darkness ugliness sadness and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law and that grand divine thing which is called justice
this man was the man
he did not seek him he saw him his eyes went th other naturally as though they had known beforehand where that figure was
get your ht he was looking at himself grown old not absolutely the same in face of course but exactly similar in attitude and aspect with his bristling hair with that wild and uneasy eye with that blouse just as it was on the day when he entered d full of hatred concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison
he said to himself with a shudder good god
shall i become like that again
this creature seemed to be at least sixty there was something indescribably coarse stupid and frightened about him
at the sound made by the opening door people had drawn aside to make way for him the president has turned his head and understanding that the person age who had just entered was the mayor of m
shrm
he had vowed to him the attorney general who had seen m
madeleine atm
shrm
whither the duties of his office had called him more than once recognised him and saluted him also he had hardly perceived it he was the victim of a sort of hall if i nation he was watching
judges clerks gendarmes a throng of cruelly curious heads all these he had already be held once in days gone by twenty seven isard before he had encountered those fatal things once more there they were they moved they existed it was no longer an effort of his memory ami rate of his thought they were real gendarmes and real judges a real crowd and real men of flesh and blood it was all over me be held the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him with all that there is formidable in reality
all this was yawning before him
he was horrified by it be shut his eyes and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul never
and by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble and rendered him nearly had it was another self of his that was there
aol called that man who was being tried jean valjean
under his very eyes unheard of vision he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life enacted by his spectre
m
bama taboos was one of the jurors
the attention of all was excited to the highest pitch the affair had lasted for three hours for three hours that crowd had been watch ing a strange man a miserable specimen of humanity either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness
this jan as the reader already knows was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apples broken in the orchard or a neighbor called the power on orchard
who was this man
an examination had been made witnesses had been heard and they were unanimous light had a bounded throughout the entire web see the accusation said we have in our grasp not only a marauder a cheaper of fruit we have here in our hands a bandit an old offender who has broken his banamex convicts miscreant of the most dangerous description a male factor named jean valjean whom justice has long been in search of and who eight years ago on emerging from the galleys at toulon committed a highway robbery accompanied by violence on the person of a child a savoyard named little gervais a crime provided for by article of the penal code the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter when his identity shall have been judicially established
he has just committed a fresh theft it is a case of a second offence condemn him for the fresh deed later on he will be judged for the old crime
in the face of this accusation in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else he made sign x and gestures which were meant to convey no or else he stared at the ceiling he spoke with difficulty replied with embarrassment but his whole person from head to do it was a denial he was an idiot in the presence of all these kinds ranged in order of battle around him and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him nevertheless it was a question of the most menacing future for him the likeness increased every moment and the entire crowd surveyed with more anxiety than he did himself that sentence freighted with calamity which descended ever closer over his head there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded besides the galleys a possible death penalty in case his identity were established and the affair of little gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation
who was this man
what was the nature of his apathy
was it imbecility or draft
did he understand too sell or did he hit understand shall
these were questions which divides the crowd and seemed to divide the jury there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case the drama was not only melancholy it was also obscura
the counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well in that provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar and which was formerly employed by all advocates at paris as well as at romorantin or at mont brison and which today having become classic is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy to whom it is suites on account or its grave sonorous news and its majestic strides tongue in which a husband is called a consort and a woman a spouse paris the centre of art and civilisation the king the monarch monseigneur the bishops sainted pontiff the district attorney the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution the arguments the accents which we have just listened to the age of louis xiv
the grand area theatre the temple of melpomene the reigning family the august blood of our kings a concerts musical solemnity the general commandant of the province the illustrious warrior who etc
the pupils in the seminary the set enderle cities errors imputed to newspapers the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs etc
the lawyer had accord ingly begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apples an awkward matter couched in fine style but benign e bossuet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion
the lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantial it proved
his client whom he in his character of counsel persisted in calling champ mathieu had not been seen scaling that wall not breaking that branch by anyone
he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer preferred to call about him his possession but he said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground and had picked it up
where was there any proof to the contrary
no doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall then thrown away by the alarmed marauder there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case
but what proof was there that that thief has been champ mathieu
one thing only
his character as an ex convict
the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be unhappily well attested the accused had resided at face rolled the accused had exercised the calling of a tree pruner there the name of champ mathieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu all that was true in short four witnesses recognize champ mathieu positively and without me sit at lines that convict jean valjean to these signs to this testimony the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client the denial of an interested party but supposing the h he was the convict jean valjean did that prove that he was the thief of the apples
that was a presumption at the most not a proof
the prisoner it was true and his counsel in good faith was obliged to admit it had adopted a bad system of defence
he obstinately denied everything the theft and his character of conduct
an admission upon this last point would certainly have been better and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges the counsel had advised him to do this but the accused had obstinately refused thinking no doubt that he would save everything by admitting nothing
it was an error but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration
this man was visibly stupid
long continued wretchedness in the galleys longniddry outside the galleys had brutalized him etc
he defended himself badly was that a reason for condemning him
as for the affair with little gervais the counsel need not discuss it it did not enter into the case
the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court of the identity of jean valjean appeared to them to be evident to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his bag and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence
the district attorney answered the counsel for the defence
he was violent and floridas district attorneys usually are
he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty
he reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer
the advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was jean valjean
he took note of this
so this man was jean valjean
this point had been conceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed
here by means of a clever autonomas ia which went back to the sources and causes of crime the district attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school then dawning under the name of the satanic school which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the quotidienne and their if lamm the attributed not without some probability to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of champ mathieu or rather to speak more correctly of jean valjean
having exhausted these considerations he passed onto jean valjean himself
who was this jean valjean
description of jean valjean a monster spewed forth etc
the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of the game ne which is not useful to tragedy but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence
the audience and the jury shuddered
the description finished the district attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day and it is such a man etc
etc
etc
vagabond beggar without means of existence etc
erc
uniref by his past life to culpable deeds and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys as was proved by the crime committed against little gervais etc
etc
it is such a man can but upon the highway in the very act of theft a few paces from a wall that had been scaled still holding in his hand the object stolen who denies the crime the theft the climbing the wall series everything denied even his own identity
in addition to a hundred other proofs to which we will not recur four witnesses recognize him javert the upright inspector of police javert and three of his former companions in infamy the convicts brevet chen il dish and coche paille
what does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity
his denial
what obduracy
you will do justice gentlemen of the jury etc
etc
while the district attorney was speaking the accused listened to him open mouthed with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assuredly blended
he was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that
two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice that is what comes of not having asked m
gallup
the district attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude evidently deliberate which denotes not imbecility but craft skills habit of receiving justice and which set forth in all its nakedness the profound perversity of this man
he ended by making his reserves on the affair of little gervais and demanding a severe sentence
at that time as the reader will remember it was penal servitude for life
chapters the system of denials the moment for closing the debate had arrived
the president had the accused stand up and addressed to him the customary question have you anything to add to your defence
the man did not appear to understand as he stood there twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had
the president repeated the question
this time the man heard it
he seemed to understand
he made a motion like a man who is just waking up cast his eyes about him stared at the audience the gendarmes his counsel the jury the court laid his monstrous fist on the rim of wood work in front of his bench took another look and allah once fixing his glance upon the district attorney he began to speak
it was like an eruption
it seemed from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth incoherent impetuous pell help tumbling over each other as though they were all pressing forward to issue for that once
he said this is what i have to say
that i have been a wheelwright in paris and that it was with monsieur ball up
it is a hard trade
handling iron when there is ice between the paving stones is hard work
that wears a man out quickly
one is old while he is still quite young in that trade
at forty a man is done for
i was fifty three
i was in a bad state
and then work men are some am
when a man is no longer young they call him nothing but an old bird old beast
i was not earning more than thirty sousa day
they paid me as little as possible
the masters took advantage of my age and then i had my daughter who was a laundress at the river
she earned a little also
it suffices for us two
she had trouble also all day long up to her waist in a tub in rain in snow
when the wind cuts your face when it freezes it is all the same you must still wash
there are people who have not much linen and wait until late if you do not wash you lose your custom
the planks are badly joined and water drops on you from everywhere you have your petticoats all damp above and below
that penetrates
she has also worked at the laundry of the enfants routes where the water comes through faucets
you are not in the tub there you wash at the faucet in front of you and rinse in a basin behind you
as it is enclosed you are not so cold but there is that hot steam which is terrible and which ruins your eyes
her husband heather
she is dead
we have not been very happy
she was a good girl who did not go to the ball and who was very peaceable
there i am telling the truth you have only to ask
ah yes
how stupid i am
paris is a gulf
who knows father champ mathieu there
but m
gallup rossi tell you
rose farm
the man ceased speaking and remained standing
he had said these things in cloud rapid hoarse voice with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuousness
once he paused to salute someone in the crowd
the sort of affirmations which he seemed to flung out before him at random came like bid counts and to each he added the gesture of a woodcutter whole splitting wood
when he had finished the audience burst into a laugh
he stared at the public and perceiving that they were laughing and not understanding why he began to laugh himself
it was inauspicious
the president an attentive and benevolent man raised his voice
he reminded the gentlemen of the jury that the queue ball up for her in a master wheelwright with whom the accused stated that he had served had been summoned in vain
he had become bankrupt and was not to be found
then turning to the accused been joined him to listen to what he was about today and added you are in a position where reflection is necessary
the gravest presumptions rest upon you and may induce vital results
prisoner in your own interests i summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points
in the first place did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard break the branch and steal the apples that is to say commit the crime of breaking in and theft
in the second place are you the discharged convict jean valjean yes or no
the prisoner shook his head with a capable air like a man who has thoroughly understood and who knows what answer he is going to make
he opened his mouth turned towards the president and said in the first place then he stared at his cap stared at the ceiling and held his peace
prisoner said the district attorney in a severe voice pay attention
you are not answering anything that has been asked if you
your embarrassment condemns you
it is evident that your name is not champ mathieu that you are the convict jean valjean concealed first under the name of kean kay h leu which was the name of his mother that you sent to auvergne that you were born arcade rolled where you were a primer of trees
it is evident that you have been guilty of entering and of the theft of ripe apples from the pierron orchard
the gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion
illustration father champ mathieu on trial the prisoner had finally resumed his seat he arose abruptly when the district attorney had finished and exclaimed you are very wicked that you are
this what i wanted to say i could not find words for it at first
i have stolen nothing
i am a man who does not have something to eat every day
i was coming from silly i was walking through the country after a shower which had made the whole country yellow even the lines were overflowed and nothing sprang from the sand anymore but the little blades of grass at the wayside
i found a broken branch with apples on the ground i picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble
i have got stolen i picked up from the ground things that were lying there
you say jean valjean jean mathieu
i worked form
i think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways i know nothing different
when i was a child they called me young fellow now they call me old fellow those are my baptismal games game that as you like
i have been in auvergne i have been arcade rolled
page i
well
i tell you that i have not stolen and that i am father champ mathieu i have been with m
gallup i have had a settled residence
you worry me with your nonsense there
why is everybody pursuing me so furiously
the district attorney had remained standing be addressed the president monsieur le president in view of the confused but exceedingly clever denials of the prison dr who would like to pass himself off as an idiot but who will not succeed in so doing we shall attend to that we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this place the convicts brevet coche paille and chen il dish and police inspector javert and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict jean valjean
i would remind the district attorney said the president that police inspector javert recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement left the courtroom and the town as soon as he had made his deposition we have afforded him permission with the consent of the district attorney and of the counsel for the prisoner
that is true mr
president responded the district attorney
in the absence of sieur javert i think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago
javert is an estimable man who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions
i recognize him perfectly
the name of this man is not champ mathieu he is a new convict named jean valjean and is very vicious and much to be feared
it is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term
he underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for theft
he made five or six attempts to escape
besides the theft from little gervais and from the pierron orchard i suspect him of a theft committed in the house of his grace the late bishop of di often saw him at the time when i was adjutant of the valley guard at the prison in toulon
i repeat that i recognize him perfectly
the district attorney concluded by insisting that in default of javert the three witnesses brevet chen il dish and coche paille should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated
the usher accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance introduced the convict brevet
the audience was in suspense and all breasts headed as though they had contained but one soul
the ex convict brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons
the two sometimes go together
in prison whither fresh misdeeds had led him he had become something in the nature of a turnkey
he was a man of whom his superiors said he tries to make himself of use
the chaplain shore good testimony as to his religious habits
it must not be forgotten that this passed under the restoration
brevet said the president you have undergone an ignominious sentence and you can not take an oath
brevet dropped his eyes
nevertheless continued the president even in the man whom the law has degraded there may remain when the divine mercy permits it a sentiment of honor and of equity
it is to this sentiment that i appeal at this decisive hour
if it still exists in you and i hope it does reflect before replying to me consider on the one hand this man whom a word from you may ruin in the other hand justice which a word from you may enlighten
the instant is solemn there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken
rise prisoner
brevet take a good look at the accused recall your souvenirs and tell us on your soul and conscience if you persist in recognizing this jan as your former companion in the galleys jean valjean
brevet looked at the prisoner then turned towards the court
yes mr
president i was the first to recognize him and i stick to it that man is jean valjean who entered at toulon in and left in
i left a year later
he has the aurora brute now but it must be because she has brutalized him he was sky at the galleys i recognize him positively
take your seat said the president
prisoner remain standing
x behold if i was brought in a prisoner for life as was indicated by his dew cassock and his green cap
he was serving out his sentence at the galleys of toulon whence he had been brought for this case
he was a small man of about fifty brisk wrinkled trail yellow brazen faced feverish who had a sort of sicily feebleness about all his limbs and his whole person and an immense force in his glance
his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him i deny god he middle uche nil dieu
the president addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used to brevet
at the moment when he reminded him or his infamy which deprived him of the right to take an oath chen il dish raised his head and looked the crowd in the face
the president invited him to reflection and asked him as he had asked brevet if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner
chen il dish burst out laughing
we were attached to the same chain for five years
so you are sulking old fellow
to take your seat said the president
the usher brought in coche paille
he was another convict for life who had come from the valleys and was dressed in red like chen il dish was a peasant from lourdes and a half fear of the pyrenees
he had guarded the flocks among the mountains and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand
coche paille was no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner
he was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys
the president tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words and asked him as he had asked the other two if he persisted without hesitation or trouble in recognizing the man who was standing before him
he is jean valjean said coche paille
he was even called mean the screw because he was so strong
each of these affirmations from these three men evidently sincere and in good faith had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the prisoner a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding
after the second he said a little louder with an air that was almost that of satisfaction good
at the third he cried famous
the president addressed him have you hear a prisoner
what have you to say
ushers said the president enforce silence
i am going to sum up the arguments
at that moment there was a movement just beside the president a voice was heard crying brevet
chen il dish
coche paille
look here
all who heard that voice were chilled so lamentable and terrible was it all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded
a man placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court had just risen had pushed open the half door which separates the tribunal from the audience and was standing in the middle of them all the president the district attorney m
nakata good twenty persons recognizes him and exclaimed in convert m
madeleine
chapter xi champ mathieu more and more astonished it was being act
he held his hat in his hand there was no disorder in his clothing his coat was carefully buttoned he was very pale and he trembled slightly his hair which has still been gray on his arrival in areas was now entirely white it had turned white during the hour he had sat there
all heads were raised the sensation was indescribable there was a momentary hesitation in the audience the voice had been so heartrending the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first
they asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that dry they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry
this indecision only lasted a few seconds
even before the president and the district attorney could utter a word before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture the man whom all still called at that moment m
madeleine had advanced towards the witnesses coche paille brevet and chemik dieu
do you not recognize me
said he
all three remained speechless and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him
coche paille who was intimidated made a military salute
k
madeleine turned towards the jury and the court and said in a gentle voice gentlemen of the jury order the prisoner to be released
mr
president gave me arrested
he is not the man whom you are in search of it is liam jean valjean
not a mouth breathed the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done
in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district attorney and a few low tones words with the assistant judges be addressed the public and asked if accents which all understood is there a physician present
the district attornet took the word gentlemen of the jury the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us like yourselves only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express
you all know by reputation at least the honorable m
madeleine mayor of m
shrm
if there is a physician in the audience we join the president in requesting him to attend rom
madeleine and to conduct him to his home
n
madeleine did not allow the district attorney to finish he interrupted him in accents full of suavity and authority
these are the words which he uttered here they are literally as they were written down immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene and as they now ring of the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago i thank you md
district attorney but i am not mad you shall see you were on the point of committing a great error release this man
i am fulfilling a duty i am that miserable criminal
i am the only one here who sees the matter clearly and i am telling you the truth
god who is on high looks down on what i am doing at this moment and that suffices
you can take me for here i am but i have done my best i concealed myself under another name i have become rich i have become a mayor i have tried to reenter the ranks of the honest
it seems that that is not to be done
in short there are many things which i can not tell
i will not narrate the story of my life to you you will hear it one of these days
i robbed monseigneur the bishop it is truely is true that i robbed little gervais they were right in telling you that jean valjean was a very vicious wretch
perhaps it was not altogether his fault
listen honorable judge s
a man who has been so greatly humbled as i have had neither any remonstrances to make to providence nor any advice to give to society but you see the infamy from which i have tried to escape is an injurious thing the galleys make the convict what he is reflect upon that if you please
before going to the galleys i was a poor peasant with very little intelligence a sort of idiot the galleys wrought a change in me
i was stupid i became vicious i was a block of wood i became a firebrand
later on indulgence and kindness saved me as severity had ruined me
but pardon me you can not understand what i am saying
you will find at my house among the ashes in the fireplace the forty siu piece which i stole seven years ago from little gervais
i have nothing farther to add take me
good god
madeleine had gone mad
that is distressing
do not at least condemn this man
what
these men do not recognize me
i wish i avert were here he would recognize me
nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words
he turned to the three convicts and caldwell i recognize you do you remember brevet
he paused hesitated for an instant and said to you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys
brevet gave a start of surprise and surveyed him from head to boot with a frightened air
f
p
which are still visible nevertheless answer is this true
it is true said chen il dish
he addressed himself to coche paille coche paille you have near the bend in your left arm a date stamped in blue pervers with burnt powder the date is that of the landing of the emperor at cannes march pull up your sleeve
coche paille pushed up his sleeve all eyes were focused on him and on his bare arm
a gendarme held a light closed out there was the date
the unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile which still renew the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it
it was a smile of triumph it was also a smile of despair
you see plainly he said that i am jean valjean
in that chamber there were no longer either judges advisers not gendarmes there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts
no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play the district attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting the president that he was there to preside the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend
it was a striking circumstance that no question was put that no authority intervened
the peculiarity of sublime spectacles is that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators
no one probably could have explained what he felt no one probably said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light all felt themselves inwardly dazzled
it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes
that was clear
the appearance of this man had sufficed to diffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously without any further explanation the whole crowd as by a sort of electric revelation understood in a tantly and are single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead
the details the hesitations little possible oppositions were swallowed up in that vast and luminous fact
it was an impression which vanished speedily but which was irresistible at the moment
i do not wish to disturb the court further resumed jean valjean
i shall withdraw since you do not arrest me
i have many things to do
the district attorney knows who i am he knows whither i am going he can have me arrested when he likes
he directed his steps towards the door
not a voice was raised not an arm extended to hinder him
all stood aside
at that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man
he traversed the crowd slowly
it was never known who opened the door but it is certain that he found the door open when he reached it
on arriving there he turned round and said i am at home command mr
district attorney
then he addressed the audience all of you all who are present consider me worthy of pity do you not
good god
when i think of what i was on the point of doing i consider that i am to be envied
nevertheless i should have preferred not to have had this occur
he withdrew and the door closed behind him as it had opened for those who do certain sovereign things are always sure of being served by someone in the crowd
less than an hour after this the verdict of the jury freed the said champ mathieu from all accusations and champ mathieu being at once released went off in a state of stupefaction thinking that all men were fools and comprehending nothing of this vision
book eighth
a counter blow chapter ii n what mirror m
madeleine contemplates his hair the day had begun to dawn
fantine had passed a sleepless and feverish night filled with happy visions at daybreak she fell asleep
sisters implode who had been watching with her availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare a new potion of chinchon a
the worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments bending over her drugs and phials and scrutinizing things very closely on account of the dimness which the half light of dawn spreads over all objects
sudden or she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek
m
madeleine stood before her he had just entered silently
is it young
mayor
she exclaimed
he replied in a low voice god is that poor woman
not so bad just now but we have been very uneasy
she explained to him what had passed that fantine had been very ill the day before and that she was better now because she thought that the mayor had gone to mont vermeil together child
the sister dared not question the mayor but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from there
all that is good said he you were right not to undeceive her
yes responded the sister but now mr
mayor she will see you and will not see her child
what shall we say to her
he reflected for a moment
god will inspire us said he
but we can not tell a lie murmured the sister half a loud
it was broad daylight in the room
the light fell full on m
the sister chanced to raise her eyes to it
good roddir
she exclaimed what has happened to you
your hair is perfectly white
white
said he
sisters implode had no mirror
she rummaged in a drawer and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed
m
madeleine took the mirror looked at his hair and said well
he uttered the word in differently and as though his mind were on something else
the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this
he inquired can i see her
is not monsieur lemaire going to have her child brought back to her
said the sister hardly venturing to put the question
of course but it will take two or three days at least
if she were not to see monsieur lemaire until that time went on the sister timidly she would not know that monsieur lemaire had returned and it would be easy to inspire her with patience and when the child arrived she would naturally think monsieur le maine had just come with the child
we should not have to enact a lie
m
madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments then he said with his calm gravity no sister i must see her
i may perhaps be in haste
she replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully in that case she is asleep but monsieur lemaire may enter
she was asleep
her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death
but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which over spread her countenance and which transfigured her in her sleep
her pallor had become whiteness her cheeks were crimson her long golden lashes the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her pal pirated though they remained closed and drooping
her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings all ready to open wide and hear her away which could be felt as they rustled though they could not be seen
to see her this one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of
she resembled rather something on the point of coating away than something in the point of dying
the branch hdd mb les when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time
the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul
m
madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed gazing in turn up in the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months before on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in that asylum
they were both still there in the same attitude she sleeping be praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair was gray and his was white
the sister had not entered with him
he stood beside the bed with his finger on his lips as though there were someone in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence
she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile and cosette
chapter ii fantine happy she made no movement of either surprise or of joy she was not itself
that simple question and cosette
was out with so profound a faith with so much certainty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt that he found not a word of reply
she continued i knew that you were there
i was asleep but i saw you
i have seen you for a long long time
i have been following you with my eyes all night long
you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms
he raised his glance to the crucifix
but she resumed tell me where cosette is
why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking
he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall
fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance
he came to the aid of m
madeleine
calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here
she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness
oh
she exclaimed bring her home
touching illusion of another
cosette was for her still the little child who is carrier
not yet said the doctor not just now
you still have some fever
the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm
you must be cured first
she interrupt e f him impetuously but i am cured
oh i tell you that i am cured
what an ass that doctor is
the idea
i want to see my child
you see said the doctor how excited you become
so long as you are in this state i shall oppose your having your child
it is not enough to see her it is necessary that you should live for her
when you are reasonable i will bring her to you myself
the poor motherboard her head
i beg your pardon doctor i really get your pardon
formerly i should never have spoken as i have just done so many misfortunes have happened to me that i sometimes do not know what i am saying
i understand you you fear the emotion
i will wait as long as you like but i swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter
i have been seeing her i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening
do you know
if she were brought to me now i should talk to her very gently
that is all
is it not quite natural that i should desire to see my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from mont vermeil
i am not angry
i know well that i am about to be happy
all night long i have seen white things and persons who smiled at me
when monsieur le docteur please she shall bring me cosette
i have no longer any fever i am well
i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me anymore but i am going to behave as though i were ill and not stir to please these ladies here
madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed
she turned towards him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in order that seeing her so peaceable they might make no difficulty about bringing cosette to her
but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m
madeleine
did you have a pleasant trip monsieur lemaire
oh
how good you were to go and get her for me
only tell me how she is
die sheet and the journey well
alas
she will not recognize me
she must have forgotten me by this time poor darling
children have no memories
they are like birds
a child see something today and another thing tomorrow and thinks of nothing any longer
and did she have white linen
did those the barriers keep her clean
how have they fed her
oh
if you only knew how i have suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness
now it is all past
i am happy
oh how i should like to see her
do you think her pretty monsieur lemaire
is not my daughter beautiful
you must have been very cold in that diligence
could she not be brought for just one little instant
she might be taken away directly afterwards
tell me you are the master it could be so if you chose
he took her hand
cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well
you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much vivacity and you are the print your arms out from under the clothes and that makes you count
in fact fits of coughing interrupted fantine at nearly every word
fantine did not murmurs he feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring and she began to talk of in different things
none vermeil is quite pretty is it not
people got here on pleasure parties in summer
are the thenardier a prosperous
there are not many travellers in their parts
that inn of theirs is a sort of a cookshop
m
madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated
the doctor having finished his visit retiree
sisters imp life remained alone with them
but in the midst of this pause fantine exclaimed in exeter
mon dieu i hear her
she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath and began to listen with rapture
there was a child playing in the yard the child of the port fessor of some work woman
it was one of those accidents which are always occurring and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage setting of mournful scenes
the child a little girl was going and coming running to warm herself laughing singing at the top of her voice
alas
in what are the plays of children not intermingled
it was this little girl who mean time heard singing
oh
she resumed it is my cosette
i recognize her voice
the child re treated as it had come the voice died away
fantine listened for awhile longer then her face clouded over and m
madeleine heard her way in a low voice how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter
that man has an evil countenance that he has
but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again
she continued to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how happy we are going to be
we shall have a little garden the very first thing m
madeleine has promised it to me
my daughter will play in the garden
she must know her letters by this time
i will make her spell
she will run over the grass after butterflies
i will watch her
then she will take her first communion
ah
when will she take her first communion
she began to reckon on her fingers
one two three four she is seven years old
in five years she will have a white cell and open work stockings she will look like a little woman
she began to laugh
he listened to her words as one listens to the signing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom
all at once she ceased speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanically
fantine had become terrible
sue no longer spoke she no longer breathed she had raised herself to a sitting posture her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise her face which had been radiant but a moment before was ghastly and she seemed to have fixed her eyes rendered large with terror on something alarming at the other extremity of the room
good god
he exclaimed what ails you can find
she made no reply she did not remove her eyes from the object which she seemed to see
she removed one hand from his arm and with the other made him a sign to look behind him
he turned and be held javert
chapter ii in a very satisfied this is what had taken place
the half hour after midnight had just struck when m
madeleine quitted the hall of assizes in areas
he regained his inn justin time to set out again by the mail wagon in which he had engaged his place
shrm
and his first care has been to post a letter to k
laffitte then to enter the infirmary and see fantine
however he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of assizes when the district attorney recovering from his first shock had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of m
shrm
to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident which would be explained thereafter and to demand in the meantime the condemnation of that champ mathieu who was evidently the real jean valjean
the counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that in consequence of the revelations of m
madeleine that is to say of the real jean valjean the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man
thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphone has not very fresh unfortunately up in judicial errors stc
etc
the president in his summing up had joined the counsel for the defence and in a few minutes the jury had thrown champ mathieu out of the case
nevertheless the district attorney was bent on having a jean valjean and as he had no longer champ mathieu he took maddie lbs
immediately after champ mathieu had been set at liberty the district attorney shut himself up with the president
they conferred as to the necessity of seizing the person of m
lemaire of m
shrm
his first emotion having passed off the president did not offer many objections
justice must after all take its course
and then when all was said although the president was a kindly and a tolerably intelligent man he was at the same time a devotee and almost an ardent royalist and he had been shocked to hear the mayor of m
shrm
say the emperor and not bonaparte when alluding to the landing at cannes
the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched
the district attorney forwarded it tom
shrm
by a special messenger at full speed and entrusted its execution to police inspector javert
the reader knows that is very had returned to m
shrm
immediately after having given his deposition
javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner
the messenger himself was a very clever member of the police who in two words informed nader for what had taken place at a draw
the order of arrest signed by the district attorney was couched in these words inspector javert will apprehend the body of the sieur madeleine mayor of m
shrm
anyone who did not know javert and who had chances to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary could have divined nothing of what had taken place and would have thought h i said the most ordinary in the world
he was cool calm grave his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples and he has just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation
anyone who was thoroughly acquainted with him and who had examined him attentively at the moment would have shuddered
the buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck
this betrayed unwonted agitation
havent was a complete character who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform methodical with malefactors rigid with the buttons of his coat
that he should have set the buckle of his stock awry it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes
properly speaking he did not enter
he stood erect in the half open door his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat which was buttoned up to the chin
in the vendor his elbow the leaden head of his enormous came which was hidden behind him could be seen
thus he remained for nearly a minute without his presence being perceived
all at once bantine raised her eyes saw him and made m
madeleine turn round
no human sentiment can be as terrible as joy
it was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul
the satisfaction of at last getting hold of jean valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance
the depths having been stirred up mounted to the surface
the humiliation of having in some slight degree lost the scent and of having indulged for a few moments in an error with regard to champ mathieu was effaced by price at having so well and accurately divined in the first place and of having for so long cherished a just instinct
the deformity of triumph over spread that narrow brow
all the demonstrations of horror which a satisfied face can afford were there
javert was in heaven at that moment
without putting the thing clearly to himself but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success he is very personified justice light and truth in their celestial function of a rushing out evil
behind him and around him at an infinite distance he had authority reason the case judged the legal conscience the public prosecution all the stars he was protecting order he was causing the law to yield up its thunder she was avenging society he was lending a helping hand to the absolute he was standing erect in the midst of a glory
there existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat
erect naughty brilliant he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel
the terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist happy and indignant he held his heel upon crime vice rebellion perdition hell he was radiant be exterminated he smiled and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous saint michael
javert though frightful had nothing ignoble about him
probity sincerity candor conviction the sense of duty see things which may become hideous when wrongly directed but which even when hideous remain grand their majesty the majesty peculiar to the human conscience clings to them in the midst of horror they are virtues which have one vice error
the honest pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubrious it venerable radiance
without himself suspecting the fact javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied acid every ignorant man who triumphs
nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this case wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good
chapter iv authority reasserts its rights fantine had not seen javert since the day on which the mayor had to enter from the man
her ailing brain comprehended nothing but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come together
she could not ensure that terrible face she felt her life quitting her she hid her face in both hands and shrieked in her anguish monsieur madeleine save nf
jean valjean we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise had risen
he said to fantine in the gentlest and calmest of voices be at ease it is not for you that he is some
then he addressed javert and said i know what you want
javert replied be quick about it
the delay in the inflection of voice which accompanied these words something indescribably fierce and frenzied
havent did not say he quick about it
he said bequia boult
no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered it was no longer a human word it was a road
he did not proceed according to his custom he did not enter into the matter he exhibited no warrant of arrest
in his eyes jean valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant who was not to be laid hands upon a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years without being able to throw him
this arrest was not a beginning but amend
he confined himself to saying be quick about it
as he spoke thus he did not advances single step he hurled at jean valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling hook and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him
it was this glance which can find had felt penetrating to the very narrow of her bones two months previously
but the mayor was there what had she tore at
javert advanced to the middle of the room and cried see here now
art thou coming
the unhappy woman glanced about her
no one was present excepting the gun and the mayor
to whom could that abject use of thou be addressed
to her only
she shuddered
then she beheld a host unprecedented things things i unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest delirium soft ever
she beheld javert the police spy seize the mayor by the collar she saw the mayor how his head
it seemed to her that the world was coming to amend
javert had in fact grasped jean valjean by the collar
monsieur lemaire
shrieked fantine
javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums
there is no longer any monsieur lemaire here
jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat
he said javert mx very interrupted him call me md
inspector
monsieur said jean valjean i should like to say a word to you in private
a loud
say it aloud
replies javert people are in the habit of talking aloud to me
jean valjean went on in a lower tone i have a request to make of you i tell you to speak loud
but you alone should hear it what difference does that make home
i shall not listen
three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman
i will pay whatever is necessary
you shall accompany me if you choose
you are making sport of me
dried javert
come now i did not think you such a fool
you ask me to give you three days in which to run away
ah
ah
fantine was seized with a bit of trembling
my child
she cried to go and fetch my child
she is not here then
answer me sister where is cosette
i want my child
monsieur madeleine
monsieur lemaire
is very stamped his foot
will you hold your tongue you hussy
ah
but we are going to change all that it is high time
there is a thief a brigands convict named jean valjean
and i have him in my grasp
fantine raised herself in bed with a bound supporting herself on her stiffened arms and on both hands she gazed at jean valjean she gazed at javert she gazed at the nuns he opened her mouth as though to speak seattle proceeded from the depths of her throat her teeth chartered she stretched out her arms in her agony opening her hands convulsively and fumbling about her like a drowning person then suddenly fell back on her pillow
her head struck the headboard of the bed and fell forwards on her breast with gaping mouth and sharing sight less eyes
she was dead
jean valjean laid his hand upon the detaining handle javert and opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby then he said to javert you have murdered that woman
shouted javert in a fury i am not here to listen to argument
in the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead which was in a decidedly decrepit state and which served the sisters as a camp bed when they were watching with the sick
jean valjean stepped up to this bed in a twinkling wrenched off the head piece which was already in a dilapidated condition an easy matter to muscles like his grasped the principal rod like a bludgeon and glanced at javert
javert retreated towards the door
when he arrived there he turned and said to javert in a voice that was barely audible i advise you not to disturb me at this moment
one thing is certain and that is that is very trembled
it did occur to him to summon the guard but jean valjean might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape so he remained grasped his cane by the small end and leaned against the door post without removing his eyes from jean valjean
jean valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed and his brow on his hand and began to contemplate the motionless body of fantine which lay extended there
he remained this mute absorbed evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life
upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity
after a few moments of this meditation he bent towards fantine and spoke to her in a low voice
what did he say to her
what could this man who was deprived way to that woman who was dead
what words were those
no one on earth heard them
did the dead woman hear them
there are some touching illusions which are perhaps sublime realities
that done be closed her eyes
death that signifies entrance into the great light
jean valjean knelt down before that t and lifted it gently and kissed it
then he rose and turned to javert
now said heisman your disposal
chapter v a suitable tomb javert deposited jean valjean in the city prison
the arrest of m
madeleine occasioned a sensation or rather an extraordinary commotion in m
shrm
we are sorry that we can not conceal the fact that at the single word he was a convict nearly everyone deserted him
in less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten and he was nothing but a convict from the galleys
it is just to add that the details of what had taken place at areas were not yet known
he was a liberated convict
who
the mayor
bah
m
madeleine
yes
really
his name was not madeleine at all he had a frightful name be mean home annoy jean
ah
good god
he has been arrested
arrested
in prison in the city prison while waiting to be transferred
until he is transferred
he is to be transferred
where is me to be taken
he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago
well
i suspected as much
that man was too good too perfect too affected
he refused the cross he bestowed sous on all the little scamp she came across
i always thought there was some evil history back of all that
the drawing rooms particularly abounded in remarks of this nature
one old lady a subscriber to the drapeau blanc made the following remark the depth of which it is impossible to fathom i am not worry
it will be a lesson to the bonapartist s
it was thus that the phantom which had been called m
madeleine vanished from m
shrm
only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory
the old port read who had served him was among the number
on the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge still in a thorough bright and absorbed in sad reflections
the factory had been closed all day the carriage gate was bolted the street was deserted
there was no one in the house but the two guns sister per le tue and sister simply ce who were watching beside the body of fantine
towards the hour when m
madeleine was accustomed to return home the good port red cross mechanically took from a drawer the key of m
then she sat down again on her chair and became absorbed in thought once more
the poor good old woman had done all this without being conscious of it
it was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from here every and exclaimed hold
my good god jesus
and i hung his key on the nail
at that moment the small window in the lodge opened a hand passed through seized the key and the candlestick and lighted the taper at the candle which was burning there
the port read raises her eyes and stood there with gaping mouth and a shriek which she confined to her throat
she knew that hand that arm the sleeve of that cost
it was n
madeleine
it was several seconds before she could speak she had a seizure as she said herself when she relates the adventure afterwards
good god monsieur le maitre he cried at last i thought you were she stopped the com clusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect towards the beginning
jean valjean was still monsieur le mal de toner
he finished her thought
in prison said he
i was the two broke a bar of one of the window so let myself drip from the top of a roof and here i am
i am going up to my room go and find sisters implode for me
she is with that poor woman no doubt
the old woman obeyed in all haste
he gave her no order she was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself
no one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates
he had and always carried about him a passkey which opened a little side door but he must have been searched and his latchkey must have been taken from him
this point was never explained
he ascended the staircase leading to his chamber
on arriving at the top be left his candle on the top step of his stairs opened his door with very little noise went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling then returned for his candle and re entered his room
it was a useful precaution it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street
he cast a glance about him at his table at his chair at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days
no trace of the disorder of the night before last remained
the port read had done up his room only she had plc ord out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two or it ends of the cudgel and the forty so i piece which had been blackened by the fire
he took a sheet of paper in which he wrote these are the two tips of my iron show cudgel and the forty so i piece stolen from little gervais which i mentioned at the court of assizes and he arranged this piece of paper the bits of iron and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen on entering the room
from a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts which he tore in pieces
in the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks
it was probably the prison bread which he had carried with him in his flight
this was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on
there came two tale at the door
come in said he
it was sisters in olive
she was pale her eyes were fed the candle which she carried trembled in her hand
the peculiar feature of the violences of destiny is that however polished or cook we maybe they aging human nature from our very bowels and forfeit to reappear on the surface
the emotions of that day had turned thehun into a woman once more
she had wept and she was trembling
jean valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper which he handed to the nun saying sister you will give this to monsieur le cure
the paper was not folded
she cast a glance upon it
you can read it said he
share a diner monsieur le sure to keep an eye on all that i leave behind me
he will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial and of the funeral of the woman who died yesterday
the rest is for the poor
the sister tried to speak but she only managed to stammer a few inarticulate sounds
she succeeded in saying however does not monsieur lemaire desire to take a last look at that poor unhappy woman
mo said he i am pursued it would only end in their arresting me in that room and that would disturb her
he had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible on the staircase
they heard a tumult of ascending footsteps and the old port read saying in her loudest and most piercing tones my good sir i swear to you by the good god that not a soul has entered this house all day nor all the evening and that i have not even left the door
a man responded but there is a light in that room nevertheless
the chamber was so arranged that the door in opening has led the corner of the wall on the right
jean valjean blew out the light and placed himself in this shuld
sisters implode fell on her knees near the table
the door opened
javert entered
the whispers of many men and the protestations of the port fees were audible in the corridor
thehun did not raise her eyes
she was praying
the candle wax on the chimney piece and gave but very little light
is very caught sight of the gun and halted in amazement
it will be remembered that the fundamental point in java r this element the very aug he breathed was veneration for all authority
this was impregnable and admitted if neither objection not restriction
in his eyes of course the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all he was religious superficial and correct on this point as on all others
in his eyes a priest was a mind who never makes a mistake an un was a creature who never zinc they were souls walked in from this world with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through
of perceiving the sister his first movement was to retire
but there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him imperiously in the opposite direction
his second movement was to remain and to venture on at least one question
this was sisters implode who had never told a lie in her life
javert knew it and held her in special generation in consequence
sister said he are you alone in this room
a terrible moment ensued during which the poor port read felt as though she should faint
the sister raised her eyes and answered yes
then resumed javert you will excuse me if i persist it is my duty you have not seen a certain persons man this evening
he has escaped we are in search of him that jean valjean you have not seen him
the sister replies no
she lied
she had lied twice in succession one after the other without hesitation promptly as a person does when sacrificing herself
pardon me said javert and he retired with a deep now
o sainted maid
you left this world many years ago you have rejoined your sisters the virgins and your brothers the angels in the light may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise
an hour later a man marching amid trees and mists was rapidly departing from m
chem
in the direction of paris
that man was jean valjean
it has been established by the testimony of two or three carters who met him that he was carrying a bundle that he was dressed in a blouse
where had he obtained that blouse
no one ever found out
but an aged workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before leaving behind him nothing but his blouse
perhaps that was the one
one last word about fantine
we all have a mother the earth
fantine was given back to that mother
the cure thought that he was doing right and perhaps here all i was in reserving as much money as possible from what jean valjean had left for the poor
who was concerned after all
a convict and a woman of the town
so fantine was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to anybody and everybody and where the poor are lost
fortunately god knows where to find the soul again
ragtime was laid in the shade among the first bones that came to hand she was subjected to the promiscuous ness of ashes
she was thrown into the public grade
her grave resembled her bed

cosette book first
waterloo chapter l what is met with on the way from nivelles last year on a beautiful may morning a traveller the person who is telling this story was coming from nivelles and directing his course towards la hulpe
he was on foot
he was pursuing a broad paved road which undulated between two rows of trees over the hills which succeed each other raise the road and let it fall again and produce something in the nature of enormous waves
he had passed lili old and bois seigneur isaac
he had just left behind a wood upon an eminence and at the angle of the crossroad by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription ancient barrier no
a public house bearing on its front this sign at the four winds aux quart events
ec have au private cafe
a quarter of a league further on he arrived at the bottom of a little valley where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road
on the right close to the road was an inn with a four wheeler cart at the door a large bundle of hippo less plough a heap of dried brushwood bear a flourishing hedge like smoking in a square hole and a ladder suspended along an old penthouse with straw partitions
a young girl was wedding in a field where a huge yellow poster probably of some outside spectacle such as a parish festival was fluttering in the wind
at one corner of the inn beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating a badly paved path plunged into the bushes
the wayfarer struck into this
after traversing a hundred paces skirting a wall of the fifteenth century surmounted by a pointed table with bricks set in contrast he found himself before a large door of arched stone with a rectilinear in post in the sombre style of louis xiv
flanked by two flat medallions
a severe facade rose above this doors wall perpendicular to the facade almost touched the door and flanked it with an abrupt right angle
in the meadow before the door lay three harrods through which in disorder grew all the flowers of may
the door was closed
the two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker
the sun was charming the branches had that sort shivering of may which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind
a brave little bird probably a lover was carolling on a distracted manner in a large tree
the wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation resembling the hollow of a sphere in the stone on the left at the foot of the poet of the door
at this moment the leaves of the door parted and a peasant woman emerged
she saw the wayfarer and perceived what he was looking at
it was a french cannonball which made that she said to him
and she added that which you see there high trip in the door near a nail is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg
the bullet did not pierce the wood
what is the name of this place
inquired the wayfarer
you go mont said the peasant woman
the traveller straightened himself up
he walked on a few paces and went off to look over the tops of the hedges
on the horizon through the trees he perceived a sort of little elevation and on this elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion
he was on the battlefield of waterloo
chapter ii you go monthly hominy this was a funereal spot the beginning of the obstacle the first resistance which that great woodcutter of europe called napoleon encountered at waterloo the first knot under the blows of his axe
it was a chateau it is no longer anything but a farm
for the antiquary you go montis hugo mins
this manor was built by hugo side of some rel the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the abbey of villiers
the traveller pushed open the door elbowed an ancient cal adj under the porch and entered the courtyard
the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century which here simulates an arcade everything else having fallen prostrate around it
a monumental aspect often has its birth in ruin
in a wall near the arcade opens another arches door of the time of henry iv
this corner of earth could be but have seized it would perhaps have given him the world likewise
chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks
a growl is audible it is a huge dog who shows his teeth and replaces the english
the english behaved admirably there
you go mont viewed on the map as a geometrical plan comprising buildings and enclosures presents a sort of irregular rectangle one angle of which is nicked out
you go month as two doors the southern door that of the chateau and the northern door belonging to the farm
the farm buildings border the courtyard on the south
a bit of the north door broken by the french hangs suspended to the wall
it consists of four plan is mailed to two crossbeams on which the scars of the attack are visible
the northern door which was beaten in by the french and which has had a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the walls handshake open at the bottom of the paddock it is cut squarely in the wall built of stone below if brick above which closes in the courtyard on the north
it is a simple door for carts such as exist in all farms with the two large leaves made of rustic plan is beyond lle the meadows
the dispute over this entrance was furious
for a long time all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door posts
it was there that nauru in was killed
the storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard its horror is visible there the confusion of the ebay was petrified there it lives and it does there it was only yesterday
the walls are in the death agony the stones call the breaches cry aloud the holes are wounds the drooping quivering trees seek to be making an effort to flee
this courtyard was more built upon than it is today
buildings which have since been pulled down then formed et dans and angles
the english barricaded themselves there the french made their way in but could not stand their ground
beside the chapel one winnie the chateau the only ruin now remaining of the manor of you go monte used in a crumbling state disembowelled one might say
the chateau served for a dungeon the chapel for a block house
there men exterminated each other
the french fired on from every point from behind the walls from the summits of the targets from the depths of the cellars through all the casements through all the air holes through every crack in the stones fetched favors and set fire to walls and men the reply to the grapeshot was a conflagration
in the ruined wing through windows garnished with bars of it on the dismantled chambers of the main building of brick are visible the english guards were in ambush in these rooms the spiral of the staircase cracked from the ground floor to the very good appears like the inside of a broken shell
the staircase has two stories the english besieged on the staircase and massed in its upper steps had cut off the lower steps
these consisted of large slabs of blue stone which form a heap among the nettles
half a score of steps still cling to the wall on the first is cut the figure of a trident
these inaccessible steps are solid in their niches
all the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth
there are two old trees there one is dead the other is wounded at its base and is clothed with verdure in april
since it has taken to growing through the staircase
a massacre took place in the chapel
the interior which has recovered its calm is singular
the mass has not been said there since the carnage
nevertheless the altar has been left there an altar of unpolished wood placed against a background of rough teen stone
four whitewashed walls a door opposite the altar two small arched windows over the door a large wooden crucifix below the crucifix a square air holes topped up with a bundle of hay on the ground in one corner an old window frame with the glass all broken to pieces such is the chapel
near the altar there is nailed up a wooden statue of saint anne of the fifteenth century the head of the infant jesus has been carried off by a large hall
the french who were masters of the chapel for a moment and were then dislodged set fire to it
the flames filled this building it was a perfect furnace the door was burned the floor was burned the wooden christ was not burned
the fire preyed upon his feet of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen then it stopped a miracle according to the assertion of the people of the neighborhood
the infant jesus decapitated was less fortunate than the christ
the walls are covered with inscriptions
near the feet of christ this name is to be read benq jones
then these others conde de rio major marquee y marquesa deal macro habana
there are french names with exclamation points a sign of wrath
the wall was freshly white washed in
the nat jobs insulted each other there
it was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which held an axe in its hand this corpse was sub lieutenant legros
on emerging from the chapel a well is visible on the left
there are two in this courtyard
one in a tires why is there to bucket and pulley to this
it is because water is no longer drawn there
why is water not drawn there
because it is full of skeletons
the last person who drew water from the well was named guillaume can kyle pm
he was a peasant who lived at you go mont and was gardener there
on the thorn in this family fled and concealed themselves in the woods
the forest surrounding the abbey of villiers sheltered these unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad for many ways and nights
there are at this day certain traces recognizable such as old files of burned trees which mark the site of these poor bivouacs trembling in the depths of the thickets
guillaume can kyle on remained at you go mint to guard the chateau and concealed himself in the cellar
the english discovered him there
they tore him from his hiding place and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them by administering blows with the boats of their swords
they were thirsty this guillaume brought them water
it was from this well that he drew it
many drank the te their last draught
this well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself
after the engagement they were in haste to bury the dead bodies
death has a fashion of harassing victory and she causes the pest to follow glory
the typhus is a concomitant of triumph
this well was deep and it was turned into a sepulchre
three hundred dead bodies were cast into it
with too much haste perhaps
were they all dead
legend says they were not
it seems that on the night succeeding the interment deeble voices were heard calling from the well
this well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard
three walks part stone part brick and simulating a small square tower and folded like the leaves of a screen surround it on all sides
the fourth side is open
it is there that the water was drawn
the wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless loophole possibly the hole made by a shell
this little tower had a platform of which only the beams remain
the iron supports of the well on the right for macross
on leaning over the eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped up mass of shadows
the base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles
this well has not in front of it that large blue slab which forms the table for all wells in belgium
the slab has here been replaced by a crossbeam against which lean five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones
there is no longer either paul chain or pulley but there is still the stone basin which served the overflow
the rain water collects there and from time to time a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink and then flies away
one house in this ruin the farmhouse is still inhabited
the door of this house opens on the courtyard
upon this door beside a pretty gothic lock plate there is an iron handle with free oils placed slanting
at the moment when the hanoverian lieutenant wild areas perth is handle in order to take refuge in the farm a french sapper heard off his hand with an axe
the family who occupy the house had for their grandfather guillaume can kyle on the old gardener dead long since
a woman with gray hair said to us i saw there
i was three years old
my sister who was older was terrified and wept
they carried us off to the woods
we blues our ears to the earth to hear
i imitated the cannon and went blum
blum
a door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard so we were told
the orchard is terrible
it is in three parts one might almost say in three acts
the first part is a garden the second is an orchard the third is a wood
these three parts have a common enclosure on the side of the entrance the buildings of the chateau and the farm on the left a hedge on the rights walk and at the end a wall
the call on the right is of brick the wall at the bottom is of stone
one enters the garden first
it slopes downwards is planted with gooseberry bushes choked with a wild growth of vegetation and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone with balustrade with a double curve
it was a zeit morial garden in the first french style fh key preceded of notre today it is ruins and briars
the pilasters are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon balls of stone
forty three balusters can still be counted on their sockets the rest lie prostrate in the grass
almost all bear scratches of bullets
one broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured org
it was in this garden further down than the orchard that six light infantry men of the st having made their way thither and being unable to escape hunted down and caught like bears in their dens accepted the combat with two hanoverian companies one of which was armed with carbines
the hanoverians lined this balustrade and fired from above
the infantrymen replying from below six against two hundred intrepid and with no shelter save the currant bushes took a quarter of an hour to die
one mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard properly speaking
there within the limits of those few square fathoms fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour
the wall seems ready to renew the combat
thirty eight loopholes pierced by the english at irregular heights are there still
in front of the sixth are placed two english tombs of granite
there are loopholes only in the south wall as the principal attack came from that quarter
this waterloo began
nevertheless the orchard was taken
as they had no ladders the french scaled it with their nails
they fought hand to hand amid the trees
all this grass has been soaked in blood
a battalion of nassau seven hundred strong was overwhelmed there
this orchard is sentient like others in the month of may
in the middle of the grass one observes an up rooted tree hole which lies there all verdant
major black mann leaned against it to die
beneath a great tree in the neighborhood tell the german general dull at descended from a french family which flew on the revocation of the edict of nantes
an aged and falling apple tree of a is far over to one side its sound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loan
nearly all the apple trees are falling with age
there is not one which has not had its bullet or its biscay an
the skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard
cross fly through their branches and at the end of it is a wood full of violets
if it had no trained in the night between the thanet method june the fate of europe would have been different
a few drops of water more or less decided the downfall of napoleon
all that providence required in order to make waterloo the end of austerlitz was a little more rain and a cloud traversing the sky out of season sufficed to make a world crumble
why
because the ground was set
the artillery had to wait until it became a little former before they could manoeuvre
napoleon was an artillery officer and felt the effects of this
the foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who in the report to the directory in aboukir said such a one of our balls killed six men
all his plans of cattle were arranged for projectiles
the key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point
he treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel and made a breach in it
he overwhelmed the weak point with grapes but he joined and dissolved battles with cannon
there was something of the sharpshooter in his genius
to beat in squares hi pulverize regiments to break lines to crush and disperse masses for him everything lay in this to strike strike strike incessantly and he intrusted this task to the cannonball
a redoubtable method and one which unites with genius rendered this gloomy athlete of the pugilism of war invincible for the space of fifteen years
ont meth of june be relied all the more in his artillery because he had numbers on his side
wellington had only one hundred and fifty nine mouths of fire napoleon had two hundred and forty
what amount of blame attaches to napoleon for the loss of this battle
is the shipwreck due to the pilot
was it the evident physical decline of napoleon that complicated this epoch by an inward diminution of force
had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard the soul as well as the body
did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader
in a word east his genius as many historians of note have thought suffering from an eclipse
did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself
did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure
had he become a grave matter in a general unconscious of peril
is there an age in this class of material great men who may be called the giants of action when genius grows shortsighted
old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal for the dantes and michael angelos to grow old is to grow in greatness is it to grow less for the hannibal s and the bonaparte s
had napoleon lost the direct sense of victory
had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef could no longer divine the snare no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses
had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes
he who had informed days known all the roads to triumph and who from the summit of his chariot of lightning pointed them out with a sovereign finger had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it to the precipice
was he seized at the age of forty six with a supreme madness
was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer anything more than an immense daredevil
we do not think so
his plan of battle was by the confession of all a masterpiece
all this was contained in that battle according to napoleon
afterwards people would dvd
of course we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of waterloo one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are relating is connected with this battle but this history is not our subject this history moreover has been finished and finished in a masterly manner from one point of view by napoleon and from another point of view by a whole o leiaf of historians
as for us we leave the historians at loggerheads we are but a distant witness a passerby on the plains seeker bending over that soil all made of human flesh taking appearances for realities perchance we have no right to oppose in the name of sciences collection of facts which contain illusions no doubt we possess neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorizes system in our opinions chain of accidents dominated the two leaders at waterloo and when it becomes a question of destiny that mysterious culprit we judge like that ingenious judge the populace
chapter iva those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of waterloo have only to place mentally on the grounds capitals
the top of the ais mont saint jean where wellington is the lower left topic you go mont where replie is stationed with jerome bonaparte the right tip is the belle alliance where napoleon was
at the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced
it was there that the lion has been placed the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the imperial guard
the triangle included in the top of the x between the two limbs and the tie is the plateau of mont saint jean
the dispute over this plateau constitu her the whole battle
behind the top of the a behind the plateau of mont saint jean is the forest les lignes
as for the plain itself let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground each rise commands the next rise and all the undulations mount towards mont saint jean and there and in the forest
two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers
it is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist
the one seeks to trip up the other
they clutch at everything a bush is a point of support an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder for the lack of a novel under whose cover they can draw up a regiment yields its ground an unevenness in the ground a chance turn in the landscape across path encountered at the right moments grove at a fine can stay the heel of that dolls she which is called an army and prevent its retreat
he who quits the field is beaten hence the necessity revolving on the responsible leader of examining the most insignificant clump of trees and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground
the two generals had attentively studied the plain of mont saint jean now called the plain of waterloo
in the preceding year wellington with the sagacity of foresight has examined it as the possible seat or a great battle
upon this spot and for this duel ont meth of june wellington had the good post napoleon the bad post
the english army was stationed above the french army below
it is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of napoleon on horseback glass in hand upon the heights of ross on me at daybreak on june
all the world has seen him before we can show him
that figure stood for a long time wholly in the light this arose from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes and which always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time but today history and daylight have arrived
that light called history is pitiless it possesses this peculiar and divine quality that pure light as it is and precisely because it is wholly light it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto be held gays from the same man it constructs two different phantoms and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader
hence arises a truer measure in the definitive judgments of nations
babylon violated lessens alexander rome enchained lessens caesar jerusalem murdered lessens titus tyranny follows the tyrant
it is a misfortune for a man to leave behind him the night which bears his form
chapter v the skid obscurum of battles everyone is acquainted with the first phase of this battle a beginning which was troubled uncertain hesitating menacing to both armies but still more so for the english than for the french
it has rained all night the earth had been cut up by the downpour the water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as i find asks at some points the year of the artillery carriages was buried up to the axles the cir singles of the horses were dripping with liquid mud
if the wheat and the trampled down by this cohort of transports on the harsh had not filled in the ruts and strewn a litter beneath the wheels all movement particularly in the valleys in the direction of pap slot he would have been impossible
the affair began late
napoleon as we have already explained was in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand like a pistol aiming it now at one point now at another of the battle and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop freely
in order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil
but the sun did not make its appearance
it was no longer the rendezvous of austerlitz
when the first cannon was fired the english general colville looked at his watch and noted that it was thirty five minutes past eleven
the action was begun furiously with more fury perhaps than the emperor would have wished by the left wing of the french resting on you go mint
the attack on you go mont was something of a feint the plan was to draw wellington thither and to make him swerve to the left
with the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded pape lotte was taken lahaie sainte was carried
a detail to be noted
these young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubtable infantry their inexperience extricated them intrepid it from the dilemma they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers the soldier skirmished left somewhat to himself becomes so to speak his own general
these recruits displayed some of the french ingenuity and fury
this novice of an infantry haddasu
this displeased wellington
after the taking of lahaie sainte the battle wavered
twilight reigns over it
we perceive vast fluctuations in that for a dizzy mirage paraphernalia of war almost unknown to say pendant col backs floating san detached cross belts cartridge boxes for grenades hussar room and red boots with a thousand wrinkles heavy shall star landed with torsades the almost black infantry of brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of england the english soldiers with great white circular pass on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets the hanoverian light horse with their oblong casques of leather with brass bands and red horsetails the scotch with their bare knees and plaids the great white gaiters of our grenadiers pictures not strategic lines what salvator rosa requires not what is suited to the needs of gri beauval
a certain amount of tempest is always mingled with a battle
quid obscurum skis dj vinum
each historian traces to some extent the particular feature which pleases him amid this pell help
whatever may be the combinations of the generals the shock of armed masses has an incalculable ebb
during the action the plans of the two psad etc enter into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape
such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants than such another just as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which is poured on them
it becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen
the line of battle waves and undulates like a thread the trails of blood bush illogically the fronts of the armies saver the regiments form capes and guida as they enter and withdraw all these reefs are continually moving in front of each other
where the infantry stood the artillery arrives the cavalry rushes in where the artillery was the battalions are like smoke
there was something there are kit
it has disappeared the open spots change place the sombre folds advance and retreats sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward hurl a back dist ends and disperses these tragic multitudes
what is a gray
anos ciliation
the immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute not a day
in order to depict a battle there is required one of those powerful painters who have chaos in their brushes
geometry is deceptive the hurricane alone is trustworthy
that is what confers on folate the right to contradict polybius
let us add that there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat becomes specialized and dispersed into innumerable detailed feats which to borrow the expression of napoleon himself belong rather to the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army
the historian has in this case the evident right to sum up the whole
he can not do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle and it is not given to anyone narrator however conscientious he may be to fix absolutely the form of that horrible cloud which is called a battle
this which is true of all great armed encounters is particularly applicable to waterloo
nevertheless at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a point
the prince of orange was in command of the centre hill of the right wing picton of the left wing
the prince of orange desperate and intrepid shouted to the holland o belgians nassau
brunswick
never retreat
hill having been weakened had come up to the support of wellington picton was dead
at the very moment when the english had captured from the french the flag of the th of the line the french had killed the english general picton with a bullet through the head
the battle had for wellington two bases of action you go mont and lahaie sainte you go mont still held out but was on fire lahaie sainte was taken
of the german battalion which defended it only forty two men survived all the officers except five were either dead or captured
three thousand combatants had been massacred in that barn
a sergeant of the english guards the foremost boxer in england reputed invulnerable by his companions had been killed there by a little french drummer boy
having had been dislodged alten put to the sword
that valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers if bro and beneath the cuirassiers of travers out of twelve hundred horses six hundred remained out of three lieutenant colonel a two lay on the earth hamilton wounded mater spain
ponsonby had fallen riddled by seven lance thrusts
gordon was dead
marsh was dead
two divisions the fifth and the sixth had been annihilated
you to mont injured la baie sainte taken there now existed but one rallying point the centre
that point still held firm
wellington reinforced it
the centre of the english army rather concave very dense and very compact was strongly posted
it occupies the plateau of mont saint jean having behind it the village and in front of it the slope which was tolerably steel then
it rested on that stout stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of nivelles and which marks the intersection of the roads a pile of the sixteenth century and so robust that the cannon balls rebounded from it without injuring it
all about the plateau the english had cut the hedges here and there made embrasures in the hawthorne fees thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches embattled the shrubs
there artillery was ambushed in the brushwood
this assured and buttressed the centre of the anglo dutch army was well posted
the peril of this position lay in the forest les lignes then adjoining the field of battle and intersected by the ponds of groenendael and to its fort
an army could not retreat thither without dissolving the regiments would have broken up immediately there
the artillery would have been lost among them or asses
the retreat according to many a man versed in the art though it is disputed by others would have been a disorganized flight
this placed twenty six battalions under his hand
the right wing as chart assays was thrown back on the centre
an enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the museum of waterloo
it was the remaining half of the justly celebrated english cavalry
ponsonby destroyed somerset remained
the battery which it completed would have been almost are doubt was ranged behind a very low garden wall backed up with a coating of bags of sand and a large slope of earth
this work was not finished there had been no time to make a palisade for it
wellington uneasy but impassive was on horseback and there remained the whole day in the same attitude a little in advance of the old mill of mont saint jean which is still in existence beneath and in which an englishman an enthusiastic vandal purchased later on for two hundred francs cut down and carried off
wellington was coldly heroic
the bullets raines about him
his aide de camp gordon fella this code
lord bill pointing to a shell which had burst said to him my lord what are your orders in case you are killed
to do like he replied wellington
to clinton he said laconically to hold this spot to the last man
the day was evidently turning out ill
wellington shouted to his old companions of talavera of vittoria of salamanca boys can retreat be thought of
think of old england
suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of the plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters the rest had disappeared the regiments dislodged by the shells and the french bullets retreated into the bottom now intersected by the backroad of the farm of mont saint jean a retrograde movement took place the english front rid itself wellington feedback
the beginning of retreat
cried napoleon
chapter vii napoleon in a good humor the emperor though ill and wisdom moved on horseback by a local trouble had never been in a better humor than on that day
how impenetrability had been smiling ever since the morning
ont meth of june that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly
the man who had been gloomy at austerlitz was gay at waterloo
the greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes
our joys are composed of shadow
rider caesar pompeius for big said the legionaries of the fulminate is legion
pompey was not destined to weep on that occasion but it is certain that caesar laughed
napoleon was mistaken
they were no longer in accord
he took not a moment for sleep every instant of that night was marked by a joy for him
he traversed the line of the principal outposts halting here and there to talk to the sentinels
at half past two near the wood if you go months heard the tread of a column on the march he thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of wellington
he said it is the rear guard of the english getting underway for the purpose of de camping
i will take prisoners the six thousand english who have just arrived at ostend
he conversed expansively he regained the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of match when he pointed out to the grand marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the gulf juan and cried well bertrand here is a reinforcement already
on the night of the tutor herb of june her allies wellington
that little englishman needs a lesson said napoleon
the rain redoubled in violence the thunder rolled while the emperor was speaking
nothing was stirring not a bivouac fire had been extinguished the english army was asleep
the silence on earth was profound the only noise was in the heavens
so much the better
exclaimed napoleon
i prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them back
in consequence of the rains during the night the transports of provisions embedded in the soft roads had not been able to arrive by morning the soldiers had had no sleep they were wet and fasting
this did not prevent napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to hey we have ninety chances out of a hundred
he invited many general stout
the emperor nested with hey who said wellington will not be so simple as to wait for your majesty
that was his way however
he was time of nesting says fleury dec he toulon
a merry humor was at the foundation of his character says you fraud
he abounded in pleasantries which were more peculiar than witty says benjamin constant
the senate ties of a giant are worthy of insistence
it was he who called his grenadiers his grumbler she pinched their ears he pulled their mustaches
the emperor did nothing but play pranks on us is there mark of one of them
a man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events
napoleon indulged in many bits of this laughter during the breakfast at waterloo
after breakfast he hesitated for a quarter of an hour then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw pen in hand and their paper on their knees and the emperor dictated to them the order of battle
magnificent
a few moments after the formation of the battle array in the midst of that profound silence like that which he takes the beginning of a storm which precedes engagements the emperor capped back on the shoulder as he beheld the three batteries of twelve pounders detached by his orders from the corps over long silks and lo bay and destined to begin the action by taking mont saint jean which was situated at the intersection of the nivelles and there nappe roads and said to him there are four and twenty handsome maids general
sure of the issue he encouraged with a smile as they passed before him the company of sappers of the first corps which he had appointed to barricade mont saint jean as soon as the village should be carried
all this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of naughty pity perceiving on his left at a spot where there now stands a large tomb those admirable scotch beats with their superb horses massing themselves he said it is a pity
then he mounted his horse advanced beyond ross on me and selected to this post of observation a contracted elevation of turf to the right of the road from gen apps to brussels which was his second station during the battle
around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road up to napoleon himself
as at brienne he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and if the heavy artillery
scabra rubin one
a few years ago as hell of sixty pounds still charged and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb was unearthed
it was at this last post that the emperor said to his guide lacoste a hostile and terrified peasant who was attached to the saddle of a hussar and who turned round at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind napoleon fool it is shameful
he who writes these lines has himself found in the friable soil of this knoll on turning over the sand the remains of the neck of a bomb disintegrated by the oxidization of six and forty years and old fragments of iron which parted like elder twigs between the singers
everyone is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains where the engagement between napoleon and wellington took place are no longer what they were on june
by taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it its real relief has been taken away and history disconcerted no longer finds her bearings there
it has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying in
wellington when he beheld waterloo once more two years later exclaimed they have altered my field of battle
where the great pyramid of earth surmounted by the lion rises today there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the nivelles road but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to geballe
the elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchres which enclose the road from gen apps to brussels one the english tomb is on the left the other the german tomb is in the right
there is no french tomb
the whole of that plain is a sepulchre for france
thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cart loads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference the loates job mont saint jean is now accessible by an easy slope
on the day of battle particularly on the side of lahaie sainte it was abrupt and difficult of approach
the slope there is so steep that the english cannon could not see the farm situated in the bottom of the valley which was the centre of the combat
ont meth of june the rains had still farther increased this acclivity the kid complicated the problem of the ascent and the men not only slipped back but stuck fast in the more
along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of french whose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine
what was this trench
let me explain
these villages both of them concealed in curves of the landscape are connected by a road about a league and a half in length which traverses the plain along its undulating level and often enters and buried itself in the hills like a furrow which makes a ravine of this road in some places
in as at the present day this road cut the crest of the plateau of mont saint jean between the two highways from gen apps and nivelles only it is now on a level with the plain it was then a hollow way
its two slopes have been approp fished for the monumental hillock
this road was and still is a trench throughout the greater portion of its course a hollow french sometimes a dozen feet in depth and whose banks being too steep crumbled ads there and there particularly in winter under driving rain s
accidents happened here
it was so deep in the table land of mont saint jean that a peasant mathieu nicaise was crushed therein by a slide from the slope as is staged on another stone cross the top of which has disappeared in the process of clearing the ground but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the grassy slope to the left of the highway between labs is saints and the farm of mont saint jean
on the day of battle this hollow road whose existence was in no way indicated bordering the crest of mont saint jean a trench at the summit of the escarpment a rut concealed in the soil was in visit is that is to say terrible
chapter viii the emperor puts a question to the guide lacoste so on the morning of waterloo napoleon was content
he was right the plan of battle conceived by him was as we have seen really admirable
napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war he never added up the heartrending details cipher by cipher ciphers mattered little to him provided that they furnished the total victory he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the end he knew how to wait supposing himself to be out of the question and he treated destiny as his equal he seemed to say to date thou wilt not care
com lisse half of light and half of shadow napoleon thought himself protected in good and tolerated in evil
he had or thought that he had a connivance one might almost say a complicity of events in his favor which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity
nevertheless when one has beers in a leipzig and fontainebleau behind one it seems as though one might distrust waterloo
a mysterious brown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens
at the moment when wellington be treated napoleon shuddered
jesus we not be held the table land of mont saint jean cleared and the fan of the english army disappear
it was rallying but hiding itself
the emperor half rose in his stirrups
the lightning of victory flashed from his eyes
wellington driven into a corner at the forest les lignes and destroyed that was the definitive conquest of england by france its secrecy poitiers map plaque hand ramillies avenged
the man of marengo was wiping out agincourt
so the emperor meditating on this terrible turn of fortune swept his glass for the last time overall the points of the field of battle
his guard standing behind him with grounded arms watched him from below with a sort of religion
he pondered be examined the slopes noted there do i cities scrutinized the clumps of trees the square of the the path he seemed to be counting each bush
the guide made a negative sign with his head which was probably perfidious
the emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking
wellington had drawn back
all that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him
napoleon turn it ground abruptly despatched an express at full speed to paris to announce that the battle was win
napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts
he had just found his slap of thunder
chapter ix the unexpected there were three thousand five hundred of them
they formed a front a quarter of a league in extent
they were giant men in colossal horses
they wore casques without horsetails and cuirasses of beaten it on with horse pistols in their holsters and long sabres words
net drew his sword and placed himself at their head
the enormous squadrons were set in motion
then a formidable spectacle was seen
all their cavalry with upraised swords standards and trumpets clung to the freeze formed in columns by divisions descended by a simultaneous movement and like one man with the precision of a brazen battering ram which is effecting an reach the bill of labelle alliance plunged into the terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen disappeared there in the smoke then emerging from that shadow reappeared on the other side of the valley still compact and in close ranks mounting at a full trot through a storm of grapeshot which burst upon then the terrible muddy slope of the table land of mont saint jean
they ascended grave threatening imperturbable in the intervals between the musketry and the artillery their colossal trampling was audible
it seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the tableland
it traverses the battle like a prodigy
nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of them us iowa by the heavy cavalry murat was lacking here but hey was again present
it seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul
each column insulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp
they could be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there
x confusion of helmets of cries of sabres a stormy heading of the drippers of horses amid the canyons and the flourish of trumpets a terrible and disciplines tumult overall the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra
these narrations seemed to belong to another age
something parallel to this vision appeared no doubt in the ancient pro nice pics which told of the centaurs the old hip panty ropes those titans with human heads and equestrian chests who scaled olympus at a gallup horrible invulnerable sublime gods and beasts
odd numerical coincidence twenty six battalions rode to meet twenty six battalions
behind the crest of the plateau in the shadow of the masked battery the english infantry formed into thirteen squares two battalions to the square in two lines with seven in the first line six in the second the sticks of their guns to their shoulders taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing waited calm mute motionless
they did not see the cuirassiers and the cuirassiers did not see them
they listened to the rise of this flood of men
they heard the dwelling house of three thousand horse the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their goods at full trot the mingling of the cuirasses the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing
all this cavalry de boucheron the plateau and it was like the appearance of an earthquake
all at once a tragic incident on the english left in our right the head of the column of cuirassiers reared up with a frightful clamor
on arriving at the culminating point of the crest ungovernable utterly given over to fury and their course of extermination of the squares and cannon the cuirassiers had just caught sight of a trench a trench between them and the english
it was the hollow road o domain
it was a terrible moment
this began the loss of the battle
a local tradition which evidently exaggerate a matters says that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road o domain
this figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat
warner nevertheless and put on the alert by the little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the nivelles highway he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle to the guide lacoste
the guide has answered no
other fatalities were destined to arise
was it possible that napoleon should have won that battle
we answer no
why
because of wellington
because of boucher
no
because of god
bonaparte victor at waterloo that does not come within the law of the nineteenth century
another series of facts was in preparation in which there was no longer any room for napoleon
the ill will of events had declared itself long before
it was time that this vast man should fall
the excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance
this individual alone counted for more than a universal group
these plethora so fall human vitality concentrated in a single head the world mounting to the brain of one man this would be mortal to civilization were it to last
the moment had arrived for the incorruptible and supreme equity to alter its plan
probably the principles and the elements in which the regular tr agitations of the moral as of the material world depend had complain es
smoking blood overfilled cemeteries mothers in tears these are formidable p leaders
when the earth is suffering from too heavy a burden there are mysterious groanings of the shares to which the abyss lends an ear
napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been decided on
he embarrassed god
waterloo is not a battle it is a change of front on the part of the universe
chapters the plateau of mont saint jean the battery was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine
sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point blank on the cuirassiers
the intrepid general report made the military salute to the english battery
the whole of the flying artillery of the english has reentered the squares at a gallop
the cuirassiers had not had even the time for a half
the disaster of the hollow road had decimated but not discouraged them
they belonged to that class of men who when diminished in number increase in courage
the cuirassiers hurled themselves on the english squares
at full speed with bridles looses words in their teeth pistols in dust such was the attack
there are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until the soldier is changed into a statue and when all this flesh turns into granite
the english battalions desperately assaulted did not stir
then it was terrible
all the cases of the english squares were attacked at once
a frenzied whirl enveloped them
that cold infantry remained impassive
the first rank knelt and received the cuirassiers on their bayonets the second banks shot them down behind the second rank the cannon were charged their find the front of the square partes permitted the passage of an eruption of grapeshot and closed again
the cuirassiers replied by crushing them
their great horses reared strode across the ranks leaped over the bayonets and fell gigantic in the midst of these four living wells
the cannon balls ploughed burrows in these cuirassiers the cuirassiers made breaches in the squares
files of men disappeared ground to dust under the horses
the bayonet a plunged into the bellies of these centaurs hence a hideousness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else
the squares wasted by this had cavalry closed up their ranks without flinching
the form of this combat was monstrous
these squares were no longer battalions they were craters those cuirassiers were no longer cavalry they were a tempest
each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud lava contended with lightning
the square on the extreme right the most exposed of all being in the air was almost annihilated at the very first shock
it was formed of the th regiment of highlanders
the bagpipe player in the centre dropped his melancholy eyes filled with the reflections of the forests and the lakes in profound in attention while men were being exterminated around him and seated on a drum with his pin rich under his arm played the highland aids
these scotch men died thinking of ben lothian as did the greek are falling argos
the sword of a cuirassiers hiv the wed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it put an end to the song by killing the singer
the cuirassiers relatively few in number and still further diminished by the catastrophe of the ravine had almost the whole english army against them but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal to ten
nevertheless some hanoverian battalions yielded
wellington perceived it and thought of his cavalry
had napoleon at that same moment thought of his infantry he would have won the battle
this forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake
all at once the cuirassiers who had been the assailants found themselves assailed
the english cavalry was at their back
before them two squares behind them somerset somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard
on the right somerset had worn berg with the german light horse and on his left trip with the belgian data binders the suit ass legs attacked on the flank and in front before and in the rear by infantry and cavalry had to face all sides
what mattered it to them
they were a whirlwind
their valor was something indescribable
in addition to this they had behind them the battery which was still thundering
it was necessary that it should be so if they could never have been wounded in the back
one of their cuirasses pierced on the shoulder by a ball from a bid catania in the collection of the waterloo museum
for such frenchmen nothing less than such englishmen was needed
it was no longer a hand to hand conflict it was a shadows fury a dizzy transport of souls and courage a hurricane of lightning swords
in an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred
fuller their lieutenant colonel fell dead
the plateau of mont saint jean was captured recaptured captured again
the cuirassiers quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry or to put it more exactly the whole of that formidable your collared each other without releasing the other
the squares still held firm
there were a dozen assaults
net had four horses killed under him
half the cuirassiers remained on the plateau
this conflict lasted two hours
the english army was profoundly shaken
there is no doubt that had they not been enfeebled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow road the cuirassiers would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory
this extraordinary cavalry petrified clinton who had seen talavera and badajoz
wellington three quarters vanquished admired heroically
he said in an undertone sublime
the cuirassiers annihilated seven squares out of thirteen tool or spiked sixty pieces of ordnance and captured from the english regiments six flags which three cuirassiers and three chasseurs of the guard bore to the emperor in front of the farm of labelle alliance
this strange battle was like a duel between two rating wounded men each of whom still fighting and still resisting is expending all his blood
which of the two will be the first to fall
the conflict on the plateau continued
what had become of the cuirassiers
no one could have told
one thing is certain that in the day after the battle a cuirassiers nd his horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at mont saint jean at the very point where the four roads from nivelles gen appel a tulle and brussels meet and intersect each other
this horseman had pierced the english lines
one of the men who picked up the body still lives at mont saint jean
his name is de haze
he was eighteen years old at that time
wellington felt that he was yielding
the crisis was at hand
the cuirassiers had not succeeded since the centre was not broken through
as everyone was in possession of the plateau no one held it and in fact it remained to a great extent with the english
wellington held the village and the culminating plain net had only the crest and the slope
they seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides
but the weakening of the english seemed irremediable
the bleeding of that army was horrible
kempton the left wing demanded reinforcements
there are gone replied wellington he must let himself be killed
almost at that same moment a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies net demanded infantry from napoleon and napoleon exclaimed infantry
where does he expect me to get it
does he think i can make it
nevertheless the english army was in the worse case of the two
the furious on sets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing
the loss in officers was considerable
lord uxbridge who had his leg buried on the following day had his knee shattered
the second regiment of foot guards had lost five lieutenant colonel scout captains and three ensigns the first battalion of the th infantry had lost officers and soldiers the th highlanders had lost officers wounded officers killed soldiers killed
the hanoverian hussars of cumberland a whole regiment with colonel jack eat its head who was destined to be tried later on and cashiered had turned bridle in the presence of the fray and had fled to the forest of sourness owing defeat all the way to brussels
the transports ammunition wagons the baggage wagons the wagons filled with wounded in perceiving that the french were gaining ground and approaching the forest rushed headlong thither
the dutch mowed down by the french cavalry cried alarm
from very coucou to grow brenda el for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of brussels according to the testimony of eye witnesses who are still alive the roads were encumbered with fugitives
this panic was such that it attacked the prince second eat mechlin and louis xviii
at ghent
a number of batteries latin horses
these facts are attested by sib or brand pringle exaggerating the disaster goes so far as to say that the anglo dutch army was reduced to thirty four thousand men
the iron duke remained calm but his lips blanched
ginseng the austrian commissioners kava the spanish commissioner who were present at the battle in the english staff thought the duke list
it was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed in the heights in the direction of frl scheming
here comes the change of face in this giant drama
chapter xi a bad guide to be pile on a good guide to bulow the painful surprise of napoleon is well known
grouchy hoped for blucher arriving
death instead of life
date has these turns the throne of the world was expected it was saint helena that was seen
napoleon would have won the battle of waterloo
by any other route than that below plans en out the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery and bulow would not have arrived
the battle was lost
it was time that bulow should arrive as will be seen
he had moreover been very much delayed
he had bivouacked at dion lemony and had set out at daybreak but the roads were impassable and his divisions stuck fast in the more
the guts were up to the hubs of the cannons
moreover he had been obliged to pass the by leon the narrow bridge of wavre the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the french so the caissons and ammunition wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished
such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which we can not comprehend
the emperor had been the first as early as midday to descry with his field glass on the extreme horizon something which had attracted his attention
he had saudi see yonder a cloud which seems to me to be troops
then he asked the duc de dal marie soult what do you see in the direction of chapelle saint lambert
the marshal levelling his glass answered four or five thousand men site evidently grouchy
but it remained motionless in the mist
all the glasses of the staff had studied the cloud pointed out by the emperor
some said it is trees
the truth is that the cloud did not move
bulow had not moved in fact
his vanguard was very feeble and could accomplish nothing
history records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in acclamations
the sky had been overcast all day long
they had seen it rise at austerlitz
each battalion of the guard was commanded by a general for this final catastrophe
friant michel robust market mallet old et de morgan were there
when they all caps of the grenadiers of the guard with their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared symmetrical in line tranquil in the midst of that combat the enemy delta respect for france they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field of battle with wings out spread and those who were the conquerors believing themselves to be vanquished retreated but wellington shouted up guards and sim straight
the red regiment of english guards lying flat behind the hedges sprang up a cloud of grapeshot riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles all hurled themselves forwards and the final carnage began
and with flight behind it it continued to advance more crusted losing more met at every step that it took
there were no new to hesitated no timid men in its ranks
the soldier in that troop was as much of a hero as the general
not a man was missing in that suicide
net bewildered great with all the grandeur of accepted death offered himself to all blows in that tempest
he had his fifth horse killed under not there
perspiring his eyes aflame foaming at the mouth with uniform unbuttoned one of his epaulets half cut off by a sword stroke from a horse guard his plaque with the great eagle degree by a bullet bleeding be hired magnificent a broken sword in his hand he said come and see how a marshal of france dies on the field of battle
but in vain he did not die
he was haggard and angry
in the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men he shouted so there is nothing for me
oh
i should like to have all these english bullets enter my bowels
unhappy man thou wert reserved for french bullets
chapter xiii the catastrophe the rout behind the guard was melancholy
the army yielded suddenly on all sides at once you go mont lahaie sainte pspell the plan ceno it
the cry treachery
was followed by a cry of save yourselves who can
an army which is disbanding is like a thaw

the disintegration is unprecedented

he is overwhelmed
the soldiers fly from him shouting long live marshal net
log what one extremity and grille at the other are drawn into the tire
in vain does napoleon erect walls from what is left to him of his guard in vain does he expend in a last effort his last serviceable squadrons
napoleon gallops past the line of fugitives harangues urges threatens en treats them
all the mouths which in the morning had shouted long live the emperor
remain gaping they hardly recognize him
the prussian cavalry newly arrived dashes forwards flies news slashes kills exterminates
horses lash out the cannons flee the soldiers of the artillery train in harness the caissons and use the horses to make their escape transports overturned with all four wheels in the air clog the road and occasion massacres
men are crushed trampled down others walk over the dead and the living
arms are lost
a dizzy multitude fills the roads the paths the bridges the plains the hills the valleys the woods encumbered by this invasion of fifty thousand men
shouts despair knapsacks and guns flung among the the passages forced at the point of the sword no more comrades no more officers no more general san inexpressible terror

the prussians threw themselves into renal of furious no doubt that they were not more entirely the conquerors
the pursuit was stupendous
boucher ordered extermination
robust had set the lugubrious example of threatening with death any french grenadier who should bring him a prussian prisoner
boucher outside of yet
funds me the general of the young guard hemmed in at the doorway of an inns the nappe surrendered his sword to a huszar of death who took the sword and slew the prisoner
the victory was completed by the assassination of the vanquished
let us inflict punishment since we are history old blucher disgraced himself
this ferocity put the finishing touch to the disaster
the desperate route traversed be nappe traversed quatre bras traversed to see lies traversed crashes traversed charleroi traversed thu in and only halted at the frontier
alas
and who then was fleeing in that magnet
the grand army
this vertigo this terror this down fall into ruin of the loftiest bravery whichever astounded history is that cause less
no
the shadow of an enormous right is projected at heart waterloo
it is the day of destiny
the force which is mightier than man produced that day
hence the terrified wrinkle of this endows hence all those great souls surrendering their swords
those who had conquered europe have fallen prone on the earth with nothing left to say not to do feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence
hose rating atis
that day the perspective of the human race underwent a change
waterloo is the kings of the nineteenth century
the disappearance of the great man was necessary to the advent of the great century
someone a person to whom one replies not took the responsibility in himself
the panic of heroes can be explained
in the battle of waterloo there is something more than a cloud there is something of the meteor
god has pas des by
at nightfall i james down warren apps bernard and bertrand seized by the skirt of his coat and detained a man haggard pensive sinister gloomy who dragged to that point by the current of the rough adjust dismounted had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm and with wild eye was returning alone to waterloo
it was napoleon the immense somnambulist of this dream which has crumbled essaying once more to advance
chapter xiv the last square several squares of the guard motionless amid this stream of the defeat as rocks in running water held their own until night
night came death also they awaited that double shadow and invincible allowed them selves to be enveloped there in
each regiment isolated from the rest and having no bond with the army now shattered in every part died alone
they had taken up position for this final action some on the heights of ross on me others on the plain of mont saint jean
there abandoned vanquished terrible those gloomy squares endured their death throes in formidable fashion
ulm way damien a friedland dies with them
in that fatal valley at the foot of that declivity which the cuirassiers had ascended now inundated by the masses of the english under the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry under a frightful density of projectiles this square fought on
it was commanded by an obscure officer named cambronne
at each discharge the square diminished and replies
it replied to the grapes not with a fusillade continually contracting its four walks
the fugitives pausing breathless for a moment in the distance listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ever decreasing thunder
when this legion had been reduced to a handful when nothing was left of their flag but arab when their guns the bullets all gone were no longer anything but clubs when the heap of corpses was larger than the group of survivors there reigned among the conquerors around those men dying so sublimely a sort of sacred terror and the english artillery taking breath became silent
this furnished a sort of respite
through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded the matches all lighted like the eyes of tigers at night formed a circle round their heads all the long stocks of the english batteries approached the far more and then with emotion holding the supreme moment suspended above the semen an english general colville according to some maitland according to others shouted to them surrender brave frenchmen
cambronne replies
in lieu of the above
chapter xv cambronne if any french reader object to having his suscepti bilities offended one would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps the finest reply that a frenchman ever made
this would en join us from consigning something sublime to history
at our own risk and peril let us violate this injunction
now then among those giants there was one titan cambronne
to make that reply and then perish what could be grander
the winner of waterloo was cambronne
to thunder forth such a reply at the lightning flash that kills you is to conquer
it was an insult such as a thundercloud might hifi
it reaches the grandeur of aeschylus
who conquered
wellington
no
had it not been for blucher he was lost
was it boucher
no
if wellington had not begun blucher could not have finished
this cambronne this man spending his last hour this unknown soldier this infinitesimal of war realizes that here is a falsehood a falsehood in a catastrophe and so doubly agonizing and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of it he is offered this mockery life
how could be restrain himself
he will protest
then he seeks for the appropriate word as one seeks for a sword
his mouth froths and the froth is the word
in fact of this mean and mighty victory in face of this victory which counts none victorious this desperate soldier stands erect
he grants its overwhelming immensity but he establishes its triviality and he does more than spit upon it
borne down by numbers by superior force by brute matter he finds in his soul an expression excrement
we repeat it to use that word to do this to indent such an expression is to be the conqueror
the spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent on that unknown man
cambronne invents the word for waterloo as do i get invents the marseillaise under the visitation of a breath from on high
an emanation from the divine whirlwind leaps forth and comes sweeping over these men and then shape and one of them sings the song supreme and the other utters the frightful cry
this challenge of titanic scorn cambronne girls not only at europe in the name of the empire that would be a trifle he hurls it at the past in the name of the revolution
it is heard and cambronne is recognized as possessed by the ancient spirit of the titans
canton seems to be speaking
kleber seems to be bellowing
at that word from cambronne the english voice response drive
the batteries blamed the hill trembled from all those brazen mouths belched a last terrible gush of grapeshot a fast volume of smoke vaguely white in the light of the rising moon rolled out and when the smoke dispersed there was no longer anything there
that formidable remnant had been annihilated the guard was read
chapter xvi quot libras induce
the battle of waterloo is an enigma
it is as obscure to those who do not as to those who lost it
for napoleon it was a panic blucher sees nothing in it but fire wellington understands nothing in regard to it
look at the reports
the bulletins are confused the commentaries involved
some stammer others lisp
jomini divides the battle of waterloo into four moment shuffling cuts it up into three changes that ras al one though we hold another judgment than his on some points seized with his naughty glance the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance
all the other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled and in this dazzled state the grumble about
it was a day of lightning brilliancy in fact a crumbling of the military monarchy which to the vast stupefaction of kings drew all the kingdoms after it the fall of force the defeat of war
in this event stamped with superhuman necessity the part played by men amounts to nothing
if we take waterloo from wellington and blucher do we thereby deprive england and germany or anything
no
neither that illustrious england north at august germany enter into the problem of waterloo
thank heaven nations are great independently of the lieu brooks feats of the sword
neither england not germany nor france is contained in a scabbard
at this epoch when waterloo is only a clashing of swords above blucher germany has schiller above wellington england has byron
a vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century and in that aurora england and germany have a magnificent radiance
they are majestic because they think
the elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them it proceeds from themselves and not from an accident
the aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has not waterloo as its source
it is only barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory
that is the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm
civilized people especially in our day are neither elevated nora based by the good or bad fortune of a captain
their specific gravity in the human species results from something more than a combat
their honor thank god
their dignity their intelligence their genius are not numbers which those gamblers heroes and conquerors can put in the lottery of battles
often a battle is lost and progress is conquered
there is less glory and more liberty
the drum holds its peace reason takes the word
it is a name in which he who loses wins
let us therefore speak of waterloo solely from both sides
let us render to chance that which is due to chance and to god that which is due to god
what is waterloo
a victory
no
the winning number in the lottery
the quine won by europe paid by france
it was not worthwhile to place a lion there
waterloo moreover is the strangest encounter in history
napoleon and wellington
they are not enemies they are opposites
never did god who is fond of antitheses make a more striking contrast a more extraordinary comparison
on one side precision foresight geometry prudence an assured retreat reserves spared with an obstinate coolness anim perturb able method strategy which takes advantage of the ground tactics which preserve the equilibrium of battalions carnage executed according to rule war regulated watching and nothing voluntarily left to chance the ancient classic courage absolute regularity of the other intuition divination military oddity super human instinct a flaming glance an indescribable something which gases like an eagle and which strikes like the lightning a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity all the mysteries of a profound soul associated with destiny the stream the plain the forest the hill summoned and in a manner forced to obey the deal of going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle faith in a star mingled with strategic science elevating but perturbing it
wellington was the bare me of war napoleon was its michael angelo and on this occasion genius was vanquished by calculation
on both sides someone was awaited
it was the exact calculator who succeeded
napoleon was waiting for grouchy he did not come
wellington expected blucher became
wellington is classic war taking its revenge
bonaparte atm is dawning had encountered him in italy and beaten him superbly
the old owl had fled before the young culture
the old tactics had been not only struck as by lightning but disgraced
who was that corsican of six and twenty
what signified that splendid ignoramus who with everything against him nothing in his favor without provisions without ammunition without cannon without shoes almost without an army with a mere handful of men against masses buried himself in europe combined and absurdly won victories in the impossible
whence had issued that fulminating convict who almost without taking breath and with the same set of combatants in hand pulverized one after the other the five armies of the emperor of germany upsetting beaulieu on alvina i wurmser on beaulieu melas on wurmser jack on melas
who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary
the academical military school excommunicated him and as it lost its footing hence the implacable rancor of the old caesarian against the new of the regular sword against the flaming sword and of the exchequer against genius
one method june that rancor had the last word
and beneath lodi montebello montego the mantua arcola it wrote waterloo
a triumph of the mediocre s which is sweet to the majority
destiny consented to this irony
in his decline napoleon found wurmser the younger again in front of him
in fact to get wurmser it suffices to blanch the hair of wellington
waterloo is a battle of the first order won by a captain of the second
that which must be admired in the battle of waterloo is england the english firmness the english resolution the english blood the superb thing about england there no offence to her was herself
it was not her captain it was her army
wellington oddly ungrateful declared in a letter to lord bathurst that his army the army which fought on the th of june was a detectable army
what does that sombre intermingling of bonds buried beneath the furrows of waterloo think of that
england has been too modest in the matter of wellington
to make wellington so great is to be little england
wellington is nothing but a hero like many another
wellington was tenacious in that lay his merit and we are not seeking to lessen it but the least of his foot soldiers and of his cavalry would have been as solid as he
the iron soldier is worth as much as the iron duke
as for us all our glorification goes to the english soldier to the english army to the english people
if trophy there be it is to england that the trophy issue
the column of waterloo would be more just if instead of the figure of a man ignore on high the statue of a people
but this great england will be angry at what we are saying here
she still cherishes after her own and out the feudal illusion
she believes in heredity and hierarchy
this people surpassed by none in power and glory regards itself as a nation and not as a people
and as a people it willingly subordinates itself and takes a logs for its head
as a workman it allows itself to be disdained as a soldier it allows itself to be flogged
it will be remembered that at the battle of inkerman na sergeant who had it appears saved the army could not be mentioned by lord parlan as the english military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports
that which we ashlee above all in an encounter of the nature of waterloo is the marvellous cleverness of chance
on the whole let us say it plainly it was more of a massacre than of a battle at waterloo
of all pitched battles waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants
napoleon three quarters of a league wellington half a league seventy two thousand combatants on each side
from this denseness the carnage a rose
the following calculation has been made and the following proportion established loss often at austerlitz french fourteen percent russians thirty percent austrians forty four percent
at wagram french thirteen percent austrians fourteen
at the moskow a french thirty seven percent russians forty four
at bautzen french thirteen percent russians and prussians fourteen
at waterloo french fifty six percent the allies thirty one
total for waterloo forty one percent one hundred and forty four thousand combatants sixty thousand dead
today the field of waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth the impassive support of man and it resembles all plains
at night moreover a sort of visionary most arises from it and if a travellers trolls there if he listens if he watches if he dreams like virgil in the fatal plains of philippi the hallucination of the catastrophe takes possession of him
the frightful fh of june lives again the false monumental hillock disappears the lion vanishes in air the battlefield resumes its reality lines of infantry undulate over the plain furious gallops traverse the horizon the frightened dreamer beholds the flash of sabres the gleam of bayonets the flare of bombs the tremendous interchange of thunder she hears as it were the death rattle in the depths of a tomb the vague clamor of the battle phantom those shadows are grenadiers those lights are cuirassiers that skeleton napoleon that other skeleton is wellington all this no longer exists and yet it clashes together and combats still and the ravines are em purples and the trees quiver and there is fury even in the clouds and in the shadows all those terrible heights you go mony mony saint jean frisch em on to spell the plan ceno it appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other
chapter xvii is waterloo to be considered good
there exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hard waterloo
we do not belong to it
to us waterloo is but the stupefied date of liberty
that such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is certainly unexpected
it is europe against france it is petersburg berlin and vienna against paris it is the status up against the initiative it is the th of july attacked through the type march it is the monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable french rioting
the final extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty six years such was the dream
the solidarity of the brunswick st he has said the roman offs the hohenzollern s the hapsburgs with the bourbons
waterloo bears divine right on its crupper
it is true that the empire having been despotic the kingdom by the natural reaction of things was forced to be liberal and that a constitutional order was the unwilling result of waterloo to the great regret of the conquerors
it is because revolution can not be really conquered and that being providential and absolutely fatal it is always cropping up a fresh before waterloo in bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones after waterloo in louis xviii
granting and conforming to the charter
bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of naples and a sergeant on the throne of sweden employing inequality to demonstrate equality louis xviii
at saint ouen counter signs the declaration of the rights of man
if you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is call it progress and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress call it tomorrow
tomorrow fulfils its work irresistibly and it is already fulfilling it today
it always reaches its goal strangely
it employs wellington to make of boy who was only a soldier an orator
fly balls at hong phony and rises again in the tribune
this does progress proceed
there is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman
it does not become disconcerted but adjusts to its divine work the man who has best ridden the alps and the good old tottering invalid of father elysee
it makes use of the four than as well as of the conqueror of the conqueror with out of the youth man within
waterloo by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the sword had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction
the slashers have finished it was the turn of the thinkers
the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march
that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty
it was the counter revolution which murmured that infamous word dismemberment
on arriving in paris it be held the crater close at hand it felt those ashes which scorched its feet and it changed its mind it returned to the stammer of a charter
let us behold in waterloo only that which is in waterloo
of intentional liberty there is none
the counter revolution was involuntarily liberal in the same manner as by a corresponding phenomenon napoleon was involuntarily revolutionary
ont meth of june the mounted robespierre was hurled from his saddle
chapter xviii a recrudescence of divine right end of the dictatorship
a whole european system crumbled away
the empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the roman world as it expired
again we behold the abyss as in the ways of the barbarians only the barbarism of which must be called by its pet name of the counter revolution was not long breathed soon fell to panting and halted short
the empire was he wept let us acknowledge the fact and he wept by heroic eyes
if glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre the empire had been glory in person
it had diffused over the earth all the light which tyranny can give a sombre light
we will say more an obscure light
compared to the true daylight it is night
this disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse
louis xviii
reentered paris
the circling dances of the th of july effaced the enthusiasms of the th of march
the corsican became the antithesis of the nearness
the flag on the dome of the tuileries was white
the exile reigned
boy vines and fontenoy were mentioned as though they had taken place on the preceding day austerlitz having become antiquated
the altar and the throne fraternize d majestically
one of the most undisputed forms of the health of society in the nineteenth century was established over france and over the continent
europe adopted the white cockade
free taillon was celebrated
where there had been an imperial guard there was no waterhouse
and marie antoinette latin that dust
pope pius vii
who had performed the coronation very heart his death tranquilly bestowed his blessing on the fall as he had bestowed it on the elevation
at schoenbrunn there was a little shadow aged four whom it was seditious to call the king of rome
this was a sort of lugubrious april
ancient unhealthy and poisonous realities were covered with new appearances
a lie wedded the right divine was masked under a charter fiction a became constitutional prejudices superstitions and mental reservations with article in the heart were varnished over with liberalism
man had been rendered both greater and smaller by napoleon
under this reign of splendid matter the ideal had received the strange name of ideology
it is a grave imprudence in a great man to turn the future onto derision
the populace however that food for cannon which is so fond of the cannon wed sought him with its glance
where is he
what is he doing
napoleon is dead said a passerby to a veteran of marengo and waterloo
he dead
imagination distrusted this man even when overthrown
the depths of europe were full of darkness after waterloo
the kings placed themselves in this void
ancient europe profited by it to undertake reforms
there was a holy alliance belle alliance beautiful alliance the fatal field of waterloo had said in advance
in presence and in fact of that antique europe reconstructed the features of a new france were sketched out
the future which the emperor had rallied made its entry
on its grow it bore the star liberty
the glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it
singular fact
people were at one and the same time in love with the future liberty and the past napoleon
defeat had rendered the vanquished greater
bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than napoleon erect
those who had triumphed were alarmed
england had him guarded by hudson lose and france had him watched by ming chen y
his folded arms became a source of uneasiness to thrones
alexander called him my sleeplessness
this terror was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained in him
that is what explains and excuses bonapartist liberalism
this phantom caused the old world to tremble
the kings reigned but i lost their ease with the rock of saint helena on the horizon
while napoleon was passing through the death struggle at longwood the sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of waterloo were quietly rotting and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world
the congress of vienna made the treaties in and europe called this the restoration
this is what waterloo was
but what matters it to the infinite
all that tempest all that cloud that war then that peace
all that darkness did not trouble for a moment the light of that immense eye before which shrubs killing from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to belfry in the towers of notre dame
chapter xix the battlefield at night let us return it is a necessity in this book to that fatal battlefield
ont meth of june the moon was full
such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes
after the last cannon shot had been fired the plain of mont saint jean remained deserted
the english occupied the encampment of the french it is the usual sign of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished
they established their bivouac beyond ross on me
the prussians let loose on the retreating to it pushed forward
wellington went to the village of waterloo to draw up his report to lord bathurst
if ever thesis gps none of use as applicable it certainly is to that village of waterloo
waterloo took no part and pay half a league from the scene of action
mont saint jean was cannon a red you go mont was burned la make sainte was taken by assault pape lotte was burned plan ceno it was burned la belle alliance be held the embrace of the two conquerors these names are hardly known and waterloo which worked not in the battle bears off all the honor
we are not of the number of those who flatter war when the pc casio g presents itself we tell the truth about it
war has frightful beauties which we have not concealed it has also we acknowledge some hideous features
one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the busies of the dead after the victory
the dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses
who does this
who thus soils the triumph
what hideous furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory
what pickpockets are they wholly their trade in the rear of glory
some philosophers voltaire among the number affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory
it is the same men they say there is no relief corps those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth
the hero of the day is the vampire of the night
one has assuredly the right after all to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse
for our own part we do not think so it seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and por lo in the shoes from a deadman
one thing is certain which is that generally after conquerors follow thieves
but let us leave the soldier especially the contemporary soldier out of the question
every army has a rear guard and it is that which must be blamed
no army no nation was responsible for those beings they spoke italian and followed the germans then spoke french and followed the english
it was by one of these wretches a spanish straggler who spoke french that the marquis offer vasquez received by his picard jargon and taking him for one of our own men was traitorous lys pain and robbed on the battlefield itself in the course of the night which followed the victory offer is olds
the rascal sprang from this marauding
the detestable maxim live on the enemy
produced this leprosy which a strict discipline alone could heal
there are reputations which are deceptive one does not always know why certain generals great in other directions have been so popular
turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage evil permitted constitutes part of goodness
turenne was so good that he allowed the palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood
the marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number according as the chief was more or less severe
noche and marceau had no stragglers wellington had few and we do him the justice to mention it
never the lesson the night from the tutor method june the dead were robbed
wellington was rigid he gave orders that anyone caught in the act should be shot but rapine is tenacious
the marauders a role in one corner of the battlefield while others were being shot in another
the moon was sinister over this plain
towards midnight a man was prowling about or rather climbing in the direction of the hollow road o domain
to all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described neither english nor french neither peasant not soldier less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having the ch for his victory and come to rifle waterloo
he was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat he was uneasy and audacious he walked forwards and gazed behind him
who was this man
the night probably knew more of him than the day
he had no sack but evidently he had large pockets under his coat
from time to time he halted scrutinised the plain around him as though to see whether he were observed bent over abruptly disturbed something silent and motionless on the ground then rose and fled
his sliding motion his attitudes his mysterious and rapid gestures caused him to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins and which ancient norman legends call the all rugs
certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the marshes
perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler
the darkness was serene
not a cloud in the zenith
what matters it if the earth bered
the moon remains white these are turin differences of the sky
in the fields branches of trees broken by grapeshot but not fallen upheld by their bark swayed gently in the breeze if night
a breath almost a respiration moved the shrubbery
quivers which resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass
in the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the english camp were audible
you go mont and lahaie sainte continued to burn forming one in the west the other in the east two great flames which were joined by the cordon of bivouac fires of the english like a necklace of rubies with two carbuncles at the extremities as they extended in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon
we have described the catastrophe of the road o domain
the heart is terrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many brave men
there where that lamentable disaster had uttered its death rattle all was silence now
the edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders inextricably heaped up
terrible entanglement
there was no longer any slope for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain and reached the brim like a well filled bushel of barley
a heap of dead bodies in the upper part a river of blood in the lower part such was that road on the evening of the th of june
the blood ran even to the nivelles highway and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the what is of trees which barred the way at a spot which is still pointed out
it will be remembered that it was at the opposite point in the direction of the gene poe road that the destruction of the cuirassiers had taken place
the thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road
the nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going in that direction
he was searching that vast tomb
he gazed about
he passed the dead in some sort of hideous review
he walked with his feet in the blood
all at once he paused
a few paces in front of him in the hollow road at the point where the pile of dead came to an end an open hand illumined by the moon projected from beneath that heap of men
that hand had on its finger something sparkling which was a ring of gold
the man bent over remained in a crouching attitude for a moment and when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand
he did not precisely rise he remained in a stopping and frightened attitude with his back turned to the heap of dead scanning the horizon on his knees with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his two forefingers which rested on the earth and his head perring above the edge of the hollow road
then coming to a decision he rose to his feet
at that moment he gave a terrible start
he felt someone clutch him from behind
he wheeled found it was the open hand which had closed and had seized the skirt of his coat
an honest man would have been terrified this man burst into a laugh
i prefer we look to a gendarme
but the hand weakened and released him
effort is quickly exhausted in the grave
well now said the prowler is that dead fellows live
he bent down again fumbled among the heap pushed aside everything that was in his way seized them and grasped the arm freed the head pulled out the body and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless or at least the unconscious man through the shadows of hollow road
he was a cuirassiers n officer and even an officer of considerable rank a large gold e paulette peeped from beneath the cuirass this officer no longer possessed a helmet
a furious sword cut had scarred his face where nothing was discernible but blood
however he did not appear to have any broken limbs and by some happy chance of that word is permissible here the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed
his eyes were still closed
on his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the legion of honor
the pro else tore off this cross which disappeared into one of the rules which he had beneath his great coat
next he searched his waistcoat found a purse and pocket edit
when he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering to this dying man the officer opened his eyes
thanks he said feebly
the abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him the freshness of the night the air which he could inhale freely had roused him from his lethargy
the prowler made no reply
he raised his head
a sound of footsteps was audible on the plain some patrol was probably approaching
the officer murmured for the death agony was still in his voice who won the battle
the english answered the prowler
the officer went on lookin my pockets you will find a watch and a purse
take them
it was already done
the prowler executed the required front and said there is nothing there
i have been robbed said the officer i am sorry for that
you should have had them
the steps of the patrol became more and more distinct
someone is coming said the prowler with the movement of a man who is taking his departure
the officer raised his arm feebly and detained him
you have saved my life
who are you
the prowler answered rapidly and in a low voice like yourself i belonged to the french army
i must leave you
if they were to catch me they would shoot me
i have saved your life
now get out of the scrape yourself
what is your rank
sergeant
what is your name
thenardier
i shall not forget that name said the officer and do you remember mine
my name is pont mercy
book second
the ship orion chapter i number becomes number jean valjean had been recaptured
the reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad details
we will confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs published by the journals of that day a few months after the surprising events which had taken place atm
shrm
these articles are rather summary
it must be remembered that at that epoch the gazette des tribunaux was not yet in existence
we borrow the first from the drapeau blanc
it bears the date of july
an arrondissement of the pas de calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course
a man who was a stranger in the department and who bore the name of m
madeleine had thanks to the new methods resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets
he had made his fortune in the business and that of the arrondissement as well we will admit
he had been appointed mayor in recognition of his services
the police discovered that m
madeleine was no other than a new convict who had broken his ban condemned in for the brand names jean valjean
jean valjean has been recommitted to prison
it appears that precious to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of m
laffitte a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there and which he had moreover and by perfectly legitimate means acquired in his business
no one has been able to discover where jean valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at toulon
the second article which enters a little more into detail is an extract from the journal de paris of the same date
a former convict who had been liberated named jean valjean has just appeared before the court of assizes of the bar under circumstances calculated to attract attention
this wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police he had changed his name and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our email northern towns in this town he had established a considerable commerce
he has at last been unmasked and arrested thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor
he had for his concubine a woman of the town who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest
this scoundrel who is endowed with herculean strength found means to escape but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands on him once more in paris itself at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of mint been close ones to use
he is said to have profited by this interval of three of four days of liberty to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers
this sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs
if the indictment is to be trusted he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone and it has not been possible to lay hands on it
however that may be the said jean valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the department of the far as accused of highway robbery as companied with violence about eight years ago on the person of one of those honest children who as the patriarch of ferney has said in immortal verse
arrive from savoy every year and who with gentle hands do clear those long canals choked up with soot
this bandit refused to defend himself
it was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor that the theft was committed in complicity with others and that jean valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south
jean valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence
this criminal refused to lodge an appeal
the king in his inexhaustible clemency has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life
jean valjean was immediately taken to the prison at toulon
the reader has not forgotten that jean valjean have di if you sha bits atm
shrm
some papers among others the constitutional present rd this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party
jean valjean changed his number in the galleys
he was called
however and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject the prosperity of m
shrm
vanished with m
madeleine all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitations we realized lacking him there actually was a soul lacking
after this fall there took place atm
shrm
that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day obscurely in the human community and which history has noted only once because it occurred after the death of alexander
lieutenants are crowned king s superintend ents improvise manufacturers out of themselves
envious rivalries a rose
m
some of them quitted the country others abandoned the trade
thenceforth everything was done on a small scale instead of on a grand scale for lucre instead of the general good
there was no longer a centre everywhere there was competition and animosity
m
madeleine had reigned over all and directed all
no sooner had her silent fan each pulled things to himself the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization bitterness to cordiality hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all the threads which m
madeleine had set were tangled and broken the methods were adulterated the products were debased confidence was killed the market diminished for lack of orders salaries were reduced the works tips stood still bankruptcy arrived
and then there was nothing more for the poor
all had vanished
the state itself perceived that someone had been crushed somewhere
less than four years after the judgment of the court of assizes establishing the identity of jean valjean and m
madeleine for the benefit of the galleys the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement of m
shrm
and m
deville is called attention to the fact in the rostrum in the month of february
there exists in the region of montrer tell a very ancient superstition which is all the more curious and all the more precious because a popular superstition in the vicinity of paris is like an aloe in siberia
we are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant
here then is the superstition of mont vermeil it is thought that the devil from time immemorial has selected the forest as a hiding place for his treasures
good wives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall in secluded no one of the forests black man with the air of a carter ira wood chipper wearing wooden shoes clad in trousers and a blouse of linen and recognizable by the fact that instead of a call that he has two immense horns on his head
this ought in fact to render him recognizable
this man is habitually engaged in digging a hold
there are three ways of profiting by such an encounter
the first is to approach the man and speak to him
then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant that he appears black because it is nightfall that he is not digging any hole whatever but is cutting grass for his cows and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung form which he is carrying in his back and whose teeth thanks to the perspective of evening seemed to spring from his head
the man returns home and dies within the week
the second way is to watch him to wait until he has dug his hole until he has filled it and has gone away then to run with great speed to the french to open it once more and to seize the treasure which the black man has necessarily placed there
in this case one dies within the month
one then dies within the year
as all three methods are any ended with their special inconveniences the second which at all events presents some advantages among others that of possessing a treasure if only for a month is the one most generally adopted
so bold men who are tempted by every chance have quite frequently as we are assured opened the holes excavated by the black man and tried to rob the devil
the success of the operation appears to be but moderate
at least if the tradition is to be believed and in particular the two enigmatical lines in barbarous latin which an evil norman monk a bit of a sorcerer names gryphon has left on this subject

now a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict jean valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around mont vermeil it was remarked in that village that seed gain old road laborer named boulay ruelle had peculiar ways in the forest
people thereabouts thought they knew that this boulay ruelle had been in the galleys
he was subjected to certain police supervision and as he could find work nowhere the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road gender on the cross road from rat ny to lanny
this boulay ruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as too respectful too humble too prompt in removing his cap to everyone and trembling and smiling in the lee sense of the gendarmes probably affiliated to robber bands they said suspected of lying in ambush at verge of copses at nightfall
the only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard
this is what people thought they had noticed of late boulay ruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone breaking and care of the road at a very early hour and to be taking himself to the forest with his pickaxe
he was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings in the wildest thickets and he had the appearance of being in search of something and sometimes he was digging holes
the good wives who passed took him at first for beelzebub then they recognized boulay ruelle and were not in the least reassured thereby
these encounters seemed to cause you la true ile a lively displeasure
it was evident that he sought to hide and that there was some mystery in what he was doing
it was said in the village it is clear that the devil has appeared
boulay ruelle has seen him and is on the search
the cold air ians added will boil a true old catch the devil or will the devil watch boulay ruelle
the old women made a great many signs of the cross
he has been in the galleys said the barrier
eh
good god
no one knows who has been there or will be there
one evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what boulay fuelled it in the forest and that the latter would have been forced to speak and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need and that nokia gruelle would not have resisted the water test for example
let us put him to the winetest said the barrier
they made an effort and got the old road mender to drinking
go up at fuelled rank an enormous amount but said very little
he combined with admirable art and in masterly proportions the thirst of a form and user with the discretion of a judge
nevertheless by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him this is what the barrier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out one morning when boulay ruelle was on his way to his work at daybreak he had been surprised to see at a book of the forest in the underbrush a shovel and a pickaxe concealed as one might say
however he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of father six fours the water carrier and would have thought no more about it
but on the evening of that day he saw without being seen himself as he was hidden by a large trees person who did not belong in those parts and whom he boulay ruelle knew well directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood
translation by thenardier a comrade of the galleys
boulay ruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name
this person carries a package something square like a large box or a small trunk
surprise on the part of boulay rudolf
however it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that person had occurred to him
but it was too late the person was already in the thicket night had descended and boulay ruelle had not been able to catch up with him
then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods
it was moonlight
two or three hours later boulay ruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood carrying no longer the coffee but a shovel and pick
boulay ruelle had allowed the person to pass and had not dreamed of accosting him because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him and on perceiving that he was recognized
touching effusion of two old comrades in meeting again
but the shovel and pick had served as a day of light to boil at ruelle he had hastened to the thicket in the morning and had found neither shovel now pick
from this he had drawn the inference that this person once in the forest has dug a hole with his pick buried the coffee and re closed the hole with his shovel
now the coffee was too small to contain a body therefore it contained money
hence his researches
foul a true low had explored sounded searched the entire forest and the thicker and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up
in vain
he had ferreted out nothing
no one of mont vermeil thought any more about it
there were only a few brave gossips who said you may be certain that the mend from the gag myriad did not take all that trouble for nothing new assure that the devil had come
chapter iii the ankle chain must have undergone a certain preparatory manipulation to be thus broken with a blow from a hammer towards the end of october in that same year the inhabitants of toulon be held the entry into their port after heavy weather and for the purpose of repairing some damages of the ship orion which was employed later at great as a school ship and which then formed a part of the mediterranean squadron
this vessel battered as it was for the sea had handled it roughly produced a fine effect as it entered the roads
it flew some colors which procured for it the regulation salute of eleven guns which it returned shot for shot total twenty two
it has been calculated that what with salvos royal and military politeness es courteous exchanges of uproar signals of etiquette formalities of roads years and citadels sunrises and sunsets saluted every day by all for tresses and all ships of war openings and closings of ports etc
the civilized world discharged all over the earth in the course of four and twenty hours one hundred and fifty thou send useless shots
at six francs the shot that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day three hundred millions a year which vanish in smoke
this is a mere detail
all this time the poor were dying of hunger
the year was what the restoration called the epoch of the spanish war
this war contained many events in one and a quantity of peculiarities
age and family affair for the house of bourbon the branch of france su scoring and protecting the branch of madrid that is to say performing an act revolving on the elder an apparent return to our national traditions complicated by servitude and by subjection to the cabinets of the north m
such was this war made by the princes descended from louis xiv
and conducted by generals who had been under napoleon
its sad fate was to recall neither the grand warn of grand politics
some feats of arms were serious the taking of the trocadero among others was a fine military action but after all we repeat the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound the whole effect was suspicious history approves of france for making a difficulty about accepting this false triumph
it seemed evident that certain spanish officers charged with resistance yielded too easily the idea of corruption was connected with the victory it appears as though generals and not battles had been won and the conquering soldier returned humiliated
are basing war in short in which the bank of france could be read in the folds of the flag
soldiers of the war of on whom saragossa had fallen in formidable ruin drowned in at the easy surrender of citadels and began to regret palafox
it is the nature of france to prefer to have to stop chine rather than ballesteros in front of her
from a still more serious point of view and one which it is also proper to insist upon here this war which sounded the military spirit of france enraged the democratic spirit
it was an enterprise or in the aiment
in that campaign the object of the french soldier the son of democracy was the conquest of a joke for others
a hideous contradiction
france is made to arouse the soul of nations not to stifle it
all the revolutions of europe since are the french revolution lindy the arts days from france
that is a solar fact
blind is he who will not see
it was bonaparte who said it
the war of an outrage on the generous spanish nation was then at the same time an outrage on the french revolution
it was france who committed this monstrous violence by foul means for with the exception of wars of liberation everything that armies do is by foul means
the words passive obedience indicate this
an army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum of impotence
this is war made by humanity against humanity despite humanity explained
as for the bourbons the war of was fatal to them
they took it for a success
they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order
they went astray in their innocence to such a degree that they introduced the immense enfeeble ment of a crime into their establishment as an element of strength
the spirit of the ambush entered into their politics
had its term in
the spanish campaign became in their counsels an argument for force and for adventures by right divine
france having reestablished el rey netto in spain might well have reestablishes the absolute king at home
they fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for the consent of the nation
such confidence is the ruin of thrones
it is not permitted to fall asleep either in the shadow of a machine el green or in the shadow of an army
let us return to the ship orion
during the operations of the army commanded by the prince generalissimo a squadron had been cruising in the mediterranean
we have just stated that the orion belonged to this fleet and that accidents of the sea had brought it into port at toulon
the presence of a vessel of war in a port has something about it which attracts and engages a crowd
it is because it is great and the crowd loved what is great
a ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the genius of man with the powers of nature
a ship of the line is composed at the same time of the heaviest and the lightest of loss idle matter for it deals at one and the same time with three forms of substance solid liquid and fluid and it must do battle with all three
it has eleven flaws of iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea and more wings and more antennae than winged insects to catch the wind in the clouds
its breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannon was through enormous trumpets and replies proudly to the thunder
the ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its billows but the vessel has its soul its compass which counsel sit and always shows it the north
in the blackest nights its lanterns supply the place of the stars
thus against the wind it has its cordage and its canvas against the water wood against the rocks it sit on brass and lead against the shadows of slight against immensity a needle
if one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which taken as a whole constitute the ship of the line one has only to enter one of the six story covered construction stocks in the ports of brest or to blog
the vessels in process of construction are under a bell glass there as it were
this colossal beam is a yard that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the mainmast
making it from its root in the stocks to its too in the clouds it is sixty fathoms long and its diameter at its base is three feet
the english mainmast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the waterline
the navy of our fathers employed cables ours employs chains
the simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high twenty feet in breadth and eight feet in depth
and how much wood is required to make this shop
three thousand cubic meters
it is a floating forest
and moreover let this be borne in mind it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago of the simple sailing vessels team then in its infancy has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel
at the present time for example the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine propelled by three thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horsepower
not to mention these new marvels the ancient vessel of christopher columbus and of deruyter is one of the masterpieces of man
it is as inexhaustible in force as is the infinite in gales it stores up the wind in its sails it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows it floats and it reigns
every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense feebleness it affords men food for thought hence in the ports curious people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why
everyday accordingly from morning until night the quays splices and the jetties of the port of toulon were covered with a multitude of idlers and loungers as they say in paris whose business consisted in staring at the orion
the orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time in the course of its precious cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keep to such a degree as to deprive i got half its speed it had gone into the dry dock the year before this in order to have the barnacles scraped off then it had put to sea again but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel in the neighborhood of the balearic isles the sides had been strained and had opened and as the playing in those days was not of sheet or on the vessel had sprung a leak
a violent equinoctial gale had come up which had first staged in a grating and a porthole on the larboard side and damaged the fore topgallant shrouds in consequence of these injuries the orion had run back to toulon
it anchored near the arsenal it was fully equipped and repairs were begun
the hull had received no damage on the starboard but some of the planks had been in nailed here and there according to custom to permit of air entering the gold
one morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident
it was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance not one of the sailors all fishermen of the coast recently levied for the service dared to attempt it
in the meantime the unfortunate top man was losing his strength his anguish could not be discerned in his face but his exhaustion was visible in every limb his arms were contracted in horrible twitching s every effort which he made to reads and served but to augment the oscillations of the footrope he did not shout for fear of exhausting his strength
all were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the rope and from instant go instant heads were turned aside that his fall might not be seen
there are moments when a bit of rope a pole the branch of a tree is life itself and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and fall like a ripe fruit
all at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the ability of a tigers at this man was dressed in red he was a convict he wore a green cap he was a life convict
on arriving on a level with the top a gust of wind carried away his cap and allowed a perfectly whitehead to be seen he was not a young man
in a twinkling he was on the yard he paused for a few seconds and appeared to be measuring it with his eye these seconds during which the breeze swayed the top man at the extremity of a thread seemed centuries to those who were looking on
at last the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced estep the crowd drew a long breath
he was seen to run out along the yard on arriving at the point he fastened the rope which he had brought to it and allowed the other end to hang down then he began to descend the role hand over hand and then and the anguish was indescribable instead of one man suspended over the gulf there were two
one would have said it was a slower coming to seize a fly only here the spider brought life not death
ten thousand glances were fastened on this group not a cry not a word the same tremor contracted every brow all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men
in the meantime the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a position near the sailor
it was high time one minute more and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss
the convict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clung with one hand while he was working with the other
at last he was seen to climb back on the yard and to drag the sailor up after him he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength then he grasped him in his arms and carried him walking on the yard himself to the cap and from there to the main top where he left him in the bands of his comrades
at that moment the crowd broke into applause old convict sergeants among them self and women embraced each other on the quay and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rate pardon for that man
he in the meantime had immediately begin to make his descent to rejoin his detachment
in order to reach them the more speedily he dropped into the rigging and ran along one of the lower jared all eyes were following him
at a certain moment fear assailed them whether it was that he was fatigue for that his head turned they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger
all at once the crowd uttered a loud stout the convict had fallen into the sea
the fall was perilous
the frigate algeciras was anchored alongside the orion and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels it was to be feared that he would slip under one of the other of them
four men flung themselves hastily into a goat the crowd cheered them on anxiety again took possession of all souls the man had not risen to the surface he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple as though he had fallen into a cask of oil they sounded they cover
in vain
the search was continued until the evening they did not even find the body
on the following day the toulon newspaper printed these lines nov
yesterday a convict belonging to the detachment on board of the orion on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor fell into the sea and was drowned
the body has not yet been found it is supposed that it is entangled among the piles of the arsenal point this man was committed under the number and his name was jean valjean
book third
accomplishment of the promise made to the dead woman chapter i the water question at mont vermeil king vermeil is situated between live hand chelles on the southern edge of that lofty table land which separates the our cq from the marne
at the present day it is a tolerably large town ornamented all the year through with plaster villas and on sundays with beaming bourgeois
in there were at mo mt vermeil neither so many white house snow so many well satisfied citizens it was only a village in the forest
some pleasure houses of the last century were to be met right here to be sure which were recognizable by their grand air their balconies in twisted iron and their long windows who seeing pages cast all sorts of varying shades of green on the white of the closed shutters but mont vermeil was nonetheless a village
retired cloth merchants and rustic aging attorneys had not discovered it as yet it was a peaceful and charming place which was not on the road to anywhere there people lived and cheaply that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy only water was rare there on account of the elevation of the plateau
it was necessary to fetch it from a considerable distance the end of the village towards gay nude edits water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there
the other end which surrounds the church and which lies in the direction of chelles found drinking water only at a little spring halfway down the slope near the road to chelles about a quarter of an hour from mont vermeil
thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water
this constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten little cosette
it will be remembered that cosette was useful to the the barriers in two ways they made the mother pay them and they made the child serve them
so when the mother ceased to pay altogether the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters the thenardier slept cosette
she took the place of a servant in their house
in this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required
so the child who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night took great care that water should never be lacking in the house
christmas of the year was particularly brilliant at mont vermeil
the beginning of the winter had been mild there had been neither shown or frost up to that time
these people filled the inns and drinking shops and communicated to that tranquil little districts noisy and joyous life
in order to play the part of a faithful historian we ought even to add that among the curiosities displayed in the square there was a menagerie in which frightful clowns clad in rags and coming no one knew whence exhibited to the peasants of mont vermeil in one of those horrible brazilian cultures such as our royal museum did not possess until and which have a tricolored cockade for an eye
i believe that naturalists call this bird caracara polygon is it belongs to the order of the api codes and to the family of the vultures
some good old bonapartist soldiers who had retired to the village went to add this creature with great devotion
the mountebank s gave out that the tricolored cockade was a unique phenomenon made by god expressly for their menagerie
this room resembled all drinking shop rooms tables pewter jugs bottles drinkers smokers but little light and a great deal of noise
the date of the year was indicated nevertheless by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class to wit a kaleidoscope and a lamp of ribbed tin
the female thenardier was attending to the supper which was roasting in front of a clear fire her husband was drinking with his customers and talking politics
besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects the spanish war and m
when ten pieces were reckoned on there have been twelve
they have yielded a great deal of juice under the press
but the grapes can not be ripe
on those parts the grapes should not be rule the wine turns oily as soon as spring comes
then it is very thin wine
there are wines poorer even than these
the grapes must be gathered while green
etc
ora miller would call our are we responsible for what is in the sacks
we find in them a quantity of small seed which we can not sift out and which we are obliged to send through the millstones there are fares fennel fetches hemp seed foxtail and a host of other weeds not to mention pebbles which abound in certain wheat especially in breton wheat
i am not fond of grinding breton wheat any more than long sawyers like to saw beams with nails in them
you can judge of the bad dust that makes in grinding
and then people complain of the flour
they are in the wrong
the flour is no fault of ours
in a space between two windows shower who was seated at table with a landed proprietor who was foxing on a price for some meadow work to be performed in the spring was saying it does no harm to have the grass set
it cuts better
see is a good things ir
it makes no difference with that grass
your grass is young and very hard to cut still
it yields before the iron
etc
cosette was in her usual place seated on the crossbar of the kitchen table near the chimney
she was in rats her bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings destined for the young the barriers
a very young kitten was playing about among the chairs
at intervals the cry of a very young child which was somewhere in the house rang through the noise of the dram shop
it was a little boy who had been born to the thenardier s during one of the preceding winters she did not know why she said the result of the cold and who was a little more than three years old
the mother had nursed him but she did not love him
when the persistent clamor of the next became too annoying your son is equalling the barrier would say so go and see what he wants
bwh
the mother would reply be bothers me
and the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark
x halter ii two complete portraits so far in this book the the barriers have been viewed only in profile the moment has arrived for making the circuit of this couple and considering it under all its aspects
thenardier had just passed his fiftieth birthday madame the barrier was approaching her forties which is equivalent to fifty in a woman so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife
our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this thenardier woman ever since her first appearance tall blonde ex vat angular square enormous and while she belonged as we have said to the race of those colossal wild women who dont let themselves affairs with paving stones hanging from their hair
she did everything about the house made the beds did the washing the cooking and everything else
cosette washer only servant a mouse in the service of an elephant
everything trembled at the sound of her voice window panes furniture and people
her big face dotted with red blotches presented the appearance of a skimmer
she had a beard
she swore splendidly she boasted of being able to crack a nut with one blow other fish
except for the romances which she had read and which made the affected lady peep through the ogress at times in a very queer day the idea would never have occurred to anyone to say of her that is a woman
this thenardier female was like the product of a web chen grafted on a fish wife
when one heard her speak one said that is a gendarme when one saw her drink one said that is a carter when one saw her handle cosette one said that is the hangman
one of her teeth projected when her face was in repose
thenardier was a small thin paid angular bony feeble man who had a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy
his running began her she smiled habitually by way of precaution and was almost polite to everybody even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing
he had the glance of a polecat and the hearing of a man of letters
he greatly resembled the portraits of the abbe de lille
his coquetry consisted in drinking with the carters
no one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk
he smoked a big pile
he wore a blouse and under his blouse an old black coat
he made pretensions to literature and to materialism
there were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying voltaire raynal p army and singularly enough saint augustine
he declared that he had a system
in addition he was a great swindler
a filius o phe philosophe a scientific thief
the species does exist
it will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army he was in the habit of relating with exuberance now being a sergeant in the thor the thought something or other at waterloo he had alone and in the presence of a squadron of death dealing hussars covered with his body and saved from death in the midst of the grapeshot a general who has been dangerously wounded
thence arose for his walk the flaring sign and for hiding the name which it bore in the neighborhood of the cabaret of the sergeant of waterloo
he was a life rama classic and a bonapartist
it was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood
we believe that he had simply studied in holland for an innkeeper
this rascal of composite order was in all probability some fleming from lille in flanders a frenchman in paris a belgian at brussels being comfortably astride of both frontiers
as for his prowess at waterloo the reader is already acquainted with that
it will be perceived that he exaggerated or a trifle
ebb and flow wandering adventure was the leven of his existence a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life and apparently at the stormy epoch of june thenardier belonged to that variety of marauding cutlers of which we have spoken beating about the country selling to some stealing from others and travelling like a family man with wife and children in a rickety cart in the rear of troops on the march with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army
this campaign ended and having as he said some quibus he had come to mont vermeil and setup an inn there
this quibus composed of purses and watches of gold rings and silver crosses gathered in harvest time in furrows down with corpses did not amount to a large total and did not carry this cutler turned saying housekeeper very far
thenardier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which accompanied by an oath recalls the barracks and by a sign of the cross the seminary
he was a fine talker
he allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man
nevertheless the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced improperly
the barrier was cunning greedy slothful and clever
he did not disdain his servants which caused his wife to dispense with them
this giantess was jealous
it seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be an object covered by all
thenardier who was above all an astute and well balanced man was a scamp of a temperate sort
this is the worst species hypocrisy enters into it
it is not that the barrier was not on occasion capable of wrath to quite the same degree as his wife but this was very rare and at such times since he was engaged with the human race in general as before within him a deep furnace of hatred
and since he was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which has befallen them and who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand as a legitimate grievance the sum total of the deceptions the bankruptcies and the calamities of their lives when all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and she she was terrible
woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time
in addition to his other qualities thenardier was attentive and penetrating silent or talkative according to circumstances and always highly intelligent
he had something of the look of sailors who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses
thenardier was a statesman
every newcomer who entered the tavern said on catching sight of madame thenardier there is the master of the house
a mistake
she was not even the mistress
the husband was both master and mistress
she worked he created
he directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action
a word was sufficient for him sometimes a sign the mastodon obeyed
she was possessed of virtues after her own mind if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with monsieur the barrier which was an inadmissible hypothesis by the way she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever
she would never have committed before strangers that mistake so often committed by women and which is called in parliamentary language exposing the crown
that mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot
viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side this was that grand and universal thing the adoration of mind by matter for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty
there was an unknown quantity about thenardier hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman
at certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle at others she felt him like a claw
this woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children and who did not fear anyone except her husband
she was another because she was i am nice to us
but her maternity stopped short with her daughters and as we shall see did not extend to boys
the man had not one thought how to enrich himself
he did not succeed in this
a theatre worthy of this great talent was lacking
the barrier was ruining himself at mont vermeil of ruin is possible to zero in switzerland or in the pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a millionaire human innkeeper must browse where fate has hitched him
it will be understood that the word innkeeper is here employed in a restricted sense and does not extend to an entire class
whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case thenardier was one of those men who understand best with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion that thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized peoples hospitality
besides he was an admirable poacher and quoted for his skill in shooting
he had a certain cold and tranquil laugh which was particularly dangerous
his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes
the duty of the innkeeper he said to her one day violently and in a low voice is to sell to the first come rate as repose light fire dirty sheets a servant life and a smile to stop passersby to empty small purses and to honestly lighten heavy ones to shelter travelling families respectfully to shave the man to pluck the woman to pick the child clean to quote the window open the window shut the chimney corner the armchair the chair the ottoman the stool the featherbed the mattress and the truss of straw to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror and to put a price on it and by five hundred thousand devils to make the traveller pay for everything even for the flies which his dog days
this man and this woman we refuse anfrage wedded a hideous and terrible team
while the husband pondered and combined madame thenardier thought got it absent creditors took no need of yesterday nor of tomorrow and lived in a bit of anger all in a minute
such were these two brings
cosette was between them subjected to their double pressure like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers
cosette ran upstairs and down dad had swept rubbed ducted fan fluttered about panted moved heavy articles and weak as she was aid the coarse work
there was no mercy for her a fierce mistress and venomous master
the ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household
it was something like the fly serving the spiders
the poor child passively held her peace
what takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted god find themselves thus at the very dawn of life very small and in the midst of men all naked
chapter iii men must have wine and horses must have water four new travellers had arrived
cosette was meditating sadly for although she was only eight years old she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of an old woman
cosette was thinking that it was dark very dark that the pitchers and car acres in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern
she was somewhat reassured because no one in the thenardier de tablishment drank much water
thirsty people were never lacking there but their thirst was of the word which applies to the jun rather than to the pitcher
anyone who had asked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men
but there came a moment when the child trembled madame thenardier raised the cover of a stew pan which was boiling on the stove then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern
a thin stream of water trickled from the faucet and half filled the glass
well said she there is no more water
a momentary silence ensued
the child did not breathe
bah
resumes madame thenardier examining the half filled glass this will be enough
cosette applied herself to her work once more but for a quarter of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snowflake
she counted the minutes that passed in this manner and wished it were the next morning
or one must needs be a fat to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour
and cosette trembled
all at once one of the peelers who lodged in the hostelry entered and said in a harsh voice my force has not been watered
yes it has said madame thenardier
i tell you that it has not retorted the peeler
cosette had emerged from under the table
i guess it
said she the horse has had a drink he drank out of a bucket a whole bucketful and it was i who took the water to him and i spoke to him
it was not true cost the lied
i tell you that he has not been watered you little jade
he has a way of blowing when he has had no water which i know well
cosette persisted and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish and which was hardly audible and he drank heartily
cosette crept under the table again
in truth that is fair
said madame thenardier of the beast has not been watered it must be
then glancing about her well now
are you coming
shrieked madame thenardier
cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself
the thenardier resumed mademoiselle xl black name go and water that horse
but madame said cosette feebly there is no water
the thenardier threw the street door wide open well go and get some then
cosette dropped her head and went for an empty bucket which stood near the chimney corner
this bucket was bigger than she was and the child could have set down in it at her face
there never was such a malicious creature as that
i think i should have done better to strain my onions
then she rummaged in a drawer which contained so is pepper and shallots
cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron she took the coin without saying a word and put it in that pocket
then she stood motionless bucketing and the open door before her
she seemed to be waiting for someone to come to her rescue
get along with you
screamed the thenardier
cosette went out
the door closed behind her
chapter iv entrance on the scene of a doll the line of open air booths starting at the church extended as the reader will remember as far as the hostelry of the thenardier s
in compensation not a star was visible in the sky
in the first row and far forwards the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins an immense doll nearly two feet high who was dressed in adobe of pink crepe with gold wheat ears of her head which had real hair and enamel eyes
all that day this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passersby under ten years of age without a mother being found in mont vermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child
eponine and a selma had passed hours in contemplating it and cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it on the sky it is true
at the moment when cosette emerged bucketing and melancholy and overcome as she was she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll towards the lady as she called it
the poor child paused in amazement
she had not yet be held that will close to
the whole shop seemed a palace to her the doll was not a doll it was a vision
it was not splendor riches happiness which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery
with the savage innocents at a city of childhood cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll
she said to herself that one must be a queen of at least a princess to have a thing like that
she gazed at that beautiful pink dress that beautiful smooth hair and she thought how happy that fill must be
she could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall
the more she looked the more dazzled she grew
she thought she was gazing at paradise
there were other folks behind the large one which seemed to her to be fairies and genii
the merchant who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop produced on her somewhat the effect of being the eternal father
in this adoration she forgot everything even the errand with which she was charged
you have not gone
wait
i want to know what you are doing there
get a long you little monster
the thenardier had cast a glance into the street and had caught sight of cosette in her ecstasy
cosette fled dragging her paul and taking the longest strides of which she was capable
chapter v the little one all alone as the thenardier hostelry was in that part of the village which is near the church it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of chelles that cosette was obliged to go for her water
she did not glance at the display of a single other merchant
so long as she was in boulanger land and in the neighborhood of the church the lighted stalls illuminated the road but so on the past light from the last stall vanished
the poor child found herself in the dark
she plunged into it
only as a certain emotion overcame her she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along
this made a noise which afforded her company
the further she went the denser the darkness became
there was no one in the streets
however she did encounter a woman who turned around on seeing her and stood still muttering between her teeth where can that child be going
is it a werewolf child
then the woman recognized cosette
in this manner cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of mont vermeil of the side of chelles
so long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her path she proceeded with tolerable buisness
from time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter this was light and life there were people there and it reassured her
but in proportion as she advanced her pace slackened mechanically said were
when she had passed the corner of the last house cosette paused
it had been hard to advance further than the last stall it became impossible to proceed further than the last house
she set her bucket on the ground thrust her hand into her hair and began slowly to scratch her head a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do
it was no longer moby vermeil it was the open fields
black and desert space was before her
she gazed in despair at that darkness where there was no longer any one where there were feasts where there were spectres possibly
she took a good look and heard the beasts walking on the grass and she distinctly saw spectres moving in the trees
then she seized her bucket again fear had lent her audacity
bah
said she i will tell him that there was no more water
and she resolutely reentered montrer neil
hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she pauses and began to scratch her head again
now it was the thenardier who appeared to her with her hideous hyena mouth and wrath flashing in her eyes
the child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her
what was due to do
what was to become other
where was due to go
in front of her was the spectre of the thenardier behind her all the phantoms of the night and on the forest
it was before the thenardier that she recoiled
she resumed her path to the spring and began to run
she emerged from the village she entered the forest at a run no longer looking at or listening to anything
she only paused intercourse when her breath failed her but she did not halt in her advance
she went straight before her in desperation
as she can she felt like crying
the nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely
she no longer thought she no longer saw
the immensity of night was facing this tiny creature
on the one hand all shadow on the other an atom
coast he knew the way through having gone over it many times on daylight
strange to say she did not get lost
a remnant of instinct guided her vaguely
but she did not turn her eyes either to right or to left for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood
in this manner she reached the spring
it was a narrow natural gas in hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil about two feet deep sure ounces with moss and with those tall crimped grasses which are called henry iv
w brook ran out of it with a tranquil little noise
cosette did not take time to breathe
it was very dark but she was in the habit of coming to this spring
she felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring and which usually served to support her found one of its branches clung to it bent down and plunged the bucket in the water
she was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled
while this bent over she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the spring
the fifteen so i piece fell into the water
cosette neither was not heard it fall
she drew out the bucket nearly full and set it on the grass
that finds he perceived that she was worn out with fatigue
she would have liked to set out again at once but the effort required to fill the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step
she was forced to sit down
she dropped on the grass and remained crouching there
she shut her eyes then she opened them again without knowing why but because she could not do otherwise
the agitated water in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents
overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds which were like masses of smoke
the tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over the child
jupiter was setting in the depths
the child shared with bewildered eyes at this great star with which she was unfamiliar and which terrified her
the planet was in fact very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of most which imparted to its horrible ruddy the
the most gloomily em purples magnifier the star
one would have called it a luminous sound
a cold wind was blowing from the plain
the forest was dark not a leaf was moving there were none of the vague fresh gleams of summer tide
great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise
slender and misshapen bushes whistled in the clearings
the tall grasses undulated like eels under the north wind
the nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished with flaws in search of prey
some bits of dry heather tossed by the breeze blew rapidly by and had the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after
on all sides there were lugubrious stretches
the darkness was bewildering
man requires light
whoever buried himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract
when the eye sees black the heart sees trouble
in an eclipse in the night in the sport opacity there is anxiety even for the stoutest of hearts
no one walks alone in the forest at night without trembling
shadows and trees two formidable densities
a chimerical reality appears in the indistinct depths
the inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness
there are fierce attitudes on the horizon
one inhaled the effluvia of the great black void
one is afraid to glance behind him yet desirous of doing so
the cavities or night things grown haggard taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances obscured is bevel ments irritated tufts livid pools the lugubrious reflected in the funereal the sepulchral immensity of silence unknown but possible being an endings of mysterious branches alarming torsos of trees long handfuls of quivering plants against all this one has no protection
there is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish
this penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child
forests are apocalypses and the beating of the wings of a tiny soul produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault
without understanding her sensations cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature it was no longer terror alone which was gaining possession of her it was something more terrible even than terror she shivered
there are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of her heart here he grew wild she thought she felt that she should not be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow
then by a sort of instinct she began to count aloud one two three four and soon up to ten in order to escape from that singular state which she did not understand but which terrified her and when she had finished she began again this restored her to a true perception of the things about her
her hands which she had set in drawing the water felt cold she rose her terror a natural and unconquerable terror had returned she had but one thought how to flee at full speed through the forest across the fields to the houses to the windows to the lighted candles
her glance fell upon the water which stood before her such was the bright which the thenardier inspired in her that she dared not flee without that bucket of water she seized the handle with both hands she could hardly lift the pail
in this manner she advanced a dozen paces but the bucket was fill it was heavy she was forced to set it on the ground once more
she took breath for an instant then lifted the handle of the bucket again and resumed her march proceeding a little further this time but again she was obliged to pause
after some seconds of repose she set out again
she walked bent forward with dropping head like an old woman the weight of the buckets trained and stiffened berth in arms
the iron handle completed the be numbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands she was forced to halt from time to time and each time that she did so the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs
this took place in the depths of a forest at night in winter far from all human sight she was a child of eight no one but god saw that sad thing at the moment
and her mother no doubt alas
for there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their graves
she panted with a sort of painful rattle so be contracted her throat but she dared not weep so afraid was age of the thenardier even at a distance it was her custom to imagine the thenardier always present
however she could not make much headway in that manner and she went on vatu slowly
in spite of diminishing the length of her stops and of walking as long as possible between them she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to mont vermeil in this manner and that the thenardier would heather
this anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night she was worn out with fatigue and had not yet emerged from the forest
on arriving near an old chestnut tree with which she was acquainted made a last half longer than the rest in order that she might get well rested then she summoned up all her strength picked up her bucket again and courageously resumed her march but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain from crying o my god
my god
at that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer weighed anything at allah and which seemed to her enormous had just seized the handle and lifted it vigorously
she raised her head
a large black form straight and erect was walking beside her through the darkness it was a man who had come up behind her and whose approach she had not heard
this man without uttering a word had seized the handle or the bucket which she was carrying
there are instincts for all the encounters of life
the child was not afraid
this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest houses on that dilapidated border of the faubourg saint marceau
we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter
this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what may be called the well bred mendicant extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness
this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy
he wore a very old and very well brushed roundhay a coarse coat worn perfectly threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles
he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration
he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly white hair his wrinkled brown is livid lips and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life
judging from his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty
the wrinkles on his brow were well placed and would have disposed in his favor anyone who observed him attentively
his lip contracted with a strange food which seemed severe and which was humble
there was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity
in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel cut from some hedge
this stick had been carefully trimmed and had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its units and it had received a coral like head made from red wax it was a cudgel and it seemed to be a cane
there are but few passersby on that boulevard particularly in the winter
the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this without any affectation
at that epoch king louis xviii
went nearly every day to choisy le roi it was one of his favorite excursions
and some rushed forward and others grew up in line for a passing king always creates a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii
produced a certain effect in the streets of paris
it was rapid but majestic
this impotent king had a taste for a fastball up as he was not able to walk he wished to run that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning
he passed pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords
his massive coach all covered with gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered noisily along
there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it
outside of parks he held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees en wrapped in both english gaiters when he reentered the city he put on his hat and saluted rarely he stared solely at the people and they returned it in mind
when he appeared for the first time in the saint marceau quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is the government
thepromenader in the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to this detail
there was no one but himself in this cross lane
he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure though this did not prevent m
le duc de havre from spying him out
m
le duc de hacer as captain of the guard on duty that day was seated in the carriage opposite the king
he said to his majesty yonder is an evil looking man
but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg and as twilight was beginning to call the agent lost trace of him as is stated in a report addresses that same evening tom
when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent of this track here doubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed
at a quarter past four that is to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre of the ports saint martin where the two convicts was being played that day
this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it
this coach set out at half past four
the horses were harnessed and the travellers sub nom de by the coachman were hastily climbing the port huron ladder of the vehicle
the man inquired have you a place
only one beside me on the box said the coachman
i will take it
climb up
are you going as far as lanny
demanded the coachman
yes said the man
the traveller paid to lanny
they started
when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in monosyllables
the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses
the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak
it was cold
the man did not appear to be thinking of that
thus they passed gournay and neuilly sur marne
i get down here said the man
he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle
an instant later he had disappeared
he did not enter the inn
when the coach set out for pagny a few minutes later it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles
the coachman turned to the inside travellers
there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know him
he had not the air of owning as ok but he does not consider money he pays to lanny and he goes only as far as chelles
it is night all the house dates by the spss not enter the inn and he is not to be found
so he has diced through the earth
the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the warm down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the cross road leading to mont vermeil like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before
he followed this road rapidly
at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree bordered road which runs from fanny top army he heard people coming
he concealed himself precipitately in a ditch and there waited until the passersby were at a distance
the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night
not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky
it is at this point that the ascent of the bill begins
the man did not return to the road to mont vermeil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides
once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing stepbystep as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone
there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision
atlas the arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones
he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review
a large tree covered with those excrescences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones
he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts
opposite this tree which was a nash there was a chestnut tree suffering from a peeling of the bark to which a band of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing
he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc
then get rid about for a while on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed
that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest
it was the man who had just met cosette
as he walked through the thicket in the direction of mont vermeil he had espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden of the ground then taking it up and setting out again
he drew near and perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water
then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket
chapter vii cosette side by side with the stranger in the dark cosette as we have said was not frightened
the man accosted her
he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost bass
my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you
cosette raised her head and replied yes sir
give it to me said the man i will carry it for you
cosette let go of the bucket handle
the man walked along beside her
it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth
then he added how old are you little one
eight air
and have you come from far like this
from the spring in the forest
are you going far
the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly so you have no mother
other people have mothers
i have none
and after a silence she went on i think that i never had any
what is your name
said the man
cosette
the man seemed to have received an electric shock
after a moment he inquired where do you live little one
at mont vermeil if you know where that is
that is where we are doing
yes sir
he paused then began again who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest
it was madame thenardier
the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render in different but in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor what does your madame thenardier do
she is my mistress said the child
she keeps the inn
the inn
said the man
well i am going to lodge there tonight
show me the way
we are on the way there said the child
the man walked tolerably fast
cosette followed him without difficulty
she no longer felt any fatigue
from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence
she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven
several minutes elapsed
no sir
are you alone there
yes sir
another pause ensued
cosette lifted up her voice that is to say there are two little girls
what little girls
po nine and selma
this was the way the child simplified the romantic names so dear to the female thenardier
who are po nine and zelma
and what do those girls do
oh
said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in the mall full of affairs
they play they amuse themselves
all day long
yes sir
and you
i
iwork
all day long
the child raised her great eyes in which hung a year which was not visible because of the darkness and replied gently yessir
after an interval of silence she went on sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse myself too
how do you amuse yourself
in the best way i can
they let me alone but i have not many playthings
po mine and selma will not let me play with their dolls
i have only a little lead sword no longer than that
the child held up her tiny finger
and it will not cut
yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies
they reached the village
cosette guided the stranger through the streets
they passed the bakeshop but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch
the man had ceased top of her with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence
when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all the open air booths asked cosette so there is a fair going on here
no sir it is christmas
as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm monsieur
what my child
we are quite near the house
well
will you let me take my bucket now
why
if madame sees that someone has carried it for me she will beat me
the man handed her the bucket
an instant later they were at the tavern door
the door opened
the the barrier appeared with a candle in her hand
ah
the hussy has been amusing herself
the thenardier speedily replaced her grief air by her amiable grimac exchange of aspect common to tavern keepers and eagerly sought the newcomer with her eyes
this is the gentleman
said she
yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat
wealthy travellers are not so polite
she resumed wryly enter my goodman
the good man entered
the thenardier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his frock coat which was absolutely threadbare and to his hat which was a little battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters
the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by a non elation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar
thereupon the thenardier exclaimed am
see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left
put me where you like said the man in the artic in the stable
i will pay as though i occupied a room
for the ous
forty so is agreed
very well then
north sous
said a carter in a low tone to the thenardier woman why the charge is only twenty sous
it is forth in his case retorted the thenardier in the same tone
in the meantime the man lay in this bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at stable on which cissy he made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass
the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself
cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting
the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention
cosette was ugly
if she had been happy she might have been pretty
we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure
cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six
her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping
the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and feels rarely sick people
her hands were as her mother had divine dr lines with chilblains
the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other
her entire clothing was not arab which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter
all she had one a whole ridden linen not a scrap of woollen
her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the thenardier woman had touched her
her naked legs were thin and red
the hollows in her neck were enough to make on sweep
fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and has become what might be called the habit of her body admitting or no possible variation except an increase
in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished hook where terror lurker
her fear was such that on her arrival set as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again
the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon
as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church
had to the time
said the thenardier
the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette
cosette according to her custom whenever the thenardier up lifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table
she had completely forgotten the bread
she had recourse to the expedient of children who love in a constant state of fear
she lied
you should have knocked
i did knock madame
well
he did not open the door
in the meantime give me back my fifteen so i piece
cosette pointed her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green
the fifteen soy piece was not there
at come now said madame thenardier did you hear me
cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing if it
what could have become of that money
the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say
she was petrified
have you lost that fifteen so i piece
screamed the thenardier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it
this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek mercy madame madame
i will not do so any more
the thenardier took down the whip
in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fog of his waistcoat without anyone having noticed his movements
besides the other travel pets were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything
cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half nude limbs
the thenardier raised her arm
perhaps this is it
at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching in the floor for a moment
exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up
and he held out a silver coin to the thenardier
it was not it for it was a twenty so i piece but the thenardier found it to her advantage
cosette returned to what the thenardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before
thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it
by the way would you like some supper
the thenardier inquired of the traveller
he made no reply
he appeared to be absorbed in thought
what sort of a man is that
she muttered between her teeth
will be even pay me for his lodging
in the meantime a door had opened and eponine and a selma entered
they were two really pretty little girls more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tree see the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious next plum proxy and healthy and a delight to the eye
they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquetry of arrangement
there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced
light emanated from these two little beings
besides this they were on the throne
in their toilettes in their gaiety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty
when they entered the thenardier said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration am
there you are you children
then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their robbins a fresh and then releasing them with that gentle manner of shaking off which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are
they went and seated themselves in the chimney corner
they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter
from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air
eponine and a selma did not look at cosette
she was the same as a dog to them
these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other
the folk of the thenardier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed nonetheless admirable to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand
ah
she cried
the stranger turned to the thenardier without quitting his chair
bah madame he said with an almost humid air letter play
such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order
but that a man with such what should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have a will was something which madame thenardier did not intend to tolerate
she retorted with acrimony she must work since she eats
what is she making
the thenardier deigned to reply stockings if you please
stockings for my little girls who have gone so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now
and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them
the thenardier cast a glance of disdain on him
thirty sous at least
will you sell them for five france
went on the man
good heavens
exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five francs
the deuce i should think so
five balls
thenardier thought it time to strike in
yes sir if such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five france
we can refuse nothing to travellers
you must pay on the spot said the thenardier in her curt and peremptory fashion
i will buy that pair of stockings replied the man and he added drawing a five franc piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them
then he turned to cosette
now i own your work play my child
the carter was so much touched by the five franc piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up
he cried examining it
a real mind wheel
and not counterfeit
thenardier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket
the thenardier had no reply to make
she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred
in the meantime cosette was trembling
she ventured to ask is it true madame
mark play
play
said the thenardier in a terrible voice
thanks madame said cosette
and while her mouth thanked the thenardier her whole little soul thanked the traveller
thenardier had resumed his drinking his wife whispered in his ear who can this yellowman be
i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied the barrier in a sovereign manner
cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat
cosette always moved as little as possible
she picked up some old rats and her little leads word from a box behind her
eponine and a selma paid no attention to what was going on
they had just executed a very important operation they had just got hold of the cat
they had thrown their roll on the ground and eponine who was the elder was swathing the little cat in spite of items wing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blues craps
you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other
she twists she cries she is warm
see sister let us play with her
she shall be my little girl
i will be a lady
i will come to see you and you shall look at her
gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you
and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you
mon dieu
little girls are made like that just at present
in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceilings book
thenardier accompanied and encouraged them
as birds maken sets out of everything so children make a fill out of anything which comes to hand
while eponine and a selma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword
that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to pull it to sleep
the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood
while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while seeing little towns and does area and bodices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman
the first child is the continuation of the last roll
a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children
so cosette had made herself a roll out of the sword
madame the merrier approached the yellowman my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m
laffitte there are such queer rich men
she came and wet her elbows on the table
monsieur said she
at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the thenardier had addressed him only as brave homme or bon homme
you see sir she pursued assuming a sweetie hair that was even more repulsive to behold that her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous
you see she has nothing she must needs work
then this child is not yours
demanded the man
oh
mon dieu
no sir
she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child
she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see
we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months
it must be that her mother is dead
qh
said the man and fell into his r every once more
meanwhile the drinkers all three quarters intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spices and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced
the thenardier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter
cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes
she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead
my mother is dead
my mother is dead
on being urged a fresh by the hostess the yellowman the millionaire consented at last to take supper
what does monsieur wish
bread and cheese said the man
decidedly he is a beggar thought madame thenardier
the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing her z
then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half let her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room
madame the barrier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money po nine and selma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her
she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and index made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it
an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms
the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness
no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper
this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour
that pink and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of a selma who said joel on onelook
sister
the two little girls paused in stupefaction cosette had dared to take their doll
eponine rose and without releasing the car she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt
let me alone
said her mother what do you want
mother said the child look there
and she pointed to cosette
cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything
on this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further
cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the will belonging to these young ladies
she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation cosette
cosette started as though the earth had trembled beneath her she turned round
cozart f
repeated the thenardier
cosette took the dill and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair turn without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that are a hearing them then not one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest not the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip not even the sad words which she had heard madame thenardier utter had been able to wring this from her she wrote he burst out sobbing
meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet
what is the matter
he said to the the barrier
well what if it
resumed the man
all this noise for that
said the man well what if she did play with that doll
she touched it with her dirty hands
pursued the thenardier with her frightful hands
he revise these doubled her sobs
will you stop your noise
screamed the thenardier
the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out
as soon as he had gone the thenardier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries
the door opened again the man reappeared he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it up right infront of cosette saying here this is for you
it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his never got that you shop lighted up by fire pits and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop
rosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and his herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall
she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe
the thenardier eponine and a selma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room
madame thenardier petrified and mute recommended her conjectures who is that old fellow
i shea poorman
i shea millionaire
perhaps he is both that is to say a thief
the face of the male thenardier presented that expressive bold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force
the tavern keeper stared alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money
this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning
he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice that machine costs at least thirty france
no nonsense
down on your belly before that man
gross natures have this in common with naive natures that they possess no transition state
cosette ventured to emerge from her hole
the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said thenardier with a caressing air
take it it is yours
cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror
her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy
what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france
it seemed to her that if she touched that will lightning would vary from it
this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the thenardier would scope and heather
nevertheless the attraction carried the day
she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame thenardier may i madame
no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic
parsi
cried the thenardier it is yours
the gentleman has given it to you
truly air
said cosette
is it true
he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should deep
cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the ladys dorchester and began to stare at the floor
we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderately
all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport
i shall call her catherine she said
madame she resumed may i put her on a chair
yes my child replied the thenardier
it was now the turn off logins and a selma to gaze at cosette with envy
cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation
play cosette said the stranger
oh
i am playing returned the child
this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the thenardier hated worse than anyone in the world at that moment
however it was necessary to control herself
habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure
cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms
from time to time the thenardier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said
she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more curious because she dared not utter them aloud
old beast
what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner
to want that little monster to play
to give away forty franc dolls goa made that i would sell for forty sous so i would
a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry
is there any sense in it
is he had then that mysterious old fellow
why
it is perfectly simple replied thenardier if that amused him
it amuses you to have the little one work it amused him to have her play
a travelled can do what he pleases when he pays for it
if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you
if he is an imbecile it does not concern you
what are you worrying for so long as he has money
the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply
the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude
all the other travellers both pre legs and carters had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing
they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe
this poorly dressed man who drew june wheels from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little beats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared
many hours passed
the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the drinking shop was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude
from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned
that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room
the thenardier salons out of politeness and curiosity has remained in the room
is he going to pass the night in that fashion
grumbled the thenardier
do as you like
her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais
a good hour passed thus
the stranger did not stir
thenardier fidgeted coughed so it blew his nose and creamed his chair
is he asleep
thought thenardier
the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse hum
at last thenardier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say is not monsieur going to his repose
not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar
to repose smacked of luxury and respect
these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day
x chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sousa chamber in which one reposes costs twenty france
well
said the stranger you are right
where is your stable
eur
exclaimed the barrier with a smile i will conduct yousif
he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and thenardier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was off see splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico
what is this
said the traveller
if i see all your bridal chamber said the tavern keeper
my wife and i occupy another
this is only entered three or four times a year
i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly
thenardier pretended not to hear this in amiable remark
he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figures on the chimney piece
a very good fire was flickering in the hearth
and what is this
resumed the stranger
the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden
thenardier lied however
when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house
when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared
thenardier had withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning
the innkeeper retired to his room
his wife was in bed but she was not asleep
thenardier replied coldly how you do noon
they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished
as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner
the landlord once gone he threw himself into an armchair and remained for some time buried in thought
then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room hazing about him like a person who is in search of something
he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase
there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child
he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself
this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps
no sheets
this was placed on the floor
in this bed cosette was sleeping
the man approached and gazed down upon her
cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed
in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold
against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark
from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the roll almost convulsively in her arms
beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes
the stranger stepped into it
at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds
they belonged to eponine and a selma
beyond these beds and half hidden stood a nut curtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep
the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the thenardier pair
he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so cold to look at
the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy
eponine and a selma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearth
the traveller bent over them
the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a brand new and shining ten so i piece
the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when farin in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object
he looked at it and recognised a wooden shoes frightful show of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried jud
cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be deceived yet never discouraged had placed here now on the hearthstone also
golf in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing
there was nothing in this wooden shoe
then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf
chapter ix thenardier and his manoeuvres in the following morning two hours at least before daybreak thenardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern prm in hand was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat
his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following him with her eyes
they exchanged not a word
on the one hand there was profound meditation in the other the religious admiration with which one watched the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind
a noise was audible in the house it was the park sweeping the stairs
after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures the married produced the following masterpiece bill of the gentleman in no
supper
france
chamber
candle
fire
service
total
france
service was written service e
twenty three france
cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation
like all great artists thenardier was dissatisfied
pruh
he exclaimed
monsieur thenardier you are right he certainly owes that murmured the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters
it is just buy it is too much
he will not pay it
thenardier laughed boldly as usual and said he will pay
this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and authority
that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so
his wife did not insist
she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room
a moment later he added lowe full fifteen hundred francs
he went and seated himself in the chimney corner meditating with his feet among the war hashes
ah
the monster
she breaks my heart with that doll others
than keep her another day in the house
thenardier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs you will hand that bill to the man
then he went out
hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered
thenardier instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half open door visible only to his wife
the yellowman carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand
up so early
said madame the barrier is monsieur leaving us already
as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails
gerhard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples
to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her
the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absentminded
he replied yes madame i am going
so monsieur has no business in mont vermeil
no i was passing through
that is all
what do i owe you madame he added
the then add jar silently handed him the folded bill
the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere
madame he resumed is business good herein mont vermeil
also monsieur replied the thenardier stupefied af not witnessing another sort of explosion
she continued in a dreary and lamentable ronson
monsieur times are so hard
and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood
all the people are poor you see
if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all
we have so many expenses
just see that child is costing us our very eyes
what child
why the little one you know
cosette the park as she is called hereabouts
ah
said the man
she went on how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames
she has more the air of what than of a lark
you see sir we do not ask charity and we can not bestow it
we earn nothing and we have to pay out a great deal
the license the imposts the door and window tax the hundredths
monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money
and then i have my daughters
the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render in different and in which there lingered a tremor what if one were to rid you other
who
cosette
yes
aj
sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her father and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you
agreed
really
you will take her away
i will take her away
immediately
immediately
call the child
cosette
screamed the thenardier
in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you
how much is it
he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise twenty three france
he looked at the landlady and repeated twenty three france
there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point
the thenardier had had time to prepare herself for the stock
she replied with assurance good gracious yes sir it is twenty three france
the stranger laid five five grams pieces on the table
go and get the child said he
at that moment thenardier advanced to the middle of the room and said monsieur owes twenty six sous
twenty six so is
exclaimed his wife
twenty sous for the chamber resumed thenardier coldly and six sous for his supper
as for the child i must discuss that matters little with the gentleman
leave us wife
madame the barrier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent
she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room
as soon as they were alone thenardier offered the traveller a chair
the traveller seated himself thenardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of good fellowship and simplicity
sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child
the stranger gazed intently at him
what child
thenardier continued how strange it is one grows attached
what money is that
take back your hundreds it piece
i adore the child
whom do you mean
demanded the stranger
eh
our little cosette
are you not intending to take her away from us
well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it
i shall miss that child
i saw her first when she was a tiny thing
it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one other illnesses
she has neither father nor mother
i have brought her up
i have bread enough for her and for myself
in truth i think a great deal of that child
you understand one conceived an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is quick tempered but she loves her also
you see she is just the same as our own child
i want to keep her to babble about the house
the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on the barrier
i am rights minor
but one must find out that
you understand suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good foster father is alive that he is watching over her
in short there are things which are not possible
i do not even know your name
the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the saying goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice monsieur thenardier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from paris
if i take cosette a way i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter
you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is an e my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives
i break the thread which finds her foot and she departs
does that suit you
yes or no
since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs thenardier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person
it was like an intuition be comprehended it with his clear and sagacious promptitude
while drinking with the carters smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician
he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he has been paid for so doing
not a movement not a gesture on the part of the man in the yellow greatcoat had escaped him
even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette thenardier had divined his purpose
who was this man
why this interest
why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse
questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him
he had pondered it all night long
waste her grandfather
then why not make himself known at once
when one has a right one asserts it
this man evidently had no right over cosette
what was it then
thenardier lost himself in conjectures
he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing
he had expected nothing of the sort
his conjectures were put to the rout
get allied his ideas
he weighed everything in the space of a second
the barrier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance
he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that
he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries
sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs
the stranger took from his side pockets hold pocket book of black leather opened it drew out three bank bills which he laid on the table
then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the innkeeper go and fetch cosette
while this was taking place what had cosette been doing
on waking up cosette had run together shoe
in its he had found the gold piece
it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new twenty franc pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath
cosette was dazzled
her destiny began to intoxicate her
she did not know what a good piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it
still she felt that it really washers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear
she was happy above all she was stupefied
such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real
the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her
she trembled vaguely on the presence of this magnificence
the stranger alone did not frighten her
on the contrary be reassured her
ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little childish kind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind
everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest
for the last five years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had shivered and trembled
she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed
formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm
cosette was no longer afraid of the thenardier
she was no longer alone there was someone there
she hastily set about her regular morning duties
that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen sku piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts
she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hamming out of the truth must be told
as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket
it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the thenardier joined her
what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her
cosette she said almost gently come immediately
an instant later cosette entered the public room
the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it
this bundle contained a little woollen town an apron a fustian bodice a kerchiefs petticoat woollen stockings shows a complete outfit for a girl of seven years
all was black
my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly
daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of mont vermeil who had begun to open their doors be held a poorly glad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a link doll in her arms pass along the road to paris
they were going in the direction of live y
it was our man and cosette
no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rats many did not recognize her
cosette was going away
with whom
she did not know
whither
she knew not
all that she understood was that she was leaving the thenardier tavern behind her
no one had thought of bidding her farewell not had she thought of taking leave if anyone
she was leaving that hated and hating house
poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour
cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky
she had put her louis in the pocket other news prom
from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the goodman
she felt something as though she were beside the good god
chapter she who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse madame thenardier had allowed her husband to have his own way as washer wont
she had expected great results
when the man and cosette had taken their departure thenardier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs
is that all
said she
the blowhole
you are right in sooth said he iam a fool
give me my hat
he folded up the three bank bills thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first
some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the park and the man had been seen going in the direct ol not live y
he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the smile that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal
first he gave twenty sous then five france then fifty france then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness
he would have given fifteen thousand francs
but i shall overtake him
and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it
the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of good one must know how to subject them to pressure
all these thoughts whirled through his brain
i am an animal said he
when one leaves mont vermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to live hit can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau
on arriving there be calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child
he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing
he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time
some passersby informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of fanny
he hastened in that direction
they were bar in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country
all at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps
i ought to have taken my gun said me to himself
the barrier was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of the h
it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged
in a calm and even situation thenardier possessed all that is required to make we will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois
at the same time certain circumstances being given certain chicks arriving to bring his under nature to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard
he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some faint of the monster
satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the novel in which thenardier dwelt and have fallen screaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece
after a momentary hesitation bag
he thought they will have time to make their escape
and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridges
the brushwood was not high
thenardier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there
the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible
thenardier was not mistaken
the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat tested
the innkeeper walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of
pardon excuse me sur he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs
so saying he handed the stranger the three bank bills
the man raised his eyes
what is the meaning of this
thenardier replied respectfully it means air that i shall take back cosette
cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man
yes sir i am
i will tell you i have considered the matter
infact i have not the right to give her to you
i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother
it was her mother who confided her time i can only design her to her mother
the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and thenardier be held the pocketbook of bank bills make its appearance once more
the tavern keeper shivered with joy
good
thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me
before opening the pocketbook the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley
the man opened his pocket book once more and drew from it nor the handful of bills which thenardier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the innkeeper saying you are right read
thenardier took the paper and head m
such
march
monsieur thenardier you will deliver cosette to this person
you will be paid for all the little things
i have the honor to salute you with respect fab time
you know that signature
resumed the man
there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten them an added you may keep this paper as your receipt
thenardier retreated intolerably good order
this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go
then he essayed a desperate effort
it is well sir be said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things
a great deal is owing to me
the man rose to his feet fillip ing the dust from his threadbare sleeve monsieur the married in january past the mother reckoned that endowed you one hundred and twenty france
in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march
since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and thirty five france
you had received one hundred t dance too much that makes this hifive x following you
i have just given you fifteen hundred francs
who is this devil of a man
he thought
he did what the wolf does he shook himself
audacity had succeeded with him once
the stranger said tranquilly come cosette
he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground
thenardier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot
the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the innkeeper motionless and speechless
while they were walking away thenardier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists
then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands
i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting
however the innkeeper did not give up
i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow them at a distance
two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fantine and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs
the man led cosette off in the direction of lofty and honey
he walked slowly with drooping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness
the winter had thinned out the forest so that the married did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance
the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed
all at once he caught sight of the harriet
he plunged sudden i j into the brushwood with rosette where they could both hide themselves
the drive
said the barrier and here doubled his pace
the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them
when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled round
it was in vain that the barriers ought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him
the man cast upon him an uneasy glance then elevated his head and continued his course
the innkeeper set out again in pursuit
thus they continued for two or three hundred paces
all at once the man turned round once more he saw the innkeeper
this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that thenardier decided that it was useless to proceed further
thenardier retraced his steps
chapter xi number reappears and cosette wins it in the lottery jean valjean was not dead
when he fell into the sea or rather when he threw himself into it he was not ironed as we have seen
he swam underwater until he reached a vessel at anchor to which a boat was moored
he found means of hiding himself in this boat until night
at night he swam off again and reached the shore a little way from cape brun
there as he did not lack money be procured clothing
a small country house in the neighborhood of bala guide was at that time the dressing room of escaped convicts a lucrative specialty
then jean valjean like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary
he found his first refuge at pradesh a near be ausser
then he directed his course towards grand village near briancon in the hautes alpes
later on some trace of his passage into aim in the territory of five jeux was discovered in the pyrenees at addons at the spot called grange we do umec near the market of cha dailies and in the environs of perigueux at bruno e s canton of la chapelle to nanuet
he reached paris
we have just seen him at montrer mail
his first care in arriving in paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl or from seven to eight years of age them to procure a lodging
that done he had be taken himself to monte dr neil
it will be remembered that already during his preceding escape he had made a mysterious trip thinner or some wherein that neighborhood of which the law had gathered an inkling
however he was thought to be dead and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him
at paris one of the journals which chronicles the fact fell into his hands
he felt reassured and almost at peace as though he had really been dead
on the evening of the day when jean valjean reached cosette from the class of the thenardier she returned to paris
here entered it at nightfall with the child by way of the barrier monceau x
there he entered a cabriolet which took him to the esplanade of the observatoire
the day had been strange and filled with emotions for cosette
they had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns behind hedges they had changed carriages frequently they had travelled short distances on foot
she made no complaint but she was weary and jean valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked
he took her on his back
book fourth
it was no longer solitude for there were passersby it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets bad guys like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty
what was it then
it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was someone it was a boyle care of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery
it was the old quarter of the marches us chevaux
the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this march eaux chevaux if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du petit banquo we after leaving on his fight a garden protected by high walls then a field in which gambaro mills rose like gigantic beaver hits then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then along low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters post nobilis this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des vignes saint marcel
there near a factory and between two garden walls there could be seen at that epochs mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched novel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral
it presented its side and table to the public road hence its apparent diminutive news
nearly the whole of the house was hidden
only the door and one window could be seen
this novel was only one story high
the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a novel while the window of it had been far far out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion
the door was nothing but a collection of work eaten plan is roughly bound together by crossbeams which resembles roughly new blogs
it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky plaster stained dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls
the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrow scantling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which serves both as wicket and air hope when the door was closed
on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scantling the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated
where was one
above the door of said number the inside replied no number
no one knows what dust colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening
the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a frame in large square pages only these large pages were suffering from various sounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage
and the blinds dislocated and in pasted threatened passersby rather than screened the occupants
the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter
this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus be held on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different moens beneath the same rate the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman
the staircase led to a very fast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a mouse
this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of ver new dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and gather more like stalls than cells
these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood
all this was dark disagreeable sam melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the door or in the door by cold days or by icy wind s
an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders
to the left of the entrance door on the boulevard side at about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walked up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by
a portion of this building has recently been demolished
from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was informed days
as a while it was not over a hundred years old
a hundred years is youth in a church and are in a house
the post men called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the goffeau house
let us explains hence this appellation was derived
collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a link now that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the chatelet named one corbeau raven the other regard fox
the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine
the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it
bonjour
etc
the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the nests and finding the hearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king
their petition was presented to louis xv
the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly so
by the kings command maitre corbeau was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself for beau
maitre regard was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a pin front of his rand to call himself l regard so that the second name bore almost as much resemblance as the first
he was even the author of the monumental window
hence the edifice bore the name of the goffeau house
opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was three quarters dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriers des gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris
an odor of copper as issued in puffs from the roots of the neighboring factory
the barrier was close at hand
in the city wall was still in existence
this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind
it was the road to bicetre
it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death reentered paris on the day of their execution
it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been in riddles
make a few steps and you come upon that fatal the croyle barbeque gehlbach stabbed the goat girl of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas
a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable poll added elms of the barriers saint jacques that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a shop keeping and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur not to uphold it with authority
leaving aside this place saint jacques which was as it were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even today is so unattractive where stood the building number
bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty five years later
the place was unpleasant
in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the salpetriere a glimpse of whose some could be seen and bicetre whose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men
as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood novels rubbish ancient walls blackened like vere cloths new white walls like winding sheets everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings erected on a line flat constructions long cold rows and the melancholy sadness of right angles
not an unevenness of the ground not a captive in the architecture not a fold
the ensemble was glacial regular hideous
nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry
it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief
despair yarns
something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored
nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight us vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing them selves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful
the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite
the passerby can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet
the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it
one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly on the evening melancholy by night it was sinister
in summer at twilight one saw here and there a few old women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain
these good old women were fond of begging
however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation
even at that time anyone who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste
each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing
for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does today
wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city
it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of terms trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring for that the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous hordes of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire
the old houses crumble and new ones rise
since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the salpetriere the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the moats saint victor and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach to acres and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the fight and the left for there are things which are off when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarged streets
the symptoms of a new life are evident
in this old provincial quarter in the wildest books the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians
chapter ii and step rowlands warbler it was in front of this for beau house that jean valjean halted
like wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his next
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket grew out a sort of a parsley opened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette
at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door
the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor stable and several chair was to be in which a fire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner
a lantern on the boulevard cast a vague light unto this poor room
at the extreme end there was a dressing room with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her
he struck a match and lighted a candle
the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was and continued to sleep without knowing where she was
nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep
the same ear piercing religious sentiment filled his heart
it was broad daylight and the child still slept
as an day of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade
yes madame
cried cosette waking with a start here i am
here i am
and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half suit with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall
ah
mon dieu my broom
said she
she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean
ah
so it is true
said the child
good morning monsieur
children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being themselves by nature you and happiness
cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean
where was she
was paris very large
was madame thenardier very far away
was and to go back
etc
etc
all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here
it was a frightful hole but she felt free
must i sweep
she resumed a flash
play
said jean valjean
the day passed this
cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man
some new thing had come into his soul
jean valjean had never loved anything for twenty five years he had been alone in the world
he has never been father loved his hand friend
in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy
the heart of that ex convict was full of virginity
human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss
when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him
all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child
he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy
he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing
poor old man with a perfectly new heart
only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light
it was the second white apparition which he had encountered
the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise of his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise
the early days passed in this dazzled state
cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing
she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her
like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded
all had repulsed her they menard legs their children other children
she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her
it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cllr
it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked a law
it was the possibility
thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kingman
she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of expansion
the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the novel pretty
these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy
the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here
nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on a garret
we all have in our past a delightful garret
natures difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf
destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences suffering image alike in sorrow
one in fact completed the other
to meet was to find each other
at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together
when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to eachother and embraced each other closely
and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping here in the dark was not an illusion but a reality
the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god
moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well
there he seemed perfectly secure
the chamber with a dressing room which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard
the ground floor of numbers sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a wagon house for market gardeners and no communication existed between it and the first story
it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps not stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were
it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of port fees who had let him the lodging on christmas eve
he had represented himself to her as a gentleman of means who had been ruined my spanish bonds who was so mind there to live with his little daughter
he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room as we have seen
it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival
week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that novel
cosette laughed shattered and sang from daybreak
children have their morning song as well as birds
it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chilblains and kissed it
the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion
at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown
cosette was no longer in tags she was in mourning
she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life
jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read
sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison
this idea has ended in teaching a child to read
then the ex convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels
he felt in its premeditation from on night he will of someone who was not man and he became absorbed in revert
good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones
and then he talked of her mother and he made us today
she called him father and knew no other name for him
he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle
life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and must be no longer reproached anyone in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him
he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light
the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts
at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly
this is only a personal opinion but route at our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well doing
he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fantine and public authority as personified in us bert
he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaffed fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were over lowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim
who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the end of growing discouraged and of falling once more
he loved and grew strong again
alas
he walked with no less in decision than cosette
he protected her and she strengthened him
thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue
oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny
chapter iv the remarks of the principal tenant jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day
every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at night fall
he liked to go to saint medard which is the nearest church
she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous here at eyes with catherine
he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her
it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person
the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market
they lived soberly always having a little five buy like people in very moderate circumstances
he still wore his yellow xpath is black breeches and his old hat
in the street he was taken for a poor man
it sometimes happened that kind hearted woman turned back to bestow a sou on him
jean valjean accepted the sky with a deep now
it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking aims then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his band often a silver coin and walked rapidly away
this had its disadvantages
he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alms
the old principal lodger across looking creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact
she was a little feat which rendered her talkative
there remained to her from her past two teeth one above the other below which she was continually knocking against each other
she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from mont vermeil
one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the novel
she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him
jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security no doubt
the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded
the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a bank bill for a thousand francs
it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence
she fled in alarm
a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this thousand franc bill changed for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before
where
thought the old woman
the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises
that thousand brand note commented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes saint marcel
a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his shirt sleeves in the corridor
the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order
she was alone
cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed
the old woman caught sight of the cost hanging on a nail and examined it
the lining has been sewed up again
the good woman be profit carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and refers thicknesses of paper
more thousand franc bank bills no doubt
she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets
not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big pocketbook a very large knife and a suspicious circumstances ederal wigs of various colors
each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents
thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last days of winter
he never passed this man without giving him a few sous
sometimes he spoke to him
those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police
he was an ex beadle of seventy five who was constantly mumbling his prayers
one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern which had just been lighted
the man seemed engaged in prayer according to his custom and was much bent over
jean valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary aims in his hand
the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly stared intently at jean valjean then dropped his head quickly
this movement was like a flash of lightning
jean valjean was seized with a shudder
it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle bit of a well known and startling face
here coiled terrified petrified dating neither to breathe to speak to remain not to view staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a rag and no longer appears who know that he was there
at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of self preservation restrained jean valjean from uttering a word
the beggar had the same figure the same rate the same appearance as he had every day
bah
said jean valjean i am mad
i am dreaming
impossible
and he returned profoundly troubled
he hardly dared to confess even to himself that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert
that night on thinking the matter over be regretted not having questioned the man in order to force him to raise his head a second time
on the following day at nightfall he went back
the beggar was w this post
good day my goodman said jean valjean resolutely handing him as ok
the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice thanks my goods or
it was unmistakably the way earle
jean valjean felt completely reassured
he began to laugh
how the deuce could i have thought that i saw have rtf here
he thought
ami going to lose my eyesight now
and he thought no more about it
this struck him as singular
the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself always went to bed at nightfall so that she might not burn out her candles
jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet
he heard someone ascending the stairs
jean valjean listened
the step was heavy and sounded like that of a man but the old woman word about shore and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman
nevertheless jean valjean blew out his candle
he had sent cosette to bed saying to her in a low voice get into bed very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused
jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back towards the door seated on the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his breath in the dark
after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he heard nothing more and as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber he saw a light through the keyhole
this light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall
there was evidently someone there who was holding a candle in his hand and listening
several minutes elapsed this and the light retreated
but he heard no sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes
jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could not close his eyes all night
at daybreak just as he was falling into a dose through fatigue he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening
the step was approaching
he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole which was tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door as he passed
the man was of lofty stature clad in a long frock coat with a cudgel under his arm
the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert
jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening of the boulevard but he would have been obliged to open the window he dared not
it was evident that this man had entered with a key and like himself
who had given him that key
what was the meaning of this
the good woman appeared as usual
as she swept up she remarked to him possibly monsieur may have heard someone come in last night
that is true by the way he replied in the most natural to be possible
who was it
it was a new lodger who has come into the house said the old woman
and what is his name
and who is this monsieur dumont
the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered a gentleman of property like yourself
perhaps she had no ulterior meaning
jean valjean though the perceived one
when the old woman had taken her departure he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in his pocket
in spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silvera hundreds ou piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily in the floor
when darkness came on he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard
he saw no one
the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted
it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees
he went upstairs again
come
he said to cosette
he took her by the hand and they both went out
book fifth
for a black hung a mute pack chapter i the zigzags of strategy an observation here becomes necessary in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on
the author of this book a no regrets the necessity of mentioning himself has been absent from paris for many years
paris has been transformed since he quitted it
a new city has arisen which is after a fashion unknown to him
in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he hideaway religiously in his memory is now apar is it days gone by
he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed
it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and cats in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality
readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble
for his own part he is unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him
it is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanish sr
so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are a matter of indifference to you that those windows those roots and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones
later on when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to you that you miss those foods those doors and that those walls are necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements
all those places which you no longer behold which you may never behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on a melancholy charm recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother
may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present
that said weber the reader to take note of it and we continue
jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed
illustration the black hunt by lack hunt this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted star
on soil where an imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other advantages that of receiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing them on the wrong scent
i mcenery this is called false reimb ishment
the moon was bulk that night
jean valjean was not sorry for this
the moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets
jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light wide
he did not perhaps take sufficiently into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him
still in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue police au he thought he felt certain that no one was following him
cosette walked on without asking any questions
the sufferings of the first six years of her life has instilled something passive into her nature
moreover and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur she had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this goodman and to the freaks of destiny
and then she was with him and she felt safe
jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette
he trusted in god as she trusted in him
it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of someone greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible
however he had no settled idea no plan no project
he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and then it might have been javert with our javert knowing that he was jean valjean
was not be disguised
was not he believed to be dead
still queer things had been going on for several days
he wanted no more of them
he was determined not to return to the forbes u house
like the wild animal chased from its pair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell
there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter one finding nothing which suited him
he had no doubt that if anyone had chances to be upon his track they would have lost it
a few moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round
the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious
come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise
at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollin stands today and where the rue neuve sainte genevieve turns off
it is understood of course that the rue neuve sainte genevieve is an old street and that a posting chaise does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years
in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters and its real name is the despots
the moon cast a livid light into this open space
jean valjean went into an bush in a doorway calculating that of the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed this illuminated space
in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance
there were four of them now
all we get all dressed in long browncoats with round hats and june cudgels in their hands
their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sin is here tried through the darkness
one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois
they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group like men in consultation
they had an air of indecision
the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy
at the moment when the first man wheeled round the moon fell fill in his face
jean valjean recognized javert perfectly
he took advantage of their hesitation
it was time lost for them but gained for him
he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself and went down the rue des postes towards the region of the jardin des plantes
cosette was beginning to be tired
he took her in his arms and carried her
there were no passersby and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of there being a moon
here doubled his pace
at our tenant le coeur d encre scared aux
he left behind him the rue de la clef then the fountain saint doctor skirted the jardin des plantes by the lower streets and reached the quay
there he turned round
the quay was deserted
the streets were deserted
there was no one behind him
he drew a long breath
tools were still collected there at that epoch
he presented him self at the toll office and handed over a sou
it is two sous said the old soldier in charge of the bridge
you are carrying a child who can walk
pay for two
he paid vexed that his passage should have aroused remark
every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away
a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself and on its way like him to the right bank
this was of use to him
he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart
towards the middle of the bridge cosette whose feet were benumbed wanted to walk
he set her on the ground and took her hand again
the bridge once crossed he perceived some timber yards on his right
he directed his course thither
in order to reach them it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large unsheltered and illuminated space
he did not hesitate
those who were on how track had evidently lost the scent and jean valjean believed himself to be out of danger
hunter yes followed mo
a little street the eye duchemin very saint antoine opened out between two timber yards enclosed in walks
this street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly for him
before entering it be cast a glance behind him
four shadows were just entering on the bridge
these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were on their way to the right bank
these four shadows were the four men
jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured
in whole remained to him it was that the men had not perhaps stepped on the bridge and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space holding cosette by the hand
in that case by plunging into the little street before him he might escape if he could reach the timber yards the marshes the market gardens the uninhabited ground which was not build upon
it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street
he entered in
chapter iii to wit the plan of paris in three hundred paces further on he arrived at a point where the street forked
it separated into two streets which ran in a slanting line one to the right and the other to the left
jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of ay
which should be choose
he did not hesitate but took the one on the right
why
because that to the left ran towards a suburb that is to say towards inhabited regions and the right branch towards the open country that is to say towards deserted regions
however they no longer walked very fast
he took her up and carried her again
cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the goodman and said not a word
he turned round from time to time and looked behind him
he took care to keep always on the dark side of the street
the street was straight in his rear
the first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing the silence was profound and he continued his march somewhat be assured
all at once on turning round he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through far off in the obscurity something which was moving
he rushed forward precipitately rather than walked hoping to find some side street to make his escape through it and thus to break his scent once more
he arrived at a wall
this wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress it was a wall which borders da transverse street in which the one he had taken ended
here again he was obliged to come to a decision should he go to the right or to the left
he glanced to the right
the fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns then ended at a blind alley
the extremity of the culdesac was distinctly visible a lofty white wall
he glanced to the left
on that side the land was open and about two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent
on that side lay safety
at the moment when jean valjean was meditating a turn to the left in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the land he perceived a sort of motionless black statue at the corner of the land and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps
it was someone a man who had evidently just been posted there and who was barring the passage and waiting
jean valjean recoiled
the point of paris where jean valjean found himself situated between the faubourg saint antoine and lara pee is one of ttp se which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom resulting in disfigurement according to come and in a transfiguration according to others
the market gardens the timber yards and the old bull wings have been defaced
today there are brand new wide streets arenas circuses hippodrome c railway stations and a prison max as there progress as the reader sees with its antidote
half a century ago in that ordinary popular tongue which is all compounded of traditions which persists in calling the institut les quatre nations and the opera comique feydeau the precise spot whither jean valjean had arrived was called le petit pic pic
the memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past
le petit pic pic which moreover hardly ever had any existence and never was more than the outline of a quarter had nearly the monkish aspect of a spanish town
the roads were not much paved the streets were not much built up
with the exception of the two or three streets of which we shall presently speak all was wall and solitude there
gardens convents timber yards matches occasional lowly dwellings and great wall was high as the houses
such was this quarter in the last century
the revolution snubbed it soundly
the republican govern ment demolished and cut through it
rubbish shoots were established there
thirty years ago this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings
today it has been utterly blotted out
the petit pic pic of which no existing plan has preserve way race is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of published at paris by denis thierry rue saint jacques opposite the rue du plates and at lyons by jeannie in the mercier eat the sign of prudence
petit pic pic had as we have just mentioned ay of streets formed by the rue du chem invert saint antoine which spread out in two branches taking on the left the name of little pic pussy feet and on the right the name of the rue po ponceau
the two limbs if they were connected at the apex ad by a far this bar was called the droit mur
the rue po ponceau ended the red le petit pic pic passed on and ascended towards the lenoir market
a person coming from the seine reached the extremity of the displ ponceau and had on his right the rue de kit mug turning abruptly at a right angle in front of him the wall of that street and on his rights truncated prolongation of the rue de kit mug which had no issue and was called the culdesac gene of
it was here that jean valjean stood
as we have just said on catching sight of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the rue de kit mug and the rue let it pic pushed e coiled
there could be no doubt of it
that phantom was lying in wait for him
what was metodo
the time for retreating was passed
that which he had perceived in movement an instant before in the distant darkness was javert and his squad without a doubt
javert was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end jean valjean stood
javert to all appearances was acquainted with this little labyrinth and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit
he examined the culdesac gen got there he was cut off
he examined the rue petit pic pic there stood a sentinel
jean valjean felt himself caught asin cnet which was slowly contracting he gazed heavenward in despair
chapter iv the groping soft light in order to understand what follows it is requisite to form an exact idea of the droit kurland and in particular of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue pol once akin to this page
droit kurland was almost entirely bordered on the right as far as the rue petit pic pushy houses of me an aspect on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the rue petit pic pussies so that this building which was very lofty on the rue petit pick us side was tolerably low on the side adjoining the fuel oil ncea u
there at the angle of which we have spoken it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall
this wall did not a bit directly on the street it formed a deeply retreating niche concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been one in the ruf po ponceau the other in the rue de kit mug
beginning with these angles of the niche the wall extended along the rue po ponceau as far as choose which bore the number and along the rue de kit mug where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose table of intersected thus forming another retreating angle in the street
this table was sombre of aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed
the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the kind of old inhabitants of the quarter
the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door it was a vast formless assemblage of perpendicular plan is the upper ones being broader than the lower bound together by long transverse strips of iron
at one side there was a carriage rate of the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously
a linden tree showed its crest above the niche and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the rue po ponceau
in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him
he ran his eyes rapidly over if he said to himself that if he could contrive to get inside it he might save himself
guest he conceived an idea then shops
in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue de kit mug side there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead
the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front
these ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless find stocks which writhe over the fronts of old farm houses
this odd espalier with its branches of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean
he seated cosette with her back against a stone post with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement
perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house
but the pipe was dilapidated and past service and hardly hung to its fastenings
moreover all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars even the attic windows in the roof
and then the moon fell full upon that facade and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing
and finally what was to be done with cosette
how was due to be drawn up to the top of a three story house
he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain pipe and crawled along the wall to get back into the rue po ponceau
when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette he noticed that no one could see him there
as we have just explained he was concealed from all eyes no matter from which direction they were approaching besides this he was in the shadow
finally there were two doors perhaps they might be forced
the wall above which he saw the linden tree and the ivy evidently a butter on a garden where he could at least hide himself although there were as yet no leaves on the trees and spend the remainder of the night
time was passing he must act quickly
he felt over the carriage door and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in
he approached the other door with more hope it was frightfully decrepit its very immensity rendered it less solid the planks were rotten the iron bands there were only three of them were rusted
it seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this work eaten barrier
on examining it be found that the door was not a door it had neither hinges crossbars locknote issues in the middle their on bands traversed it from side to side without any break
through the crevices in the plank she caught a view of un means labs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together which passersby might still have seen there ten years ago
he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed
chapter v which would be impossible with gas lanterns at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance
jean valjean risked a glance found the corner of the street
seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just de boucher into the tiepolo gc exh
he saw the gleam of their bayonets
they halted frequently it was plain that they were searching all the books of the walls and all the embrasures of the doors and alleys
this was some patrol that is very had encountered there would be no mistake as to this surmise and whose aid he had demanded
at the rate at which they were marching and in consideration of the halts which they were making it would make them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood
it was a frightful moment
a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time
and the valley snow meant not only the galleys but cosette lost to him forever that is to say a life resembling the interior of a tomb
there was but one thing which was possible
he rummaged in the one of the other according to circumstances
among his other resources thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at toulon he was as it will be remembered a past master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder of climbing irons by sheer muscular force by leaning on the nape of his neck his shoulders his hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story of need be an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the conciergerie of paris by which batte molle condemned to death made his escape twenty years ago
jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden it was about eighteen feet in height
the angle which it formed with the table of the large building was filled at its lower extremity by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passersby
this practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in paris
this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet
the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping
cosette was the difficulty for she did not know how to climb a wall
should be abandon her
jean valjean did not once think of that
it was impossible to carry her
the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him down cards
a rope would have been required jean valjean had none
where waste to get a rope at midnight in the rue po ponceau
certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment
all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate is
at that epoch there were no gaskets in the streets of paris
at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were ascended and descended by means of a rope which traverses the street from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post
the pulley over which this role ran was fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box the key to which was kept by the lamplighter and the food itself was protected by a metal case
jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the streets to be bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more
he had a rope
these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when rn share fighting at aim at fatality
we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night
the lantern in the culdesac gene it was this naturally extinct like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place
any other child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before
she commented herself with plucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat
father said she in a very low voice i am afraid
who is coming yonder
bush
replied the unhappy man it is madame thenardier
cosette shuddered
he added say nothing
if you cry out if you weep the thenardier is lying in wait for you
she is coming to make you back
half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall
cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word
she obeyed
and she felt herself lifted from the ground
before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall
jean valjean grasped her out he got his back took her two tiny hands in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as the cant
as he had guessed there stood a building whose root started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle slope which grazed the linden tree
a lucky circumstance for the walls as much higher on this side than on these rear side
jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him
he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol
the thundering voice of javert was audible search the blind alley
ther le droit muris guarded
so is the rue petit lisp us
the soldiers rushed into the negro talley
jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the line entree and leaped to the ground
whether from terror of courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her hands were a little abraded
chapter vi the beginning of an enigma jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very fast and of singular aspect one of those melancholy gardens which week made to be looked at in winter and at night
this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corners and an unshaded space in the centre where could be seen a very large solitary tree then several fruit trees gnarled and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well
here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with moss
the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs
the grass had half taken possession of them and a green mould covered the west
jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent a pile of favors and behind the fagots directly against the walls stone statue whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which looked vaguely through the gloom
the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were distinguishable one of which much eucumbene f seemed to serve as a shed
the large building of the rjr droit mur which had a song on the due petit pic pic turned two facades at right angles towards this garden
there interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior
all the windows were grated
not a gleam of light was visible at any one of the k
the upper story had scuttles like prisons
one of those facades cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense black pall
no other house was visible
the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness
nevertheless walls could be confusedly made out which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond and the low roofs of the tiepolo ncaa u
nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined
there was no one unit which was quite natural in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this spot were made for anyone to walk in even in broad daylight
a man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden
the child whose thoughts were still on the thenardier shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible
cosette trembled and pressed close to jim
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy road were becoming more distant
jean valjean held his breath
however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this frightful uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving
it seemed as though those walls had been built on the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak
all at once in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound arose a sound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been horrible
this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden
at the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom
cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees
they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they just knew i
these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeking to be deserted
it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house
while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing
he no longer be held the night he beheld a blue sky
it seemed to him that he felt those songs which we all have within us unfolding
the song died away
it may have lasted a long time
jean valjean could not have told
hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment
all fell silent again
there was no longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden
that which had menaced that which had reassured him all had vanished
the freeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the walk and they gave out a faint sweet melancholy sound
poor cosette said nothing
as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep
he bent down and looked at her
she was still trembling
are you sleepy
said jean valjean
i am very cold she replied
a moment later she resumed is she still there
who
said jean valjean
madame thenardier
jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make cosette keep silent
ah
said he she is gone
you need fear nothing further
the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast
the ground was damp the shed open on all sides the breeze grew more keen every instant
the good man took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette
are you less cold now
said he
oh yes father
well wait for me a moment
i will soon be back
he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building seeking a better shelter
he came across doors but they were closed
there were bars at all the windows of the ground floor
just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived a light
he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows
they all opened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up by arcades and pillars where only a highlight and great shadows were visible
the light came from a taper which was burning in one corner
the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it
nevertheless by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding sheet and which resembled a human form
this form was lying face downward to wy on the pavement with the arms extended in the form of a cross in the immobility of death
one would have said judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor that this sinister form had a rope round its neck
the whole chamber was bathed in that most of places which are sparely illuminated which adds to horror
jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life he had never be held anything more blood curdling and terrible than that enigmatical form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and be held this at night
it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive
he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move
in spite of his remaining this what seemed to him a very long time the put stretched form made no movement
all at once he felt himself over powered by an inexpressible terror and he fled
he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him
it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that form following him with great strides and waving its arms
he reached the ruin all out of breath
his knees were giving way beneath him the perspiration was pouring from him
where waste
who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of paris
what was this strange house
an edifice full of nocturnal mystery calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels and when they came offering them abruptly that terrible vision promising to open the radiant portals of heaven and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb
and it actually was an edifice a house which bore a number on the street
it was not a dream
he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact
cold anxiety uneasiness the emotions of the night had given him a genuine fever and all these ideas were flashing together in his brain
he stepped up to cosette
she was asleep
chapter viii the enigma becomes doubly mysterious the child had laid her head on a stone and fallen asleep
he sat down beside her and began to think
little by little as he gazed at her he grew calm and we gained possession of his freedom of mind
he clearly perceived this truth the foundation of his life henceforth that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her
he was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his boat to cover her
nevertheless athwart this revert into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar to use
it was like the tinkling of a bell
this sound proceeded from the garden
it could be heard distinctly though faintly
it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures
this noise made valjean turn round
he looked and saw that there was someone in the garden
a being resembling a man was walking amid the bell glasses of the melon beds rising stopping halting with regular movements as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground
this person appeared to link
jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy
for them everything is hostile and suspicious
they distrust the day because it enables people to see them and the night because it aids in surprising them
a little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted and now he shivered because there was someone there
he fell back from chimerical terror store alt errors
he said to himself that have stand the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up
he took the sleeping code the gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed
cosette did not stir
from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch
when the man approached the sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated it be made any nasty gestures tremolo accompanied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased
it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify
who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a dakota box
they were icy cold
ah
gold box
he cried
he spoke to her in a low voice cosette
she did not open her eyes
he shook her vigorously
she did not wake
issue read
he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to boot
the most frightful thoughts rushed pell hell through his mind
there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of duties and violently force the partitions of our brains
when those we love are in question our prudence invents every sort of madness
he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal
cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement
he listened to her breathing she still breathed but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction
how waste to warn her back to life
how waste to rouse her
all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts
he rushed wildly from the ruin
it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and besides fire in less than a quarter of an hour
chapter ix the man with the bell he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden
he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat
in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him
jean valjean accosted him with the cry one hundred francs
the man gave a start and raised his eyes
you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean if you will grant me shelter for this night
what
so it is you father madeleine
said the man
that name thus pronounced at that obscure hole in that unknown spot by that strange man made jean valjean start back
he had expected anything but that
the person who thus addressed him was agent and lame old man dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his left knee a leather kneecap when crying a moderately large bell
his face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable
however the goldman had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all over at good god
how come you here father madeleine
where did you enter
risk jesus
did you fall from heaven
there is no trouble about that if ever you did all it will be from there
and what a state you are in
you have no cravat you have not at you have no cost
do you know you would have frightened anyone who did not know you
no cost
lord god
are the saints going mad nowadays
but how did you get in here
his word stumbled over each other
the goodman talked with a rustic volubility in which there was nothing alarming
all this was uttered with a mixture of stupefaction and naive kindliness
who are you
and what house is this
demanded jean valjean
ah
larrieu this is too much
exclaimed the old man
i am the person for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had me placed
what
no said jean valjean and how happens if that you know me
you saved my life said the man
he turned
a day of moonlight outlines his profile and jean valjean recognized old raychel event
ah
said jean valjean so it is you
yes i recollect you
that is very lucky said the old man in a reproachful tone
and what are you doing here
resumed jean valjean
why i am covering my melons of course
in fact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old raichel event held in his hand the end of a straw hat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed
during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them
it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean
what if i were to put my melons into their great coats
you ought to have done the same
but how do you come here
jean valjean finding himself known to this man at least only under the name of madeleine thenceforth advanced only with caution
he multiplied his questions
strange to say their roles seemed to be reversed
it was he the intruder who interrogates
and what is this bell which you wear on your knee
this replied raychel event is so that i may be avoided
what
so that you may be avoided
old raychel event winked with an indescribable air
am goodness
there are only women in this house many young girls
it appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet
the bell gives them warning
when i come they go
what house is this
come you know well enough
but i do not
not when you got me the place here as gardener
answer me as though i knew nothing
well then this is the petit pic pic convent
memories recurred to jean valjean
chance that is to say providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier saint antoine where old rauch do event crippled by the fall from his cart had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously
he repeated as though talking to himself the petit pic pic convent
exactly returned old raychel event
but to come to the point how the reuse did you manage to get in here you father madeleine
no matter if you are a saint you are a man as well and no man enters here
you certainly are here
there is no one but me
still said jean valjean i must stay here
ah good god
cried raychel event
jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in a grave voice father rauch eleven to saved your life
i was the first to recall it returned gauche le vent
well you can do today for me that which i did for you in the olden days
at length he exclaimed of
that would be a blessing from the good god if i could make you some little return for that
save your life
monsieur lemaire dispose of the old man
a wonderful you had transfigured this old man
his countenance seemed to emit a day of light
what do you wish me to do
he resumed
that i will explain to you
you have a chamber
i have an isolated novel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent in a former which no one ever looks into
there are three rooms in ir
the hut was in fact so well hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived it
good said jean valjean
now i am going to ask two things of you
what are they kr
mayor
in the first place you are not to tell anyone what you know about us
in the second you are not to try to find out anything more
as you please
and then moreover you it was who placed me here
that concerns you
i am at your service
that is settled then
now come with me
we will go and get the child
au
said raychel event so there is a child
he added not a word further and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master
jean valjean had put on his cravat and so at once more his hat which he had flung over the wall had been found and picked up
while jean valjean was putting on his coat gauche p event has removed the bell and knee cap which now hung on an all besides vintage basket that adorned the wall
father madeleine
that is bad
but they remember you
you are an in grade
chapter x which explains how javert got on the scent the events of which we have just be held the reverse side so to speak had come about in the simplest possible manner
shrm
the police had supposed that he had be taken himself to paris
paris is a karla from where everything is lost and everything disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea
no forest hides a man as does that crowd
fugitives of every sort know this
they go to paris as to an abyss there are rules which save
the police know it also and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere
they sought the ex mayor of m
shrm
javert was summoned to paris to throw light on their researches
javert had in fact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean
chan phil let secretary of the prefecture under comte angles
m
sign
attached to the police force of paris
there is very rendered himself useful in divers and though the word may seem strange for such services honorable man news
he no longer thought of jean valjean the wolf of today causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday when in december here as a newspaper he who never read newspapers but i avert a monarchical man had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo into bayonne
just as he was finishing the article which interested him a name the name of jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page
the paper announced that the conduct jean valjean was dead and publishes the fact in such formal terms that is very did not doubt it
then he threw aside the paper and thought no more about it
some time afterwards it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of these ones house to the prefecture of police in paris concerning the abduction of a child which had taken place under peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of mont vermeil
a little girl of seven or eight years of age the report said who had been in trusted by her mother to an innkeeper of that neighborhood had been stolen by a stranger this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named fantine who had died in the hospital it was not known where or when
the name of fantine was well known to him
he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the flash forming vermeil
some signs has made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for he had not been seen in the village itself
what had he been intending to do in that region of mont vermeil
it could not even be surmised
javert understood it now
jean valjean was going there in search other
and now this child had been stolen by a stranger
who could that stranger be
could it be jean valjean
but jean valjean was dead
javert without saying anything to anybody took the coach from the pester platter culdesac de la planchette and made a trip to mont vermeil
he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found a great deal of obscurity
for the first few days the the barriers had shattered in their rage
the disappearance of the park has created a sensation in the village
he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story which ended in the abduction of a child
hence the police report
but their first vexation having passed off the barrier with his wonderful instinct had very quickly compra genres that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering eye of justice
the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to them
and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received
he understood nothing about it no doubt he had grumbled for a while at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness but her grandfather had come for her in the most natural day in the world
he added the grandfather which produced a good effect
this was the story that is very hit upon when heart j vacation test memo
the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish
who was that grandfather
and what was his name
thenardier replied with simplicity he is a wealthy farmer
i saw his passport
i think his name wash
guillaume lambert
lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name
thereupon javert returned to paris
jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am an in ny
he had again begun to forget this history when in the course of march be heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of saint medard and who had been surnames the mendicant who gives alms
this person the story ran was a man of means whose name no one knew exactly and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years who knew nothing about herself save that she had come from mont vermeil
mont vermeil
that name was always coming up and it made javert prick up his ears
an old beggar police spy and cheadle to whom this person had given aims added a few more details
this gentleman of property was very any never coming out except in the evening speaking to no one except occasionally to the poor and never allowing anyone to approach him
he wore a horrible old yellow frock coat which was worth many millions being a low added with bank bills
the suspected individual did indeed approach is very this disguised and bestowal me on him
at that moment javert raised his head and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received by kavery when he thought he recognized jean valjean
he followed his many other or beau house and got the old woman to talking which was no difficult matter
the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the cost lined with millions and narrated to him the episode of the thousand franc bill
she had seen it
she had handled it
javert hired a room that evening be installed himself in it
on the following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the fall of the five franc piece was noticed by the old woman who hearing the rattling of coin suspected that he might be intending to leave and made haste to warn javert
at night when jean valjean came out javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men
javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize that was his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next because to lay hands on an ex convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead in a criminal whom justice had formerly classes forever as among male factors of the most dangerous sort was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to a newcomer like javert and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict and lastly because javert being an artist had a taste for the unforeseen
he hated those well heralded successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off
he preferred to elaborate his masterpieces in the dark and to unveil then suddenly at the last
why had not javert arrested jean valjean
because he was still in doubt
it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease the free press embarrassed it several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers had echoed even as far as the chambers and had rendered the prefecture timid
interference with individual liberty was a grave matter
the police agents were afraid of making a mistake the prefect laid the blame on them a mistake meant dismissal
the reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph reproduced by twenty newspapers would have caused in paris yesterday an aged grandfather with white hair a respectable and well to do gentleman who was walking with his grand child aged eight was arrested and conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escaped convict
let us repeat in addition that is very had scruples of his own injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect
he was really in doubt
jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark
for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not a good honest old fellow living on his income he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds some chief of a dangerous band who have aims to conceal his other talents which was an old dodge
all these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man
to arrest him too hastily would be to kill the men that laid the golden eggs
where was the inconvenience in waiting
havent was very sure that he would not escape
thus he proceeded on a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatical personage
it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a dram shop be decidedly recognized jean valjean
there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recovers her child and the tigers more covers his prey
javert have that profound start
as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean the formidable conv of the perceived that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise
one puts on gloves before grasping at horn cudgel
this delay and the halt at the carrefour roll into consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail
he speedily divined however that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself
he bent his head and reflected like a bloodhound who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the rights cent
javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to the bridge of austerlitz
a word with the toll keeper furnished him with the information which he required have you seen a man with a little girl
i made him pay two sous replied the toll keeper
javert reached the bridge on season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by the hand
he saw him enter the rue du chem invert saint antoine he remembered the culdesac gene of arranged there like a trap and of the sole exit of the rue de kit mug into the rue petit pic pic
he made sure of his back burrows as huntsmen say he hastily despatched one of his agents by a roundabout way to guard that issue
a patrol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made a requisition only and caused it to accompany him
in such games soldiers are aces
moreover the principle is that in order to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the science off emery and plenty of dogs
these combinations having been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley gentot on the right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff
then he began the game
he experienced one ecstatic and internal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter and of the cat which lets the mouse run
claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers
what a delight this strangling is
is very was enjoying himself
the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted
he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand
accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible however vigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be
k l lustration javert on the hunt nj avert on the hunt javert advanced slowly sounding searching on his way all the books of the street like so many pockets of thieves
when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there
his exasperation can be imagined
he interrogated his sentinel of the eyes droit mud and petit pico us that agent who had remained in perturba boys this post has not seen the man pass
it sometimes happens that a drag is lost head and horns that is to say he escapes although he has the packing is very heels and then the oldest huntsmen know not what today
duvivier livni ville and desire shalt short
in a discomfiture of this sort art on he exclaims it was not a stab but a sorcerer
javert would have liked to utter the same cry
his disappointment bordered for a moment in despair and rage
it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia and that is best blundered in this campaign against jean valjean
he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the ex convict
the first glance should have sufficed him
he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong on not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise
he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin
advice is certainly useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence but the hunter can not be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict
javert by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart and so made him run
above all he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread
he thought himself stronger than he was and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion
at the same time he reckoned himself as too weak when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement
fatal precaution waste of precious time
javert committed all these blunders and nonetheless was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that even existed
he was in the full force of the term what is called in de nerja knowing dog
but what is there that is perfect
great strategists have their eclipses
the greatest follies are often composed like the largest roles of a multitude of strands
take the cable tv read by thread take all the petty determining motives separately and you can break them one after the other and you say that is all there is of it
braid them twist them together the result is enormous it is angola hesitating between marcia not the east and valentinian on the west it is hannibal tarrying at capua it is canton falling asleep at arc issue aube
however that maybe even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him javert did not lose his head
sure that the convict who had broken his van could not be far off be established sentinel she organized traps and ambuscade sand beat the quarter all that night
the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose role has been cut
apr sculls sign which however led him a stray since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the culdesac gentot
in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens who we found sad joined the immense stretches of wasteland
jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction
the fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the culdesac gentot he would probably have done so and have been lost
javert explored these gardens and these waste stretches as though he had been hunting for a needle
at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook and returned to the prefecture of police as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a rubber might have been
book sixth
le petit ii cpus chapter i number rue petit pico is nothing half a century ago more resembled every other carriage rate than the carriage rate of number rue petit pic pic
this entrance which usually stood a jar in the most inviting fashion permitted a view of two things neither of which have anything very funereal about them a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines and the face of a lounging porter
above the wall at the bottom of the court tall trees were visible
when a day of sunlight enlivened the courtyard when a glass of wine cheered up the porter it was difficult to pass number little pic pic street without carrying away a smiling impression of it
nevertheless it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse
the threshold smiled the house prayed and wept
if one succeeded in passing the porter which was not easy which was even nearly impossible for everyone for there was an open sesame
staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows
the corridor took a turn and became dark
if one doubled this cape one arrived a few paces further on in front of a door which was all the more mysterious be vaude it was not fastened
a white full light fell from a large window with tiny pages on the left which usurped the whole width of the room
one based about but saw no one one listened one heard neither a footstep not a human murmur
the walls were bare the chamber was not furnished there was not even a chair
one looked again and be held on the wall facing the doors quadrangular hole about a foot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars black knotted solid which formed squares i had almost said meshes of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length
the little green flowers of the bank in paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact
supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin actors day when hrs hc for an exit through the square hole this grating would have prevented it
it did not allow the passage of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to say of the mind
this seems to have occurred to them for it had been re enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer
at the bottom of this plate an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letterbox
a bit of tape attached to a bellaire hung at the right of the grated opening
if the tape was pulled a bell rang and one heard a voice very near at hand which made one start
who is there
the voice demanded
here again there was a magical word which it was necessary to know
if one did not know if the voice ceases the wall became silent once more as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it
if one knew the password the voice resume center on the right
one then perceived on the right facing the windows glass door surmounted by a frame flawed and painted gray
on raising the latch and crossing the threshold one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted
one was in factiva sort of theatre box narrow furnished with two old chairs and a much frayed straw matting sparely illuminated by the vague light from the glass doors regular box with its front just of a height to lean upon hearing a tablet of blackwood
this box was grated only the grating of it was not of good ed wood as at the opera it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists
there he encountered a barrier of black shutter are enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painters gingerbread yellow
these shutters were divided into long narrow slats and they masked the entire length of the grating
they were always closed
at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters and saying i am here
what do you wish with me
it was a beloved sometimes an scored voice
no one was visible
hardly the sound of a breath was audible
it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb
if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions the coat of one of the shutters opened opposite you the evoked spirit became an apparition
behind the grating beyond the shutter one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight ahead of which only the mouth and the chin were visible the rest was covered with a black veil
one caught a glimpse of a black gui mps and a form that was barely defined covered with a black shroud
that head spoke with you but did not look at you and never smiled at you
the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black
this light was symbolical
nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances
a profound vagueness envelopes that form clad in mourning
your eyes searched that vagueness and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition
at the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing
what you be held was night emptiness shadows a wintry most mingled with a vapor from the tomb a sort of terrible peace a silence from which you could gather nothing not even signs a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing not even phantoms
what you be held was the interior of a cloister
it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernardine s of the perpetual adoration
the box in which you stood was the parlor
the first voice which had addressed you was that of the port read who always sat motionless and silent on the other side of the wall near the square opening screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holds as by a double visor
the obscurity which bathed they rated box arose from the fact that the parlor which had a window on the side of the world had gone on the side of the convent
profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place
nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow there was a light there was life in the midst of that death
although this was the most strictly walled of all convents we shall endeavor to make our way into it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the proper bounds things which storytellers have never seen and have therefore never described
chapter ii the obedience of martin verga this convent which in had already existed for many along year in the eye petit pic pic was a community of bernard knew of the obedience of mary under ga
these bernard ones were attached in consequence not to clairvaux like the bernardine monks but to citeaux like the benedictine monks
in other words they were the subjects not of saint bernard but it saint benoit
anyone who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin verga founded in a congregation of bernardine s benedictines with salamanca for the head of the order and alcala as the branch establishment
this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic countries of europe
there is nothing unusual in the latin church in these grafts of one order on another
to mention only a single order of saint benoit which is here in question there are attached to this order without counting the obedience of martin very about congregations two in italy mont casein and sainte just one of padua two in france count and saint hair and nine orders vallombrosa grammont the celestine the canal rules the carthusians the hull lies the olivar sure the silvestri ns and lastly citeaux for citeaux itself a trunk for other orders is only an offshoot of saint benoit
citeaux dates from saint robert abbess miles me in the diocese of langres in
now it was in that the devil having retired to the desert of subiaco he was old had he turned hermit
was chased from the ancient temple of apollo where he dwelt by saint benoit then aged seventeen
after the role of the carmelites who go barefoot wear a bit of willow on their throats and never sit down the harshest rule is that of the bernardine s benedictines of martin verna
they are clothed in black with a gui mpe which in accordance with the express command of saint benoit mounts to the chin
adobe observe with large sleeves a large woollen vail the gui mpe which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast the band which descends over their grow to their eyes this is their dress
all is black except the band which is white
the novices wear the same habit but all in white
the professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side
the bernardine s benedictines of martin verga practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictines called ladies of the holy sacrament who at the beginning of this century had two houses in paris one at the temple the other in the rue neuve sainte genevieve
however the bernardin ds benedictines of the petit pic pic of whom we are speaking were a totally different order from the ladies of the holy sacrament cloistered in the rue neuve sainte genevieve and at the temple
there were numerous differences in their rule there were some in their costume
the bernardine s benedictines of the petit pic pic wore the black gui mps and the benedictines of the holy sacrament and of the rue neuve sainte genevieve wore a white one and had besides on their breasts a holy sacrament about three inches long in silver gilt or gilded copper
the nuns of the petit pic pic did not wear this holy sacrament
the perpetual adoration which was common to the house of the petit pic pic and to the house of the temple leaves those two orders perfectly distinct
their only resemblance lies in this practice of the ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardine doc martin verga just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy the life and death of jesus christ and the virgin between the two orders which were nevertheless widely separated and on occasion even hostile
the oratory of italy established at florence by philip de nero and the oratory of france established by pierre de be tulle
their story of france claimed the precedence since philip den er i was only a saint while her hole was a cardinal
let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verna
these six months are a modification the rule says all the year but this drug get chemise intolerable in the heat of summer produced fevers and nervous spasms
the use of it had to be restricted
even with this palliation when the nuns put on this chemise ont meth of september they suffer from fever for three or four days
obedience poverty chastity perseverance in their seclusion these are their vows which the rule greatly aggravates
the prioress i selected for three years by the mothers who are called me tesco sales because they have a voice in the chapter
a prioress can only be reflected twice which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years
they never see the officiating priest who is always hidden from them by a very w curtain nine feet in height
during the sermon when the preacher is in the chapel they drop their veils over their faces
they must always speak low walk with their eyes on the ground and their heads bowed
one man only is allowed to enter the convent the archbishop of the diocese
there is really on either the gardener
but he is always an old man and in order that he may always be alone in the garden and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him a bell is attached to his knee
their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive
it is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation
as at the voice of christ it cock christi at a gesture at the first sign ad but i had primum signum immediately with cheerfulness with perseverance with a certain blind obedience promote til writer per se ve range get card squad an obedient is as the file in the hand of the work hahaha soliman in man in us fabri without power to read or to write without express permission levers del scribers nomad disc edit wine express a superior is lucentis
each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation
the reparation is the prayer for all the sins for all the faults for all the dissensions for all the violations for all the iniquities for all the crimes committed on earth
when her fatigue becomes unendurable she prostrated herself flat on her face against the earth with her arms outstretched in the form of across this is her only relief
in this attitude she prays for all the guilty in the universe
this is great to sublimity
as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle it is called without distinction to make reparation or to beat the post
the nuns even prefer out of humility this last expression which contains an idea of torture and a basement
to make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed
the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her
besides this there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament
this station lasts an hour
they relieve each other like soldiers on guard
this is the perpetual adoration
the prior essex and the mothers almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ as mother nativity mother conception mother presentation mother passion
but the names of saints are not interdicted
when one sees them one never sees anything but their mouths
all their teeth are yellow
no toothbrush ever entered that consent
they never say my
they possess nothing of their own and they must not attach themselves to anything
they call everything our thu so he fell out chaplet if they were speaking of their chemise they would say our chemise
sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book of hours a relic a medal that has been blessed
as soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object they must give it up
they recall the words of saint therese to whom a great lady said as she was on the point of entering her order permit me mother to fend for a bible to which i am greatly attached
ah you are attached to something
in that case do not enter our order
every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up to have a place of her own a chamber
they live with their cells open
when they meet one says blessed and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
the other responds forever
hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard today hastily forever
like all practices this becomes mechanical by force of habit and one sometimes ways for ever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
among the visit an finds the one who enters says ave maria and the one whose cell is entered says gratis porn a
it is their way of saying good day which is in fact full of grace
at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the consent
and soon according to the hour
this custom the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to god exists in many communities the formula alone varies
thus at the infant jesus they say at this hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kind of my heart
the bernardine s benedictines of martin verga cloistered fifty years ago at let it pic pic chant the offices to a solemn psalmody a pure gregorian chant and always with full voice during the whole course of the office
everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause and say in a low voice jesus marie joseph
for the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth
the effect produced is striking and tragic
the nuns of the petit pic pic had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community
the government as they say does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the convent when they die
this is an affliction to them and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules
they had obtained a mediocre consolation at best permission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vaugirard cemetery which was made of land which has formerly belonged to their community
on fridays the nuns gear high mass vespers and all the office was on sunday
they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world of which the church of france was so prodigal in the olden days and of which it is still prodigal in spain and italy
their stations in the chapel are interminable
as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenious remark of one of them the prayers of the postulant care frightful the prayers of the novices are still worse and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse
once a week the chapter assembles the prior was presided the vocal mothers assist
each sister kneels in turn on the stones and confesses alone in the presence of all the faults and sins which she has committed during the week
the vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud
besides this confession in a lousy one for which all faults in the least serious are reserved they have for their denial offences what they call the couple
the couple of pesca vi is made for a very small matters broken glass storm veil an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office a false note in church etc
this suffices and the couple is made
the couple is entirely spontaneous it is the culpable person herself the word is etymologically in its place here who judges herself and inflict sit on herself
on festival days and sundays four mother present its into be the offices before a large reading desk with four places
one day one of the mother prevent or a intoned a psalm beginning with ecce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do so sol for this piece of absent mindedness she underwent a couple which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter had laughed
when a jun is summoned to the parlor even we felt the prioress herself she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is visible
the prioress alone can hold communication with at dangers
the others can see only their immediate family and that very rarely
if by chance an outsider presents herself to see a minor one whom she has known and lived in the outer world a regular series of negotiations is required
if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted then incomes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only for another or sister
it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to men
such is the rule of saint benoit aggravated by martin verna
these guns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other orders often are
they are pale and grave
between and three of them went mad
chapter iii austerities one is a postulant for two years at least often for four a novice for four
it is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age of twenty three or twenty four years
the bernardine s benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their order
in their cells they deliver themselves up to many unknown maserati one of which they must never speak
on the day when a novice makes her profession she is dressed in her handsome e fat tire she is crowned with white roses her hair is brushed until it shines and curled
then she prostrates herself a great black veil is thrown over her and the office for the dead is sung
then the nine separate into two files onefile passes close to her saying in plaintive accents our sister is dead and the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy our sister is alive on jesus christ
at the epoch when this story takes place a boarding school was attached to the convent a boarding school for young girls of noble and mostly wealthy families among whom could be remarked mademoiselle de saint aulaire and we nelissen and an english girl bearing the illustrious catholic name of talbot
these young girls reared by these guns between four walls grew up with a horror of the world and of the age
one of them said to us one day the sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot
they were dressed in blue with a white cap and a holy spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast
in the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments
this seemed profane and the prior rss forbade it
only the novices were permitted to lend
it is remarkable that these performances tolerated and encouraged to doubt in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars
they simply amused themselves with it
it was new it gave them a change
the pupils conformed with the exception of the austerities to all the practices of the convent
there was a certain young woman who entered the world and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever anyone knocked at her door forever
like the nuns the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor
their very mothers did not obtain permission to embrace them
the following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point was carried
one day a young girl received a visit from her mother who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age
the young girl wept for she wished greatly to embrace her sister
impossible
she begged that at least the child might be permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could miss it
this was almost indignantly refused
chapter iv gay et les nonetheless these young girls filled this grave house with charming souvenirs
at certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister
the recreation hours truck
a door swung on its hinges
the fires said good here come the children
an irruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with across like a shroud
radiant faces white foreheads innocent eyes full of merry light all sorts of auroras were scattered about amid these shadows
after the psal mowies the below the peaks and on file and offices the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise offers
the hive of joy was opened and each one brought her money
they played they called to each other they formed into groups they ran about pretty little white teeth chattered in the corners the veils superintended the laughs from a distance shades kept watch of the sunbeams but what mattered it
still they beamed and laughed
those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy
they looked on vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweets warming of the hives
it was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning
the young girls frolicked beneath the eyes of the nuns the gaze of in less ability does not embarrass innocence
thanks to these children there was among so many austere hours one hour of ingenuousness
the little ones skipped about the elder one dvanced
in this cloister play was mingled with heaven
nothing is so delightful and so august as all these fresh expanding young souls
homer would have come thither to laugh with o default and there was in that black garden youth health noise cries giddiness pleasure happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ance stresses those of the epic as well as those of the fairy tale those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from hecuba to lame deer and
it was between those four gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day mother
one of the big girls has just told me that i have only nine years and ten months longer to remain here
what happiness
it was here too that this memorable dialogue took place a vocal mother
why are you weeping my child
the child aged six
i told alia that i knew my french history
she says that i do not know it but i do
alix the big girl aged nine
noche does not know it
the mother
how is that my child
alix
she told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question in the book and she would answer it
well
she did not answer it
let us see about it
what did you ask her
i opened the book at random as she proposed and i put the first question that i came across
and what was the question
it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just like a person
it was on one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once picked up a confession which had been written out in advance in order that she might not forget it by a winner of seven years father i accuse myself of having been avaricious
father i accuse myself of having been an adulteress
father i accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen
it was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six years of age improvised the following tale which was listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years there were three little cocks who owned a country where there were a great many flowers
they plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets
after that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings
there was a wolf in that country there was a great deal of forest and the wolf was in the forest and usage the little cocks
and this other poem there came aglow with a stick
it was punchinello who best i see it on the cat
it was not good for her it hurt her
the galaxy put punchinello in prison
it was there that a little abandoned child abound long whom the convent was bringing up out of charity uttered this sweet and heartbreaking saying
she heard the others talking of their mothers and she murmured in her corner as for me my mother was not there when i was born
there was a stout old trees who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys and whose names assisted agatha
the big big girls those over ten years of age called her agathocles
the refectory a large apartment of an oblong square form which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden was dark and damp and as the children say full of beasts
all the place around about furnished their contingent of insects
each of its four corners had received in the language of the pupils a special and expressive name
there was spider corner caterpillar corner wood louse corner and cricket corner
cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed
it was not so cold there as elsewhere
from the refectory the names had passed to the boarding school and there served as in the old college mazarin to distinguish four nations
every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at heals
one day monseigneur the archbishop while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the classroom through which he was passing
he inquired of another pupils charming brunette with rosy cheeks who stood near him who is that
she is a spider monseigneur
bah
and that one yonder
she is a cricket
and that one
she is a caterpillar
really
and yourself
i am a wood louse monseigneur
every house of this sort has its own peculiarities
at the beginning of this century etoken was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august
are cohen in order to take rank in the procession of the holy sacrament a distinction was made between virgins and florists
there were also the dais and the sensors the first who held the corrs of the dais and the others who carried in sense before the holy sacrament
the flowers belonged by right to the florists
four virgins walked in advance
on the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory who is a virgin
madame campan used to quote this saying of a little one of seven years to a big girl of sixteen who took the head of the procession while she the little one remained at the rear you are a virgin but i am not
chapter v distractions above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white paternoster and which possessed the property of hearing people straight to paradise was inscribed in large black letters little white paternoster which god made which god said which god placed in paradise
in the evening when i went to bed i found three angels sitting on my be done at the foot two at the head the good virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation
the good god is my father the good virginia my mother the three apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters
madame the virgin was walking through the meadows weeping for god when she met m
saint john
in this characteristic prison had disappeared from the fall under a triple coating of daubing paint
at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and who are old women now
a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned opened in the garden
two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other if the refectory
the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents
the meals were plain and the food of the children themselves severe
a single dish of meat and vegetables combined or salt fish such was their luxury
this meagre care which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an exception
the children are in silence under the eye of the mother whose turn it was who i eat it took a motion to fly or to him against the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to home
this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix
the reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn
at regular distances on the bare tables there were large varnished bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forms and into which they sometimes threesome scrap of tough meat or spoiled rich this was punished
the child who broke the silence made across with her tongue
where
on the ground
she licked the pavement
the dust that end of all joys was charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose leaves which had been guilty of chirping
there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read
it is the rule of saint benoit
an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate
be more by mass eu constitution e snow trax extern is communica bit
the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume precipitately
from the great danger this incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure
the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys
they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby fruit trees
in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered when the wind had shaken the trees they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sky
i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty years ago by an old pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris
that was one of their greatest luxuries
the water was accepted but not one of those who get believed that she would do it
mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the prettiest little rosy face in the world
m
three days if you like
i grant you three days
the prioress could do nothing the archbishop had spoken
horror of the convent but joy of the pupil
the effect may be imagined
this stern cloister was not do well walled off however but that the life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance did not make their way in
to prove this we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and incontestable fact which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we are relating
about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine
nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead
beneath this history it was said the repay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage
this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes
could she see
there was some doubt about this
when lives rather than walker she never spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed
her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh
to touch her hand was like touching snow
she possessed a strange spectral grace
wherever she entered people felt sold
one day a sister on seeing her pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman
perhaps she is one replied the other
a hundred tales were told of madame albertine
this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils
it was in this gallery which had only a circular bayani wilde boeuf that madame albertine listened to the offices
she always occupied it alone because from this gallery being on the level of the first story the preacher of the officiating priest could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns
one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank m
le duc de rohan peer of france officer of the red musketeers in when he was prince de leon and who died afterward in as cardinal and archbishop of besancon
it was the first time that m
de rohan had preached at the petit pic pic convent
madame albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services
that day as soon as she caught sight of m
de rohan she half rose and said in a loud voice amid the silence of the chapel at
auguste
the whole community turned their heads in amazement the preached raised his eyes but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility
a breath from the outer world a flash of life had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished and the mad woman had become a corpse again
those two words however had set everyone in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering
how many things were contained in that an
auguste
what revelations
h
it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society since she knew m
de rohan and that her own rank there was of the highest since she spoke thus familiarly of soft data lord and that there existed between them some connection of relationship perhaps but a very close one in any case since she knew his pet name
two very severe duchesses mesdames de choiseul and decedent often visited the community whither they penetrated no doubt in virtue of the privilege magnates julie red and caused great consternation in the boarding school
when these two old ladies passed by all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes
moreover m
de rohan quite unknown to himself was an object of attention to the school girls
at that epoch he had just been made while waiting for the episcopate vicar general of the archbishop of paris
it was one of his habits to come tolerably often to celeb fatf the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the petit pic pic
not one of the young recluses could see him because of these red curtain but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice which they had come to know and to distinguish
he had been a no issue faire and then he was said to be very coquettish that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moore and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world
he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years
not a sound from without made its way into the convent
but there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither
this was an event and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall of
it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood
the young girls passed hours in listening to it the vocal mothers were upset by it brains were busy punishments descended in showers
this lasted for several months
the girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician
each one dreamed that she was set kobe
the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue de kit mug and they would have given anything compromised everything attempted anything for the sake of seeing of catching a glance if only for a second of the young man who played that flute so deliciously and who no doubt played on all these souls at the same time
there were some who made their escape by a backdoor and ascended to the third story on the rue de kit mug side in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps
impossible
one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating and to save her white handkerchief
two were still holder
they found means to climb on a roof and risked their lives there and succeeded at last in seeing the young man
he was an old emigre gentleman blind and penniless who was playing his flute in his attic in order to pass the time
chapter vi the little convent in this enclosure of the petit pic pic there were three perfectly distinct buildings the great convent inhabited by the nuns the boarding school where the scholars were lodged and lastly what was called the little content
it was a building with a garden in which lived all sorts of aged nine of various orders the relics of cloisters destroyed in the revolution art union of all the black gray and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties what might be called if such a coupling of words is permissible a sort of harlequin convent
when the empire was established all these poor old dispersed and exiled women had been afforded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of the bernardine s benedictines
the government paid them a small pension the ladies of the petit pic pic received them cordially
it was a singular pell help
each followed her own rule sometimes the pupils of the boarding school were allowed as a great recreation to pay them a visit the result is that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of mother sainte bazile mother saint esc plastique and mother jacob
one of these refugees found herself almost at home
she was a nun of sainte surf the only one of her order who had survived
the ancient convent of the ladies of sainte sure occupied at the beginning of the eighteenth century this very house of the petit pic pic which belonged later to the benedictines of martin f edge
this holy woman too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order which was a white robe with a scarlet scapular y had piously put it on a little manikin which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house at her death
in only one jun of this order remained today there remains only a doll
in addition to these worthy mothers some old society women had obtained permission of the prioress like madame albertine to retire into the little convent
another was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose
the pupils called her madame vac we noni hubbub
uproar in the hive the vocal mothers were all in a flutter madame de mehlis had made romances
but she declared that she was the first to detect them and then she had reached her fierce stage of devotion
with the aid of god and of the prince she entered
she departed at the end of six or eight months alleging as a reason that there was no shade in the garden
the nuns were delighted
although very old she still played the harp and did it very well
when she went away she left her mark in her cell
madame de gen pic was superstitious and a latin ist
these two words furnish a tolerably good profile offer
a few years ago there were still to be seen pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her jewels these five lines in latin written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper and which in her opinion possessed the property of frightening away robbers in paribus merit is pendent tria corpora ram ice is made the smashed i west covina potestas alta petite is macintel using images has noastre snow trax conserver summa potestas
how versus dmca and their titus per was
these verses in sixth century latin raise the question whether the two thieves of calvary were named as is commonly believed did mac and test as of dismas and team as
this orthography might have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century by the vicomte de testes of a descent from the wicker thief
however the useful for the attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the hospitallers
the church of the house constructed in such a manner as to separate the great convent from the boarding school like a veritable intrenchments as of course common to the boarding school the great convent and the little content
the public was even admitted by a sort of lazare tho entrance on the street
but all was so arranged that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world
suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand and folded in such a manner as to form not as in ordinary churches a prolongation behind the altar but a sort of hall or obscure cellar to the right of the officiating priest suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height of which we have already spoken in the shadow of that curtain pole upon wooden stalls the nuns in the choir on the left the school girls on the right the lay sisters and the novices at the bottom and you will have some idea of the nuns of the petit po cpus assisting at divine service
that cavern which was called the choir communicated with the cloister by a lobby
the church was lighted from the garden
when the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoined silence the public was warned of their presence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling
chapter vii some silhouettes of this darkness during the six years which separate from the prioress of the per it pic puedas mademoiselle de bien sur whose name in religion was mother innocents
she came of the family of marguerite de bien sur author of lives of the saints of the order of saint benoit
she had been reelected
she was a woman about sixty years of age short thick singing like a cracked pot says the letter which we have already quoted an excellent woman moreover and the only merry one in the whole com vent and for that reason adored
she was learned erudite else competent curiously proficient in history crammed with latin stuffed with greek full of hebrew and more of a benedictine monk than a benedictine jun
the sub prioress was an old spanish jun mother cinerea who was almost blind
there was also among the prettiest of them a charming girl of three and twenty who was from the isle de bourbon a descendant of the chevalier rose whose name had been mademoiselle rose and who was called mother assumption
mother sainte mechtild e intrusted with the singing and the choir was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter
she usually took a complete scale of them that is to say seven from ten to sixteen years of age inclusive of assorted voices and sizes whom she made sing standing drawn up in a line side by side accord lift page from the smallest to the largest
this pre sented to the eye something in the nature of a reed pile of young girls a sort of living panpipe made of angels
those of the lay sisters whom the scholars loved most were sisters up gracie sister sainte marguerite sister saint smart he who was in need of age and sister sainte michel whose long nose made them laugh
all these women were gentle with the child tsn
the nuns were severe only towards themselves
no fire was lighted except in the school and the food was choice compared to that in the convent
moreover they lavished a thousand cards on their scholars
only when a child passed near a nun and addressed her thehun never replied
this rule of silence had had this effect that throughout the whole convent speech had been withdrawn from human creatures and bestowed on inanimate objects
a very sonorous bell placed beside the port fees and which was audible throughout the house indicated by its varied peaks which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph all the actions of material life which were to be performed and summoned to the parlor in case of need such of such an inhabitant of the house
each person and each thing had its own peak
the prioress had one and one the sub prioress one and two
six five announced lessons so that the pupils never said to go to lessons but to go to six five
it was very often heard
termine strokes announced a great event
it was the opening of the door of seclusion a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its hinges on the presence of the archbishop
with the exception of the archbishop and the gardener no man entered the convent as we have already said
the school girls saw two other done the chaplain the abbe babes old and ugly whom they were permitted to contemplate in the choir through a grating the other the drawing master m
ansi aux whom the letter of which we have perused a few lines calls m
an slot and describes as a frightful old hunchback
it will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen
such was this curious house
chapter viii postcode a lapides after having sketched its moral face it will not prove unprofitable to point out in a few words its material configuration
the reader already has some idea of it
the convent of the petit pic our sainte antoine filled almost the whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the tiepolo mc eau the riesgo it hurt her he petit pic pic and the unused land called the aymara is on old plans
these four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat
the convent was composed of several buildings and a garden
the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the rue de kit mug comprised between the rue of tit pic pic and the eu cool once xu the lesser arm was a lofty gray severe grated facade which faced the rue petit picpic the carriage entrance no
marked its extremity
towards the centre of this facade was all watched door whitened with dust and ashes where the spiders wide their webs and which was open only for an hour or two on sundays and on rare occasions when the coffin of an un left the convent
this was the public entrance of the church
in the main arm were the cells of the mothers the sisters and the novices
in the lease farm lay the kitchens the refectory backed up by the cloisters and the church
between the door no
and the corner of the closed landau marais was the school which was not visible from without
the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden which was much lower than the level of the rue po ponceau which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside
the garden which was slightly arched had in its centre in the summit of a hillock a fine pointed and conical fir tree whence ran as from the peaked boss of a shield four grand alleys and ranged by twos in between the branchings of these eight small ones so that if the enclosure had been circular the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel
as the alleys appended in the very irregular walls of the garden they were of unequal length
they were bordered with currant bushes
at the bottom an alley of talk poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent which was at the angle of the fuser kit mug to the house of the little convent which was at the angle of the aymara island
in front of the little convent was what was called the little garden
to this whole let the reader add a courtyard all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings prison walls the long black line of goods which bordered the other side of the rue po ponceau for its sole perspective and neighborhood and he will be able to form for himself a complete image or what the house of the bernardine for the petit pic pic was forty years ago
this holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century which was called the tennis ground of the eleven thousand devils
all these streets moreover were more ancient than paris
these names droit miranda im a raid are very ancient the streets which bear them are very much more ancient still
aymara island was call ext aug outlane the rue de kit mug was called the rue des egl antlers for god opened flowers before man cut stones
chapter is a century under a gui mpe since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the petit pic pic was informed times and since we have ventured to open a window on that discreet retreat the reader will permit is one other little digression utterly foreign to this book but characteristic and useful since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures
in the little convent there was a centenarian who came from the abbey of fonts brault
she had even been in society before the revolution
she talked a great deal of k
demi rome ship keeper of fur seals under louis xvi
and of a president essen play with whom she had been very intimate
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
she told wonders of the abbey of fonts brault that it was like a city and that there were streets in the monastery
she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to home turn eur saint procopius etc
etc
and thus i give it to you father
and the school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers brown
on another occasion the centenarian was telling stories
she said that in her youth the bernardine monks were every who has good as the mousa yet aires
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
she told about the custom of the four winds which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne
when a great personages marshal of france a prince a duke and a peer traversed a town in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine
on the first goblet this inscription could be read monkey wine on the second lion wine on the third sheep wine on the fourth hotel ne
these four legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard the first intoxication which enlivens the second that which irritates the third that which fills and the fourth that which brutalizes
in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal
the rule of fonts brault did not forbid this
she would not show this object to anyone
she shut herself up which her rule allowed her to do and his herself every time that she desired to contemplate it
if she heard a footstep in the corridor she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands
as soon as it was mentioned to her she became silent she who was so fond of talking
the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy
thus it furnishes a subject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent
what could that treasure of the centenarian be which was so precious and so secret
some holy book no doubt
some unique chaplet
some authentic delic
they lost themselves in conjectures
when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth like some consecrated paten
it was a faenza platter representing little loves flitting away pursued by apothecary laws armed with enormous syringes
the chase abounds in grimaces and in comical pictures
one of the charming little lives is already fairly a pitted
he is resisting fluttering his fi my wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanic a pair
moral love conquered by the colic
this platter which is very curious and which has possibly the honor of furnishing moliere with an idea was still in existence in september it was for sale by african rac merchant in the boulevard beaumarchais
this good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because said she the parlor is too gloomy
chapters origin of the perpetual adoration however this almost sepulchral parlor of which we have sought to convey an idea is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents
at the convent of the rue du temple in particular which belonged in truth to another order the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor whose windows were draped in white muslim curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames a portrait of a benedictine jun with unveiled face painted bouquets and even the head of a turk
it is in that garden of the temple convent that stood that famous chestnut tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in france and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm
as we have said this convent of the temple was occupied by benedictines of the perpetual adoration benedictines quite different from those who depended on citeaux
this order of the perpetual adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years
in the holy sacrament was profaned on two occasions a few days apart in two churches in paris at saint sulpice and at saint jean en breve a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar
m
but this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women madame court in marquise de house and the comtesse de chateau vieux
this outrage committee on the most holy sacrament of the altar though but temporary would not depart from these holy souls and it seemed to them that it could only be eaten hated by a perpetual adoration in some female monastery
both of them one in the other in made donations of notable sums to mother catherine de var called of the holy sacrament a benedictine jun for the purpose of founding to this pooh send a monastery of the order of saint benoit the first permission for this foundation was given to mother catherine de barnum
demetz abbe of saint germain on condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income which amounts to six thousand livres to the principal
after the abbe of saint germain the king accorded letters patent and all the rest abbatial charter and royal letters was confirmed in by the chamber of accounts and the parliament
such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the benedictines of the perpetual adoration of the holy sacrament at paris
their first convent was a new building in the rue cassette out of the contributions of mesdames de vous sandra chateau vieux
this order as it will be seen was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of citeaux
it mounted back to the abbe of saint germain des pres in the same manner that the ladies of the sacred heart go back to the general of the jesuits and the sisters of charity to the general of the lazarus ts
it was also totally different from the bernardine s of the petit pic pussy pee interior we have just shown
in pope alexander vii
had authorized by a special brief the bernardine s of the rue petit pico us to practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictine nuns of the holy sacrament
but the two orders remained distinct nonetheless
chapter xi end of the petit pico us at the beginning of the restoration the convent of the petit pic pic was in its decay this forms a part of the general death of the order which after the eighteenth century has been disappearing like all the religious orders
the house of the petit pic pic was becoming rapidly depopulated
in the little convent had bus appeared the school had disappeared
there were no longer any old women hot young girls the first were read the latter had taken their departure
vol a very nt
the rule of the perpetual adoration is so rigid in its nature that it alarms vocations recoil before it the order receives no recruits
in it still obtained lay sisters here and there
but of processed bunch one at all
forty years ago the nuns numbered nearly a hundred fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty eight of them
how many are there today
in the prioress was young a sign that the circle of choice was restricted
she was not forty years old
in proportion as the number diminishes the fatigue increases the service of each becomes more painful the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to near the heavy rule of saint benoit
the burden is implacable and remains the same for there was for the many
it weighs down it crushes
thus they die
at the period when the author of this book still lived in paris two died
one was twenty five years old the other twenty three
this latter can say like julia all inula his jacek
via iannis big in fiery red
it is in consequence of this decay that the convent gave up the education of girls
we have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without entering it and without introducing the minds which accompany us and which are listening to our tale to the profit of some perchance of the melancholy history of jean valjean
we have penetrated into this community full of those old practices which seem so novel today
it is the closed garden hortus cinclus us
we have spoken of this singular place in detail but with respect insofar at least as detail and respect are compatible
we do not understand all but we insult nothing
we are equally far removed from the hosanna of joseph de maistre who wound up by anointing the executioner and from the sheer of voltaire who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross
the assassinated sage
in this nineteenth century the religious idea is undergoing aerials
people are in learning certain things and they do well provided that while in learning them they learnt his there is no vacuum in the human heart
certain demolitions take place and it is well that they do not on condition that they are followed by reconstructions
in the meantime let us study things which are no more
it is necessary to know them if only for the purpose of avoiding them
the counterfeits of the past assume false names and gladly call themselves the future
this spectre this past is given to falsifying its own passport
let us inform ourselves of the trap
let us be on our guard
the past has a visage superstition and a mask hypocrisy
let us denounce the visage and let us tear off the mask
as for convents they present a complex problems question of civilization which condemns them a question of liberty which protects them
book seventh
parenthesis chapter i the content as an abstract idea this book is a drama whose leading personage is the infinite
man is the second
such being the case and a convent having happened to be on our road it has been our duty to enter it
why
because the convent which is common to the orient as well as to the occident to antiquity as well as to modern times to paganism to buddhism to mahometan usm as well as to christianity is one of the optical apparatuses applied by man to the infinite
this is not the place for enlarging w is proportionately in certain ideas nevertheless while absolutely maintaining our reserves our restrictions and even our indignation see must say that everytime we encounter man in the infinite either wall or ill understood we feel ourselves overpowered with respect
there is in the synagogue in the mosque in the pagoda in the wigwam a hideous side which we exec rate and a sublime side which we adore
what a contemplation for the mind and what endless food for thought is the reverberation of god upon the human wall
chapter ii the convent as an historical fact from the point of view of history of reason and of truth monasticism is condemned
monasteries when they abound in a nation are clogs in its circulation cumbrous establishments centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist
monastic communities are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak what the wart is to the human body
their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country
the monastic regime good at the beginning of civilization useful in the reduction of the brutal by the spiritual is bad when peoples have reached their manhood
moreover when it becomes relaxed and when it enters into its period of disorder it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity because it still continues to set the example
claus tration has had its day
cloisters useful in the early education of modern civilization have embarrassed its growth and are injurious to its development
so far as institution and formation with relation to manage concerned monasteries which were good in the tenth century questionable in the fifteenth are detectable in the nineteenth
the leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations italy and spain throne the light the other the splendor of europe for centuries and at the present day these two illustrious peoples are but just beginning to convalesce thanks to the healthy and vigorous hygiene of a line
the convent the ancient female convent in particular such as it still presents itself on the threshold of this century in italy in austria in spain is one of the most sombre concretions of the middle ages
the cloister that cloister is the point of intersection of horrors
the catholic cloister properly speaking is wholly filled with the black radiance of death
the spanish convent is the most funereal of all
there rise in obscurity beneath vaults filled with gloom beneath comes vague with shadow massive altars of babel as high as cathedrals there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark there are extended all nude on the ebony great christs of ivory more than bleeding bloody hideous and magnificent with their elbows displaying the bonds their kneeland showing their integument s their wounds showing their flesh crowned with silverthorne nailed with nails of gold with blood drops of rubies on their brows and diamond tears in their eyes
the diamonds and rubies seem web and make veiled beings in the shadow below deep their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their iron tipped scourges their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles their knees excoriated with prayer women who think themselves wives spectres who think themselves seraphim
do these women think
no
have the yang will
no
do they love
no
do they live
no
their nerves have turned to hone their bones have turned to stone
their veil is of woven night
their breath under their veil resembles the indescribably tragic respiration of death
the abbess a spectre sanctifies them and terrified them
the immaculate one is there and very fierce
such are the ancient monasteries of spain
pairs of terrible devotion caverns of virgins ferocious places
catholic spainish or from an than rome herself
the spanish convent was above all others the catholic convent
there was a flavor of the orient about it
the archbishop the kia lada ga of heaven locked up and kept watch over this seraglio of souls reserved for god
the gun was the odalisque the priest was the eunuch
the fervent were chosen in dreams and possessed christ
at night the beautiful nude young man descended from the cross and became the ecstasy of the cloistered one
lofty walls guarded the mystic sultana who had the crucified for her sultan from all living distraction
a glance on the outer world was infidelity
the in pace replaced the leather sack
that which was cast into the sea in the east was thrown into the ground in the west
in both quarters women wring their hands the waves for the first the grave for the last here there owned there the buried
monstrous parallel
today the upholders of the past unable to deny these things have adopted the expedient of smiling at them
there has come into fashion a strange and easy manner of suppressing the revelations of history of invalidating the commentaries of philosophy of sliding all embarrassing facts and all gloomy questions
a matter for declamation c say the clever
declamations repeat the foolish
jean jacques are claimed side to have claimed voltaire on calas la barre and sirven reclaimers
i know not who has recently discovered that tacitus was a de claimed that nero was a victim and that pity is decidedly due to that poor holofernes
facts however are awkward things to disconcert and they are obstinate
the author of this book has seen with his own eyes eight leagues distant from brussels there are relics of the middle ages there which are attainable for everybody at the abbey of villers the role of the oubliette win the middle of the field which was formerly the courtyard of the cloister and on the banks of the thu of our stone dungeons half underground half under the water
they were in pace
each of these dungeons has the remains of an iron doors vault and a grated opening which on the outside is two feet above the level of the river and on the inside six feet above the level of the ground
four feet of river flow last along the outside wall
the ground is always soaked
the occupant of turin pace had this wet soil for his bed
in one of these dungeons there is a fragment of an iron necklet riveted to the wall in another there can be seen a square box made of four slabs of granite too short for a person to lie down in too low for him to stand upright in
a human beings we put inside with a cover lid of stone on top
this exists
it can be seen
it can be touched
chapter iii on what conditions one can respect the past monasticism such as it existed in spain and such as it still exists in thibet is a sort of phthisis for civilization
it stops life story
it simply depopulated
claus tration castration
it has been the scourge of europe
add to this the violence so often done to the conscience the forced vocations feudalism bolstered up by the cloister the right of the firstborn pouring the excess of the family into monasticism thereto cities of which we have just spoken the un pave the closed mouths the walled up brains so many unfortunate minds placed in the dungeon of eternal vows the taking of the habit the interment of living souls
add individual tortured to national degradations and whoever you maybe you will shudder before the brick and the veil those two wind ing sheets of human deciding
nevertheless at certain points and in certain places in spite of philosophy in spite of progress the spirit of the cloister persists in the midst of the nineteenth century and a singular ascetic recrudescence is at this moment astonishing the civilized world
ing rates
says the garment i protested you in inclement weather
why will you have nothing to do with me
i have just come from the deep sea says the fish
i have been a rose says the perfume
i have loved you says the corpse
i have civilized you says the convent
to this there is but one tell him former days
to dream of the indefinite prolongation of defunct things and if the government of men by embalming to restore dogmas in abaddon dition to re gold shrines to patch up cloister store bless reliquaries to refurbish superstition store victual fanaticism stop yt new handles on holy water brushes and militarism to reconstitute monasticism and militarism to believe in the salvation of society by the multiplication of parasites to force the last on the present this seems strange
still there are theorists who hold such theories
these theorists who are in other respects people of intelligence have a very simple process they apply to the pasta glazing which they call social order divine right morality family the respect of elders antique authority sacred tradition legitimacy religion and they go about shouting look
take this honest people
this logic was known to the ancients
the soothsayers practise it
then rubbed a black heifer over with chalk and said she is white box cr status
as for us we respect the past here and there and we spare it above all provided that it consents to be dead
if it insists on being alive we attack it and we try to kill it
superstitions big o tries affected devotion prejudices those forms all forms as they are are tenacious of life they have teeth and nails in their smoke and they must be clasped close body to body answer must be made on them and that without truce for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms
it is difficult to seize darkness by the throat and to hurl it to the earth
a convent in france in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century is a college of owls saving the light
in ordinary times in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish one has only to make it spell out the date
but we are not in ordinary times
let us fight
let us fight but let us make a distinction
the peculiar property of truth is never to commit excesses
what need has it of exaggeration
there is that which it is necessary to destroy and there is that which it is simply necessary to elucidate and examine
what a force is kindly and serious examination
let us not apply a flame where only slight is required
so given the nineteenth century we are opposed as a general proposition and among all peoples in asia as well as in europe in india as well as in turkey to ascetic claus tration
whoever says cloister says harsh
their pure essence is evident their stagnation is unhealthy their fermentation infects people with fever and etiolated them their multiplication becomes a plague of egypt
we can not think without affright of those lands where fakirs gonze as anyone greek monks mar about et al spoons and dervishes multiply even like swarms of vermin
this said the religious question remains
this question has certain mysterious almost formidable sides may we be permitted to look at it fixedly
chapter iv the convent from the point of view of principles menu note themselves and dwell in communities
by virtue of what right
by virtue of the right of association
they shut themselves up at home
by virtue of what right
by virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door
they do not come forth
by virtue of what right
by virtue of the right to go and come which implies the right to remain at home
there at home what do they do
they altai in low tones they drop their eyes they tool
they renounce the world town seen qualities pleasures vanities price interests
they are clothed in coarse woollen or coarse linen
not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever
on entering there each one who was rich makes himself poor
what he has he gives to all
he who was what is called noble a gentleman and a lot did the equal of him who was a peasant
the cell is identical for all
all undergo the same tonsure wear the same fricke at the same black bread sleep on the same straddle on the same ashes
the same sack on their backs the same rope around their loins
if the decision has been to go barefoot a logo barefoot
there may be a prince among them that prince is the same shadow as the rest
no titles
even family names have disappeared
they bear only first names
all are bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names
they have dissolved the carnal family and constituted in their community a spiritual family
they have no other relatives than all men
they succor the poor they care for the sick
they elect those whom they obey
they call each other my brother
you stop me and exclaim but that is the ideal convent
it is sufficient that it may be the possible convent that i should take notice of it
thence it results that in the preceding book i have spoken of a convent with respectful accents
the middle ages cast aside asia cast aside the historical and political question held in reserve from the purely philosophical point of view outside the requirements of militant policy on condi to in that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties i shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive and in some respects a deferential gravity
wherever there is a community there is a commune where there is a commune there is tight
the monastery is the product of the formulas quality fraternity
oh
how grand of liberty
and what a splendid transfiguration
liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic
let us continue
but these men of these women who are behind these four walls
they dress themselves in coarse woollen they are equals they call each other brothers that is well but they do something else
yes
what
they gaze on the darkness they kneel and they clasp their hands
what does this signify
chapter v prayer they pray
town pm
to god
to pray to god what is the meaning of these words
is there an infinite beyond us
is that infinite there inherent permanent necessarily substantial since it is infinite and because if it lacked matter it would be bounded necessarily intelligent since it is infinite and because if it lacked intelligence it would end there
does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence
in other terms us if not the absolute of which we are only the relative
at the same time that there is an infinite without us is there not an infinite within us
are not these two infinite set at an alarming plural
superposed the one upon the other
is not this second infinite so to speak subjacent to the first
if this second infinity intelligent also
does it think
does it love
does it will
if these two infinities are intelligent each of them has a will principle and there is ani in the upper infinity as there is an inn the lower infinity
the inflow is the soul the ion high is god
to place the infinity here below in contact by the medium of thought with the infinity on high is called praying
let us take nothing from the human mind to suppress is bad
we must reform and transform
certain faculties in manage directed towards the unknown thought r every prayer
the unknown is an ocean
what is conscience
it is the compass of the unknown
though he every prayer these are great and mysterious radiation x
let us respect them
whither to these majestic irradiations of the soul
into the shadow that is to say to the light
the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity
close to the right of the man beside it at the least there exists the right of the soul
to crush fanaticism and to generate the infinite such is the law
let us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of creation and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars
we have a duty to labor over the human soul to defend the mystery against the miracle to adore the in comprehensible and reject the absurd to admit as an inexplicable fact only what is necessary to purify belief to remove superstitions from above religion to clear god of caterpillars
dual trevi the absolute goodness of prayer with regard to the modes of prayer all are good provided that they are sincere
turn your book upside down and be in the infinite
there is as we know a philosophy which denies the infinite
there is also a philosophy pathologically classified which denies the sun this philosophy is called blindness
the curious thing is the haughty superior and compassionate airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which he holds god
one fancied he hear sample crying i pity them with their sun
there are as we know powerful and illustrious atheists
at bottom led back to the truth by their very force they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists it is with them only a question of definition and in any case if they do not believe in god being great minds they prove god
we salute them as philosophers while inexorably denouncing their philosophy
let us go on
the remarkable thing about it is also their facility in paying themselves off with words
a metaphysical school of the north impregnated to some extent with dog has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word force with the word will
to say the plant wills instead of the plant grows this would be fecund in results indeed if we were to add the universe wills
why
because it would come to this the plant wills therefore it has ani the universe wills therefore it has a god
as for us who however in contra distinction to this school reject nothing apriori a will in the plant accepted by this school appears to us more difficult to admit ghana will in the universe denied by it
to deny the will of the infinite that is to say god is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite
we have demonstrated this
the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism
everything becomes a mental conception
with nihilism no discuss job is possible for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor and is not quite sure that it exists itself
from its point of view it is possible that it may be for itself only a mental conception
only it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump simply by the utterance of the word mind
in short no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all end in the monosyllable no
to go there is only one reply yes
nihilism has no point
there is no such thing as nothingness
aero does not exist
everything is something
nothing is nothing
man lives by affirmation even more than by bread
even to see and to show does not suffice
philosophy should be an energy it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man
socrates should enter into adam and produce marcus aurelius in other words the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the major felicity
eden should be changed into a lyceum
science should be a cordial
to enjoy what a sad aim and what a paltry ambition
the brut seniors
to offer thought to the thirst of men to give them all as an elixir the notion of god to make conscience and science fraternize in them to render them just by this mysterious confrontation such is the function of real philosophy
morality is a blossoming out of truths
contemplation leads to action
the absolute should be practicable
it is necessary that the ideal should be breathable drinkable and eat able to the human mind
it is the ideal which has the right to say take this
it is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion
philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at its ease without any other result than that of being convenient to curiosity
for our part adjourning the development of our thought to another occasion we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand man as a point of departure not progress as an end without those two forces who share their two motors faith and love
progress is the goal the ideal is the type
what is this ideal
it is god
ideal absolute perfection infinity identical words
chapter vii precautions to be observed in blame history and philosophy have eternal duties which are at the same time simple duties to combat call has the high priest draco the lawgiver grimaldi on the legislator tiberius the emperor this is clear direct and limpid and offers no obscurity
but the right to live apart even with its inconveniences and its abuses insists on being states and taken into account
denon irish isa human problem
when one speaks of convents those abodes of error but of innocence of an ervation but of goodwill of ignorance but of devotion of torture but if martyrdom it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no
a convent is a contradiction
its object salvation its means there to sacrifice
the convent us supreme egoism having for its result supreme abnegation
to abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of monasticism
in the cloister one suffers in order to enjoy
one draws a bill of exchange on death
one discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light
in the cloister hell is accepted in advance as a post on it on paradise
the taking of the veil of the trick is a suicide paid for with eternity
it does not seem to us that on such a subject mockery is permissible
all about it is serious the good as well as the bad
the justman crowne but never smiles with a malicious sneer
we understand wrath but not malice
chapter viii faith law a few words more
we blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues we despise the ski ritual which is harsh toward the temporal but we everywhere honor the thoughtful man
we salute the man who kneels
av with this is a necessity for man
woe to him who believes nothing
one is not unoccupied because one is absorbed
there is visible labor and invisible labor
to contemplate is to labor to think is to act
folded arms tool clasped hands work
a base fixed in heaven is a work
thales remained motionless for four years
he founded philosophy
in our opinion cenobites are not lazy men and recluses are not idle ed
to meditate on the shadow is a serious thing
without invalidating anything that we have just said we believe that a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper for the living
on this point the priest and the philosopher agree
we must die
the abbe de la trappe replies to horace
in this respect the ascetic and the cage converge
there is a material growth we admit it
there is a moral grandeur we hold to that
thoughtless and vivacious spirits say what is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery
what purpose do they serve
what do they do
alas
in the presence of the darkness which environs us and which awaits us in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make of us we reply there is probably no work more divine than that performed by these souls
and we are there is probably no work which is more useful
there certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never pray at all
in our opinion the whole question lies on the amount of thought that is mingled with prayer
leibnitz praying is grand voltaire adoring is fine
delete sit voltaire
we are for religion as against religions
we are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of prisons and the sublimity of prayer
moreover at this minute which we are now traversing a minute which will not fortunately leave its impress on the nineteenth century at this your when so many men have low brows and souls but little elevated among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment and who are busier with the brief and misshapen things of matter who ever exiles himself seems worthy of veneration tour
the monastery is a renunciation
sacrifice wrongly directed is still sacrifice
to mistakes grave error for a duty has a grandeur of its own
taken by itself and ideally and in order to examine the truth in all sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted the monastery the female convent in particular for in our century it is women who suffers the most and in this exile of the cloister there is something of protects to on the female convent has incontestably a certain majesty
this cloistered existence which is so austere so depressing a few of whose features we have just traced is not live for it is not liberty it is not the tomb for it is not plenitude it is the strange places hence one behold was from the crest of a lofty mountain on one side the abyss where we are on the other the abyss whither we shall go it is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds illuminated and obscured by both at the same time where the day of life which has become enfeebled is mingled with the vague day of death it is the half obscurity of the tomb
we who do not believe what these women believe but who like them live by faith we have never been able to think without a sort of tender and religious terror without a sort of pity that is full of envy of those devoted trembling and trusting creatures of these humble and august souls who dare to dwell on the very brink of the mystery waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is not get open turned towards the light which one can not few possessing the sole happiness of thinking that they know where it is aspiring towards the gulf and the unknown their eyes fixed motionless on the darkness kneeling bewildered stupefied shuddering half lifted at times by the deep breaths of eternity
book eighth
cemeteries take that which is committed them chapter k which treats of the manner of entering a convent it was into this house that jean valjean had a stay fuel event expressed it fallen from the sky
he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue po ponceau
that hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night was the nine changing matins that hall of which he had caught a glimpse of the gloom was the chapel
cosette once put to bed jean valjean and rauch eleventh adds we have already seen supper on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good crackling fire then the only bed in the hit being occupied by cosette each threw himself in a truss of straw
before he shut his eyes jean valjean said i must remain here henceforth
to tell the truth neither of them slept
jean valjean feeling that he was discovered and that is very was on his scent understood that he and cosette were lost if they returned to paris
then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister
jean valjean had henceforth but one thought to remain there
now for an unfortunate man in his position this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places the most dangerous because as nomen might enter there if he were discovered it was a flagrant offence and jean valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison the safest because if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there who would ever seek him in such a place
to dwell in an impossible placed as safety
on his side raychel event was due telling his brains
he began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter
how harm
madeleine got there when the walls were what they were
cloister walls are not to be stepped over
how did he get there with a child
who was that child
where did they both come from
since raychel event had lived in the convent he had heard nothing of m
shrm
and he knew nothing of what had taken place there
father madeleine had a hair which discouraged questions and besides raychel events and to himself one does not questions saint
m
only from some words which jean valjean had left all the gardener thought he could draw the inference that m
madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times and that he was pursued by his creditors or that he had compromised himself in some political affair and was in hiding which last did not displeased such el event who like many of our peasants of the north had an old fund off on a part i am about him
while in hiding m
madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there
but the inexplicable point to which gauche le vent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain was that m
madeleine should be there and that he should have that little girl with him
f such el event saw them touched them spoke to them and still did not believe it possible
raychel event gripes about amid conjectures and could see nothing clearly but this h
madeleine saved my life
this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course
he said to himself it is my turn now
he added in his conscience m
madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out
he made up his mind to save m
madeleine
nevertheless he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies after what he did for me would leave him if he were a thief
just the same
if he were an assassin would leave him
just the same
since he is a saint shall leave him
just the same
but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent
raychel event did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his self devotion his goodwill and a little of that old rustic cunning on this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister and the steep escarpments of the rule of saint benoit
father raychel event was an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who towards the end of his days halton firm with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grateful and perceiving a generous action to be performed flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment when he is dying should find close to his hands glass of good wine which he had never tasted and should swallow it with avidity
we may add that the air which he has breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him and has ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him
so he took his resolve to devote himself tom
madeleine
we have just called him a poor peasant of picardy
that description is just but incomplete
he was a peasant but he had been a notary which added trickery to his cunning and penetration to his ingenuousness
having through various causes failed in his business he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer
but in spite of oaths and lashings which horses seem to require something of the notary had lingered in jim
he had some natural with stalked good grammar me conversed which is a rare thing in a village and the other peasants said of him he talks almost like a gentleman with a hat
raychel event belonged in fact to that species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi bourgeois demil out and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticketed in the pigeon hole of the plebeian rather rustic rather sit ified pepper and salt
raychel event though sorely tried and harshly used by date worn out a sort of poor threadbare old soul was nevertheless an impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked
mus defects and his vices for he had some were all superficial in short how physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer
j k eager face had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify malice or stupidity
at daybreak father rauch fl event opened his eyes after having done an enormous deal of thinking and be held m
f auch so events at up and said now that you are here howard you going to contrive to enter
this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his revert
the two men took counsel together
in the first place said raychel event you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber either you or the child
one step in the garden and we are done for
that is true
monsieur madeleine resumed gauche le vent you have arrived at a very suspicious moment i mean to say a very inauspicious moment one of the ladies is very ill
this will prevent them from looking much in our direction
it seems that she is dying
the prayers of the forty hours are being said
the whole community is in confusion
that occupies the m
the one who is on the point of departure is a saint
we shall be at peace here for today but i will not answer for tomorrow
still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are trees it is not visible from the convent
and i add that the nuns never come near it
well
said jean valjean
the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified it seems to me that one may remain concealed here
it was to this interrogation point that raychel event responded there are the little girls
what little girls
asked jean valjean
just as raychel event opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered a bell emitted one stroke
the gun is dead said he
there is the knell
and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen
the bell struck a second time
it is the knell monsieur madeleine
the bell will continue to strike once a minute for twenty four hours until the body is taken from the church
you see they play
at recreation hours it suffices to have a ball rolls side to send them all higher in spite of prohibitions to hunt and rummage for it all about here
those cherubs are devils
who
asked jean valjean
the little girls
you would be very quickly discovered
a man
there will be no recreation hour
the day will be entirely devoted to prayers
you hear the bell
as i told you a stroke each minute
it is the death knell
i understand father raychel event
there are pupils
raychel event exclaimed la reine
there are little girls indeed
and they would bawl around you
and they would rush off
to be a man here is to have the plague
you see how they fasten a bell to my law as though i were a wild beast
jean valjean fell into mode and more profound thought
this convent would be our salvation he murmured
then he raised his voice yes the difficulty is to remain here
mosaic gauche p event the difficulty is to get out
jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart
to get out
yes monsieur madeleine
in order to return here it is first necessary to get out
and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded raychel event went on you must not be found here in this fashion
whence come you
for me you fall from heaven because i know you buy the nuns require one to dryer by the door
all at once they heard a rather complicated leaking from another bell
aj
said gauche k event they are ringing up the vocal mothers
they are going to the chapter
they always hold a chapter when anyone dies
she died at daybreak
people generally do die at daybreak
but can not you get out by the way in which you entered
come i do not ask for the sake of questioning you but how did you get in
jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder
you make your way out of a forest filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither
jean valjean pictures to himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his collar have that the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps
impossible
said he
father gauche le vent say that i fell from the sky
but i believe it i believe it retorted caucus le vent
you have no need to tell me that
the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped you
come there goes another peak that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead doctor is to come here and view a corpse
all that is the ceremony of dying
these good ladies are not at all four of that visit
a doctor is a man who does not believe in anything
he lifts the veil
sometimes he lifts something else too
how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time
what is the matter
your little one is still asleep
what is her name
cosette
she is your daughter
you are her grandfather that is
yes
it will be easy enough for her to get out of here
i have my service door which opens on the courtyard
i knock
the porter opens i have my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out
father raychel event goes out with his basket that is perfectly natural
you will tell the child to keep very quiet
she will be under the cover
i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friends fruit seller whom i know in the rue chem invert who is deaf and who has a little bed
then the little one will reenter with you for i will contrive to have you reenter
it must be done
but how will you manage to get out
jean valjean shook his head
no one must see me the whole point lies there father faith eleven t
find some means of getting me out in a basket undercover like cosette
raychel event scratched the love of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand as it not serious embarrassment
a third peak created a diversion
that is the dead doctor taking his departure said raychel event
if it is another them others lay her out if she is a sister the sisters lay her out
after which in all her up
a gardener is a bit of a grave digger
she is placed in a lower hall of the church which commun usages with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead
it is in that hall that in all up the coffin
they fetch a box with nothing in it they take it away again with something in it
de profundis
a horizontal day of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light
jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her
he was no longer listening to raychel event
that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence
the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his nabble the grave is dug in the vaugirard cemetery
they declare that they are going to suppress that vaugirard cemetery
it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire
it is a shame for it is convenient
i have a friend there father me etienne the grave digger
the nuns tree possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall
there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf
but how many events have happened since yes terran
mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly
gauche le vent caught the word
goodness
if you were here for gold it would be a real burial
a fourth psal burst out
raychel event hastily detached the belief kneecap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again
this time it is for me
the mother prioress wants me
good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle
something new had come up
if you are hungry there is a one bread and cheese
and he hastened out of the hot crying coming
coming
jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch
less than ten minutes later father raychel event who we fell out the nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice replied forever
forever
that is to say enter
the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business
this park lead joined the chapter hall
the prioress seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for raychel event
chapter ii gauche legend in the presence of a difficulty it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuns to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions
at the moment when raychel event entered this double form of preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress who was that wise and charming mademoiselle de bien sur mother innocente who was ordinarily cheerful
the gardener made a timid bow and remained at the door of the cell
the prioress who was telling her beads raised her eyes and said am
it is yours the real vent
this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent
raychel event bowed again
father day vent i have sent for you
here i am reverend mother
i have something to say to you
and so have i said raychel event with a boldness which caused him inward terror i have something to say to the very reverend mother
the prioress stared at him
ah
you have a communication to make home
a request
very well speak
goodman raychel event the ex notary belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance
a certain clever ignorance constitutes a force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it
raychel event had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent
always solitary and by died about his garden inn he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity
as he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before him only an agitation of shadows
by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh and those corpses were alive for him
he was like a dead man whose sight grows keener and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute
he had applied himself to fiddling out the significance of the different peaks and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatical cloister possessed no secrets for him the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear
faust eleven time wall and concealed all that constituted his art
the whole convent thought him stupid
a great merit in religion
the vocal mothers made much of raychel event
he was a curious mute
he inspires confidence
moreover he was regular and never went out except for well demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden
this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit
nonetheless he had set two men to shattering the ported in the convent and he knew the singularities of their parlor and the grave digger at the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their sepulture in this way he possessed a double light on the subject of these munson was to their life the other as to their death
but he did not abuse his knowledge
the congregation tt ought a great deal of him
old lake blind to everything probably a little deaf into the bargain what qualities
they would have found it difficult to replace him
the good man with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress
he talked a longtime about his age his infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demands of his work of the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had been obliged to put straw hats over the melon beds because of the moon and he wound up as follows that he had a brother the prioress made a movements brother no longer young a second movement on the part of the prioress but one expressive of reassurance that if he might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help him that he was an excellent gardener that the community would receive from him good service better than his own that otherwise if his brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged greatly to his regret to go away and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him who might be geared for god in the house and who might who knows become an in some day
when he had finished speaking the prioress stayed the slipping other rosary between her fingers and said to him could you procure a shout iron bar between now and this evening
for what purpose
to serve as a lever
yes reverend mother replied raychel event
the prioress without adding a word rose and entered the adjoining room which was the hall of the chapter and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled
rauch fl event was left alone
chapter iii mother innocente about a quarter of an hour elapsed
the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair
the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied
we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
father day vent
reverend mother
do you know the chapel
i have a little cafe there where i hear the mass and the offices
and you have been in the child in pursuance of your duties
two or three times
there is as to me to be raised
heavy
the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
the slab which closes the vault
yes
it would be a good thing to have two men for it
mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you
a woman is never a man
we have only a woman here to help you
each one does what he can
because comma bill on gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while merloni shoes tits only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise ye globus horatius
neither do i
a cloister is not a dockyard
and a woman is not a man
but my brother is the strong one though
and can you get a lever
that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door
there is a ring in the stone
i will put the order through it
and the stone is so arranged that its wings on a pivot
that is good reverend mother
i will open the vault
and the four mother present irs will help you
and when the vault is open
it must be closed again
will that beall
no
give me your orders very reverend mother
baigent we have confidence in you
i am here to do anything you wish
and to hold your peace about everything
yes reverend mother
when the vault is open i will close it again
but before that what reverend mother
something must be lowered into it
a silence ensued
the prioress after ap out of the under lip which resembled hesitation broke it
gather day vent
reverend mother
you know that a mother died this morning
no
did you not hear the bell
nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden
really
i can hardly distinguish my own signal
she died at daybreak
and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
it was mother crucifixion
a blessed woman
the prioress paused moved her lips as though in mental prayer and resumed three years ago madame de bethune a jansenist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer
ah
yes now i hear the knell reverend mother
the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church
i know
no other man than you can or just enter that changer
see to that
a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room
more often
hey
more often
what do you say
i say more often
more often than what
reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
why do you say more often
in order to speak like you reverend mother
amen said raychel event
the clock struck opportunely
it cut more often short
it is probable that had it not been for this end of korea sandra uchel event would never have unravelled that skein
gauch eleven flopped his forehead
the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred then raised her voice in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles
she will
replies father raychel event falling into step and striving not to flinch again
father day vent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion
no doubt it is not granted to everyone to die like cardinal de beguile while saying the holy mass and to breathe forth their souls to god while pronouncing these words mancini the oblation em
she regained her consciousness to the very last moment
she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels
she gave us her last commands
if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it
she smiled
we felt that she was regaining her life in god
there was something of paradise in that death
f auch so event thought that it was an prison which she was finishing
amen said he
father day vent what the dead wish must be done
the prioress took off several beads other chaplet
raychel event held his peace
she went on i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy themselves in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden
besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint
like yourself reverend mother
she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii
the one who crowned the enp buonaparte
for a clever man like raychel event this allusion was an awkward one
fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
she continued father day vent
reverend mother
saint did it is archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb a car us which signifies a work of the earth this was done
is this true
yes reverend mother
the blessed mezzo came abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the gallows this was done
that is true
saint terentius bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of par divides in the hope that passersby would spit in his tomb
this was done
the dead must be obeyed
done it
the body of bernard guidon is born in france near roche abeille was as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guido his was bishop of guy in spain
can the contrary be affirmed
for that matter no reverend mother
the fact is attested by plant a bit de la fosse
several heads of the chaplet were told off still in silence
the prioress resumed father day vent mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she has slept for the last twenty years
that is just
it is a continuation of her slumber
so i shall have to nail up that coffin
yes
precisely
i am at the orders of the very reverend community
the four mother present irs will assist you
in mailing up the coffin
i do not need them
no
in lowering the coffin
where
into the vault
what vault
under the altar
raychel event started
the vault under the altar
under the altar
but you will have an iron bar
yes but you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring
but the dead must be obeyed
to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked if it is that is to say commanded us
but it is forbidden
forbidden by men enjoined by god
what if it became known
we have confidence in you
oh
i am a stone in your walls
the chapter assembled
the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin under our altar
think father day vent if she were to work miracles here
what a glory of god for the community
and miracles issue from tombs
but reverend mother of the agent of the sanitary commission saint benoit ii
in the matter of sepulture resisted constantine logon at us
but the commissary of police cho node maire one of the seven german kings who entered among the fails under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
but the inspector from the prefecture the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
martin the eleventh general of the carthusians have to his order this devices far cry drum volvo the orbis

any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long
on the way when the rhetorician gymnast or as left his prison bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms study had struck in he halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it
the prior see who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the loquacity of adam which has broken away i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard
who was bernard
the first abbot of clairvaux
fontaines in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth
his father was named texel in and his mother ale the
regulated the temple preached the crusade performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime and as many as thirty nine in one day
who was benoit
he was the patriarch of mont cassin he was the second founder of the saints tefl australe he was the basil of the west
his order has produced forty popes two hundred cardinals fifty patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishops four thousand six hundred bishops four emperors twelve empresses for the id kings forty one queens three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
on one side saint benoit on the other the inspector of public days
the state the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the administration what do we know of all that
there is not a chance passerby who would not be indignant to see how we are treated
we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ
your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention
god subordinated to the commissary of police such is the age
silence day vent
raychel event was but ill at ease under this shower bath
the prioress continued no one doubts the right of the monastery to sepulture
only fanatics and those in error deny it
we live in times of terrible confusion
we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore
we are ignorant and impious
in this are there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century
others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi
to the cross of jesus christ
louis xvi
was merely a king
let us beware of god
there is no longer just not unjust
the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar rebus

the name of father coton is known not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the orator is but because he furnished henri iv
the huguenot king with the material for an oath
that which pleases people of the world in saint francois de sales is that he cheated at play
and then religion is attacked
why
because there have been bad priests because sagittaire bishop of gap was the brother of saline bishop of embrun and because both of them followed him mol
what has that to do with the question
does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar
they persecute the saints
they shut their eyes to the truth
darkness is the rule
the most ferocious beast wars beasts which are hi ind
no one thinks of hell as a reality
oh
how wicked people are
by order of the king signifies today by order of the resolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead
a holy death is prohibited
burial is a civil matter
this is horrible
saint leo ii
write two special letters one to pierre not sure the other to the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead the authority of the exarch and the supremacy of the emperor
gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against it to duke of burgundy
the ancient magistracy agreed with him
in former times we had voices in the chapter even on matters of the day
the abbot of citeaux the general of the order was councillor by right of birth to the parliament in burgundy
we do what we please without dead
is not the body of saint benoit himself in france in the abbey of fleury called saint benoit sur loire although he died in italy at mont cassin on saturday guest of the month of march of the year
all this is incontestable
i abhor psalm singers i hate prior suexec rate heretics but i should detect get more anyone who should maintain the contrary
the prioress took breath then turned to raychel event
is it settled father day vent
it is settled reverend mother
we may depend on you
i will obey
that is well
i am entirely devoted to the convent
that is understood
you will close the coffin
the sisters will carry it to the chapel
the office for the dead will then he said
then we shall return to the cloister
all will be done in the most profound secrecy
there will be in the chapel only the four mother prevent or another ascension and yourself
and the sister at the post
she will not turn round
but she will head
she will not listen
besides what the cloister knows the world learns not
a pause ensued
the prioress went on you will remove your help
it is not necessary that the sister at the list should perceive your presence
reverend mother
what father day vent
has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
the peel which offers the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been rung
but you do not understand any of the peaks
i pay no attention to any but my own
that is well father fak vent
reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required
where will you obtain it
where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking
i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
about three quarters of an hour before midnight do not forget
reverend mother
what
if you were ever to have any other jobs of this soft my brother is the strong man for you
a perfect turk
you will do it as speedily as possible
i can not work very fast
i am inform that is why i require an assistant
i limp
to link is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing
the emperor henry ii
who combated anti pope gregory and reestablished benoit viii
has two surnames the saint and the lake
two sur tours are a good thing murmured gauche le vent who really was a little hard of hearing
now that i think of it father day vent let us give a whole hour to it
that is not too much
the office begins at midnight
everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community
these are my orders
i am to nail up the coffin
the mother present irs will be there
mother ascension will be there
two men would be better
however nevermind
i shall have my lever
we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and we will close the vault again
after which there will be no trace of anything
the government will have no suspicion
thus all has been arranged reverend mother
no
what else remains
the empty coffin remains
this produced a pause
raychel event meditated
the prioress meditated
what is to be done with that coffin father day vent
it will be given to the earth
empty
another silence
raychel event made with his left hand that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject
reverend mother i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church and no one can enter the debut myself and i will cover the coffin with the pall
yes but the bearers when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grant will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it
ah
these
exclaimed raychel event
the prioress began to make the sign of the cross and looked fixedly at the gardener
the vip stuck fast in his throat
he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother
that will produce the effect of a corpse
you are right
earth that is the same thing as man
so you will manage the empty coffin
i will take that my sle ciao business
she made the sign of a superior dismissing an inferior to him
raychel event went towards the door
as he was on the point of passing out the prior was raised her voice gently i am pleased with you father day vent bring your brother to me tomorrow after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter
chapter iv in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castillejo the strides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
moreover gauche k event was in a dilemma
he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his city zus in the garden
cosette had wakes up
jean valjean had placed her near the fire
we must go away from this house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here
the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that
i shall come to fetch you
obey and say nothing above all things unless you want madame thenardier to get you again
cosette nodded gravely
jean valjean turned round at the noise made by raychel event opening the door
well
everything is arranged and nothing is said raychel event
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
it is easy enough with the child
you will carry her out
and she will hold her tongue
i answer for that
but you father madeleine
and after a silence fraught with anxiety raychel event exclaimed why get out as you came in
jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying impossible
raychel event grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean there is another thing which bothers me
i have said that i would put earth unit
the men will bear it
you understand father madeleine the government will notice it
jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
faux tel event went on how the deuce are you going to get out
it must all be done by tomorrow morning
it is tomorrow that i am to bring you in
the prioress expects you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he raychel event was to render to the community
that it fell among his duties to take part in their burials that he nailed up the coffins and helped the grave digger at the cemetery
that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
that the police regulations forbade this but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused
that the prioress and the vocal mothers intended to fulfil the wish of the deceased
that it was so much the worse for the government
that her aus bel event was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
and that by way of thanks the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil
that his brother was n
madeleine and that his niece was cosette
that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in these jersey
but that he could not bring m
madeleine in from the outside of m
madeleine was not outside
that that was the first problem
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin
asked mean value am
raychel event replied the coffin of the administration
what coffin
what administration
an undies
put something in it
a corpse
i have none
no
what then
a living person
what person
me
said jean valjean
raychel event who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair
you
why not
jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter
good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously
very seriously i must get out of this place
certainly
i have told you to find a basket and a cover for me also
well
the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth
in the first place it will be a white cloth
nuts are buried in white
let it be a white cloth them
you are not like other men gather madeleine
to behold such devices which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the valleys spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him and mingle with what he called the petty course of life in the convent caused raychel event as much amazement as a full fishing in the gutter of the rue saint denis would inspire in a passerby
jean valjean went on the problem is to get out of here without being seen
this offers the means
but give me some information in the first place
how is it manager
where is this coffin
the empty one
yes
downstairs in what is called the dead room
it stands on two trestles under the pell
how long is the coffin
six feet
what is this dead room
it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church
what church
the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
have you the keys to those two doors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
when does the porter porn that door
when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again
who nails up the coffin
i do
who spreads the pall over it

see you alone
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room
that is even written on the wall
could you give me in that room tonight when everyone is asleep
no
but i could give you in a small dark book which opens on the dead room where i keep my tools to use for burials and of which i have the key
at what time will the year second for the coffin tomorrow
the burial will take place at the vaugirard cemetery a little before nightfall
it is not very near
i will remain concealed in your tool closet all night and all the morning
and how about food
i shall be hungry
i will bring you something
raychel event recoiled and cracked his finger joints
but that is impossible
nah
impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
what seemed unprecedented today fuel events as we repeat a simple matter to jean valjean
jean valjean had been in worse straits than this
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to hit the diameter of the escape
the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him
an escape is a cure
what does not a man undergo for the sake of a cure
if we are to credit the monk austin castillejo this was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the plumbed for the last time after his abdication
he had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of saint yuste in this manner
faith el event who had recovered himself a little exclaimed but how will you manage to breathe
i will breathe
in that box
the mere thought of it suffocates me
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely
good
and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not count or sneeze
and jean valjean added father raychel event we must come to a decision i must either be caught here or accept this escape through the hearse
everyone has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door
who is there who has not said to a cat do come in
there are men who when an incident stands half open before them have the same tendency to halt in inc ecision between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by date
the over prudent cats as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
faux nel event was of this hesitating nature
he grumbled well since there is no other means
jean valjean resumed the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery
that is the very point that is not troublesome exclaimed gauche le vent
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
the grave digger is a drunkard and a friend of mine
he is rather me etienne
an old fellow of the old school
the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i will tell you what will take place
they will arrive a little before dusk three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed
the near we will drive directly up to the grave
i shall follow that is my business
i shall have a hammer a chisel and some pincers in my pocket
the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
i am left alone with father me etienne
he is my friend i tell you
one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
then you have no longer anyone but me to deal with
jean valjean held out his hand and caucus i event precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant
that is settled father raychel event
all will go well
provided nothing goes wrong thought raychel event
in that case it would be terrible
chapter v it is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passersby on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skills cross bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with dropping arms
a mourning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choirboy in his red cap followed
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who lim pedaling
the procession was going in the direction of the vaugirard cemetery
the vaugirard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris
it had its peculiar usages just as it had its carriage entrance and its house door which old people in the quarter who cling tenaciously to ancient words still called the ports cavaliers and the ports pie tonne
the bernard j new benedictines of the rue petit pico y z had obtained permission as we have already stated to be buried there in a corner apart and at night the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community
the gravediggers being thus bound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
the gates of the paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a municipal regulation the va unitard cemetery was bound by it like the rest
the carriage rare and the house door were two contiguous r rated gates adjoining a pavilion built by the architect petronet and inhabited by the door keeper of the cemetery
these gates therefore swung inexorably on their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalides
the grave digger dropped his card into this box the porter heard it fall pulled the food and the small door opened
if the man had not miss and he mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with his key the grave digger stepped out but had to pay a fine if fifteen france
this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration
it was suppressed a little later than
the vaugirard cemetery was what may be called a faded cemetery
it was falling into disuse
dampness was invading of the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the vaugirard it hinted at poverty
pere lachaise if you please
to be buried in pere lachaise is equivalent to having furniture of mahogany
it is recognized as elegant
the vaugirard cemetery was a venerable enclosure planted like an old fashioned french garden
straight alleys box thuya trees holly ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees and very tall grass
in the evening it was tragic there
there were very lugubrious lines about it
the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white pali and the black cross entered the avenue of the vaugirard cemetery
the lame man who followed it was no other than gauche levert
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the editor cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been to hitch
let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly denial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an inter meddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
in the first place the rule as for the code we shall see
make as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to god
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
raychel event limped along behind the head as in a very spm tented trans of mind
his twin plots the one with the nuns the one for the convent the other against it the other with m
madeleine had succeeded to all appearance
raychel event no longer felt doubtful as to his success
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
within the last two years he had made good father me etienne a chubby cheeked person drunk at least ten times
he played with father me etienne
he did what he liked with him
he made him dance according to his whom
all at once the headset alter it had reached the gate
the permission for interment must be exhibited
during this colloquy which always is productive of a delay or from one to two minutes someone a stranger came and placed himself behind the hearse beside raychel event
he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
raychel event surveyed this stranger
who are you
he demanded
the man replied the grave digger
if a man could survive the flow of a cannonball fill in the breast he would make the same face that caucus le vent made
the grave digger
yes
you
i
father me etienne is the grave digger
he was
what
he was
he is dead
raychel event had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that gravediggers dodie themselves
raychel event stood there with his mouth wide open
he had hardly the strength to stammer but it is not possible
it is so
but he persisted feebly father me etienne is the grave digger
after napoleon louis xviii
after me etienne try bier
peasant my name is bribie r
raychel event who was deadly pale stared at this fri view
he was at all think i did utterly funereal man
he had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave digger
faucheur vent burst out laughing
ah
said he whats user things do happen
father me etienne is dead guy long live little father lenoir
do you know who little father lenoir is
he is a jug of red wine
it is a jug of eugene morbi you
of real ladies irene
ah
coolfm estienne is dead
i am sorry for it he was a jolly fellow
but you are a jolly fellow top
are you not comrade
the man replied i have been a student
i passed my fourth examination
i never drink
the hearse had set out again and was rolling up the brandalley of the cemetery
rauch eleventh as slackened his pace
he limped more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digger walked on in front of him
raychel event passed the unexpected grobler once more in review
he was one of those men who though very young have the air of age and who though slender are extremely strong
comrade
cried raychel event
the man turned round
i am the convent grave digger
my colleague said the man
f such el event who was illiterate got very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker
he muttered so far term estienne is dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up
father me etienne died
raychel event repeated mechanically the glory of the good god said the man authoritatively
according to the philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme being
stammered raychel event
it is made
you are a peasant i am a parisian
people do not know each other until they have drunk together
he who emptied his glass emptied his heart
you must come and have a drink with me
such a thing can not be refused
business first
rauch elegent thought i am post
the grave digger resumed peasant i have seven small children who must be fed
as they must say i can not drink
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase well their number is the enemy of my thirst
the heaters lifted a clump of cypress trees quitted the grand alley turned into a narrow one entered the wasteland and plunged into a thicket
this indicates the immediate proximity of the place of sepulture
raychel event slackened his pace but he could not detain the hearse
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
he approached the grave digger
they have such a nice little argenteuil wine murmured raychel event
villager retorted the man i ought not be a grave digger
my father was a porter at theory tan dun town hall
he destined me for literature
but he had reversed
i was obliged to renounce the profession of author
but i am still a public writer
so you are not a grave digger then
returned raychel event clutching at this branch feeble as it was
the one does not hinder the other
i cumulate
faust elegant did not understand this last word
some have a drink said he
here are mark becomes necessary
raychel event whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
generally raychel event offered and father me etienne paid
an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave digger and it was necessary to make this offer but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark and that not unintentionally
as for himself raichel event did not wish to pay troubled as he was
the grave digger went on with a superior smile one must eat
one gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly complete cgis classes
to the labor of the hand i join the labor of the arm
you know
the umbrella marist
all the cooks of the red cross apply to me
i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers
in the morning i write love letters in the evening i dig graves
such is life rustic
the hearse was still advancing
raychel event in easy to the last degree was gazing about him on all sides
great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow
but continued the grave digger a man can not serve two mistresses
i must choose between the pen and the mattock
the mattock is ruining my hand
the hearse halted
the choirboy alighted from the mourning coach then the priest
one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible
what a farce this is
repeated faust do event in consternation
chapter vi between four planks who was in the coffin
the reader knows
jean valjean
jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there and he could almost breathe
it is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest
every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progressing and progressing favorably since the preceding day
he liked such el event counted on father me etienne
he had no doubt as to the end
never was there a more critical situation never more complete composure
the four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace
from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow and he had followed all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death
shortly after raychel event had finished mailing on the upper plank jean valjean had felt himself carried out then driven off
he knew from the diminution in the jolting when they left the pavements and reached the earth road
he had divined from a full noise that they were crossing the bridge of austerlitz
at the first half he had understood that they were entering the cemetery at the second half he said to himself here is the grave
suddenly he felt hands seize the coffin then anarchy rating against the piano she explained it to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity
then he experienced a giddiness
he recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless
he had just touched the bottom
he had a certain sensation of cold
a voice rose above him glacial and solemn
he heard latin words which he did not understand pass over him so slowly that he was able to catch them one by one qui for mounting edta would free vigil a bunt a liking it a master name talk i inappro fri unit did rant semper
the grave voice began again requiem aeternam don as i do mine
he heard something like the gentle patter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered tim
it was probably the holy water
he thought this will be over soon now
patience for a little while longer
the priest will take his departure
raychel event will take me etienne off to drink
i shall be left
the new uchel event will return alone and i shall get out
that will be the work of a good hour
the grave voice resumed requiescat in pace
jean valjean strained his ears and heard something like retreating footsteps
there they are going now though the
i am alone
all at once he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a slap of thunder
it was a shovelful of earth falling on the coffin
a second shovelful fell
one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up
a third shovelful of earth fell
then a fourth
there are things which are too strong for the strongest man
jean valjean lost consciousness
when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choirboy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure catch eleven yeh i had not taken his eyes from the grave digger saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel which was sticking up right in the heap of dirt
the new uchel event took a supreme resolve
he placed himself between the grave and the grave digger crossed his arms and said i am the one to pay
raychel event repeated i am the one who pays
what
for the wine
what wine
that argenteuil wine
where is the argenteuil
at the bob doing
go to the devil
said the grave digger
and he flung a shovelful of earth on the coffin
the coffin gave back a hollow sound
raychel event felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself
he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle comrade
before the bond king is shut
the grave digger took some more earth on his shovel
gauche ledent continued
i will pay
listen to be comrade
i am the convent grave digger i have come to help you
it is a business which can be performed at night
let us begin then by going for a drink
and as he spoke and clung to this desperate insistence this melancholy reflection occurred to him and if he drinks will he get drunk
provincial said the man if you positively insist upon it i consent
we will drink
after work never before
and he flourished his shovel briskly
raychel event held him back
it is argenteuil wine at six
oh come said the grave digger you are a bell ringer
go hang yourself
and he threw in a second shovelful
fx uchel event had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying
come along and drink he cried since it is i who pays the bill
when we have put the child to bed said the grave digger
he flung in a third shovelful
at that moment as he loaded his shovel the grave digger bent over and the pocket or his waist spagna psd
the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket
an idea had just occurred to him
he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the grave digger who was wholly absorbed into a shovelful of earth observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it
the man santa fourth shovelful tumbling into the trade
just as he turned round to get the fifth raychel event looked calmly at him and said by the way you newman have you your card
the grave digger paused
what card
the sun is on the point of setting
the gate of the cemetery will close immediately
well what then
have you your card
ah
my card
said the grave digger
and he fumbled in his pocket
having searched one pocket he proceeded to search the other
he passed onto his to be explored the first returned to the second
why no said he i have not my card
i must have forgotten it
fifteen france fine said raychel event
the grave digger turned green
green is the pallor of livid people
ah
jesus job dirk van croche a bad la lune
he exclaimed
fifteen france fine
three pieces of a hundred so he said raychel event
the grave digger dropped his shovel
at come now conscripts side such eleventh one of this despair
there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grave
fifteen francais fifteen france and besides you may not be able to pay it
i am an old hand you are a new one
i know all the ropes and the devices
i will give you some friendly advice
one thing is clear the sun is on the point of setting it is touching the somehow the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more
that is true replied the man
five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave it is as hollow as the devil this grave and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut
that is true
in that case a fine of fifteen france
fifteen france
but you have time
where do you live
a couple of steps from the barrier a quarter of an hour from here
no
rue de vaugirard
you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed
that is exactly so
once outside the gate you gallop time you get your card you return the cemetery porter admits you
as you have your card there will be nothing to pay
and you will bury your corpse
i am indebted to you for my life peasant
decamp
said raychel event
the grave digger overwhelmed with gratitude shook his hand and set off on a run
when the man had disappeared in the thicket raychel eventlistener until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance then he leaned over the grave and said in a low tone father madeleine
there was to reply
raychel event was seized with a shudder
i stumbled rather than climbed into the grave flung himself in the head of the coffin and cried are you there
silence in the coffin
raychel event hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his cold chisel and his hammer and pride up the coffin iid
he stared at jean valjean
jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless
raychel event murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh he is dead
and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulder she cried and this is the way i save his life
then the poor man fell to sobbing
he so lilo quizes the while for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural
powerful emotion often talks aloud
why did that fool die
what needs as there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it
it is he who has killed m
madeleine
father madeleine
he is in the coffin
it is quite handy
all is over
now is there any sense in these things
ah
my god
he is dead
well
and his little girl what ami to do with her
what will the fruit seller say
the idea of its being possible for a man like that movie like this
when i think how he put himself under that cart
father madeleine
father madeleine
la reine
he was suffocated i said co
well
and his little girl
ah
i shall stay here
after having done such a thing as that
but in the first place how did he manage to enter the convent
that was the beginning of it all
one should not do such things
gather madeleine
father madeleine
father madeleine
madeleine
monsieur madeleine
monsieur lemaire
he does not hear me
now get out of this scrape if you can
and he tore his hair
a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance
it was the cemetery gate closing
raychel event bent over jean valjean and all at once he bounced back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit
to see a corpse is alarming to behold a resurrection is almost as much so
raychel event became limestone pale haggard over she knew by all these excesses of emotion not knowing whether he had to do with a living major area done and staring at jean valjean who was gazing at him
illustration the resurrection b resurrection i fell asleep said jean valjean
and he raised himself to a sitting posture
raychel event fell on his knees
just good virgin
how you frightened me
then he sprang to his feet and cried thanks father madeleine
jean valjean had merely fainted
the fresh air has revived him
joy is the ebb of terror
raychel event found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean has
so you are not dead
oh
how wise you are
i called you so much that you came back
they would have put it in vidette
what do you suppose i should have done if you had been dead
and your little girl
the child is thrust into your arms and then the grandfather is dead
what a story
good saints of paradise what a tale
ah
i am cold said jean valjean
this remark recalled raychel event thoroughly to reality and there was pressing need of it
the souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves although they did not realize it and there was about them something uncanny which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place
let us get out of here quickly exclaimed raychel event
he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a gourd with which he had provided himself
but first take a drop said he
the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties
he got out of the coffin and helped raychel event to nail on the kid again
three minutes later they were out of the grave
more over raychel event was perfectly composed
he took his time
the cemetery was closed
the arrival of the grave digger grobler was not to be apprehended
without a card he could not get back into the cemetery
raychel event took the shovel and jean valjean the pickaxe and together they buried the empty coffin
when the grave was full raychel events aid to jean valjean let us to
i will keep the shovel do you carry off the mattock
night was falling
jean valjean experienced rome difficulty in moving and in walking
he had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a corpse
the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks
he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb
you are benumbed said raychel event
it is a pity that i have a game key for otherwise we might step out briskly
bah
replies jean valjean four paces will put life into my legs once more
they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed
how well everything is going
said gauche legend what a capital idea that was of yours father madeleine
they passed the vaugirard barrier in the comp or at manner in the world
in the neighborhood of the cemetery a shovel and pick are equal to two passports
the rue vaugirard was deserted
father madeleine said raychel event as they went along and raising his eyes to the houses your eyes are better than none
show me no
here it is said jean valjean
there is no one in the street said raychel event
give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me
raychel event entered no
ascended to the very top guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the target and knocked in the dark at the door of an attic
a voice replied come in
raychel event opened the door
a packing case a coffin perhaps took the place of a commodes butter pot served for a drinking fountain a straw mattress served for a bed the floor served instead of tables and chairs
in a corner on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap
the whole of this poverty stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned
one would have said that there had been an earthquake for one
the covers were displaced the rags scattered about the jun broken the mother had been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous and ill tempered search
it was plain that the grave digger had made a desperate search for his card and had made everybody in the garret from them into his wife responsible for its loss
he wore an air of desperation
but raychel event was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success
he entered and said i have brought you back your shovel and pick
bribie r gazed at him in stupefaction
is if you peasant
and tomorrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery
and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor
what is the meaning of this
demanded grobler
the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out if your pocket that i found it on the ground after you were done that i have buried the corpse that i have filled the grave that i have done your work that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have to pay for teen france
there you have it conscript
thanks villages
exclaimed grub i ef radiant
the next time i will pay for the drinks
chapter viii a successful interrogatory an hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented themselves at no
the petit pic pic
the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped
they were raychel event jean valjean and cosette
cosette had passed these twenty four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing
she trembled to such a degree that she wept
she had neither eaten not slept
the worthy fruit seller has poked her with a hundred questions without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze
cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days
she divined that they were passing through a crisis
she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good
who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words pronounced with a certain ascent in the war of a terrified little being say nothing
fear is mute
moreover no one guards a secret like a child
but when at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty four hours she beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any thoughtful person who had chances to hear that cry would have guessed that it issued from an abyss
raychel event belonged to the convent and knew the passwords
all the doors opened
this was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in
the porter admitted all three of them through this door and from that point they reached the inner reserved parlor where raychel event on the preceding day had received his orders from the prioress
the prioress rosary in hand was waiting for them
a vocal mother with her veil powered stood beside her
a discreet candlelight ed one might almost say have a show of lighting the parlor
the prioress passed jean valjean in review
there is nothing which examines like a downcast eye
then she questioned him you are the brother
yes reverend mother replied raychel event
what is your name
raychel event replied ultime faux tel event
he really had had a brother named ultime who was dead
where do you come from
raychel event replies from pic quinny near amiens
what is your age
rauch do event replied fifty
what is your profession
raychel event replied gardener
are you a good christian
raychel event replied everyone is in the family
is this your little girl
raychel event replied yes reverend mother
you are her father
raychel event replied her grandfather
the vocal mother said to the prioress in a low voice he answers sell
jean valjean had not uttered a single word
the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother she will grow up ugly
the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said father day vent you will get another one eval with a bell
two will be required now
on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their veils
at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two men eau vent and another man were visible as they dug side by side
an enormous event
their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other he is an assistant gardener
the vocal mothers added he is a brother of father day vent
jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belief kneecap henceforth he was official
his name was ultime raychel event
the prioress that pronounced prognosticator immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil
there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this
it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become runs the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty
hence a lively taste for plain girls
the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old rauch eleventh fw on a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom he had saved and sheltered in those of grave digger grobler who said to himself he spared me that fine with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god
there was a coffin containing a body in the petit pic pic and a coffin without a body in the vaugirard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby but no one was aware of it
as for the convent its gratitude to raychel event was very great
gauche p event became the best of servitors and the most precious of gardeners
on leaving the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper tom
this admiration for raychel event became widespread for it made its way to rome
we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope leo xii
nothing of this triumph reached raychel event in his but he went on grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds with out in the least suspect in this excellences and his sanctity
neither did he suspect his glory any more than a durham of surrey full whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news with this inscription bill which carried off the prize at the cattle show
chapter ix cloistered cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent
moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and then she would not have said anything in any case
as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness
cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to breathe
a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her
she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean
she speedily became accustomed to the convent
only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so
once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her away with me
cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to won the garb of the pupils of the house
jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside
it was not very threadbare even now
jean valjean locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a little valise which he found means of procuring
he set this valise on a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person
father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which smells so good
father gauche i event received other recompense for his good action in addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less work since it was shared
lastly as he was very fond of snuff he found the presence of m
madeleine an advantage in that he used three times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner seeing that m
madeleine paid for it
the guns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the other day vent
moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out
javert watches the quarter for more than a month
this convent was for jean valjean like a goal and surrounded by rules
henceforth those four walls constituted his world
he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy
a very sweet life began for him
heigh abides the old guy at the end of the garden in company with raychel event
this novel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in was composed as the reader already knows of three chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls
the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain tom
madeleine by father raychel event
jean valjean worked in the garden every day and made himself very useful
he had formerly been a primer of trees and he gladly found himself a gardener once more
it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture
he turned thereto advantage
almost all the trees in the orchard were in grafted and wild
he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit
cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day
as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and adored him
at the appointed hour she flew to the hut
when she entered the lowly cabins be filled it with paradise
jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette
the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing near re like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever
at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest
for cosette laughed now
the gloom had disappeared from it
a smile is the same as sunshine of banishes winter from the human countenance
recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her classroom and at both the rose to look at the windows other dormitory
it is certain that virtue adjoins price on one side
a bridge built by the devil exists there
jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the convent of their tit pic pic so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for sometime last he had been comparing himself to begin general and pride was beginning to spring up
who knows
he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred
the convent stopped him on that downward path
this was the second place of captivity which he had seen
in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had be held another at rightful place a terrible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law
now after the valley she saw the cloister and when he hesitated how he had formed a part of the valleys and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety
sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his god and slowly descended the endless spirals of revert
they lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered voices with a horn head e beneath the cudgel and in disgrace
then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes
these beings also lived with shorn beads with downcast eyes with lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scores of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders is created with their discipline
their names also had vanished from among men they no longer existed except under austere appellations
they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until evening without food they were attired not in a red blouse but in a black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having even according to the season there source of the linen garment of the woollen cloak and for six months in the year the two reserve chemises which gave them fever
they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw
and finally they were not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse themselves to rise and to go and pray in an ice cold and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones
on certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face up in the pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross
the others were men these were women
what had this when done
they had stolen violated pillaged murdered assassinated
they were bandits counterfeiters poisoners incendiaries murderers parricide s
what had these women done
they had done nothing whatever
on the one hand highway robbery fraud deceit violence sensuality homicide all sorts of sacrilege every variety of crime on the other one thing only innocence
perfect innocence almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption attached to the earth by virtue already possessing something of heaven through holiness
on the one hand confidence cover crimes which are exchanged in whispers in the other the confession of faults made a loud
and what crimes
and what faults
on the one hand miasma on the other an ineffable perfume
on the one hand a moral pest guarded from sight penned up under the range of cannon and literally devouring its plague stricken victims on the other the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth
there darkness here the shadow but a shadow filled with gleams of light and of gleams full of radiance
two strongholds of slavery but in the first deliverance possible a kayak limit always insight and then escape
in the second perpetuity the sole hope at the distant extremity of the future that faint light of liberty which men call death
on the first men are bound only with chains in the other chained by faith
what flowed from the first
an immense curse the gnashing of teeth hatred desperate viciousness a cry of rage against human society a sarcasm against heaven
what results flowed from the second
blessings and love
and in these two places so similar yet so unlike these two species of beings who were so very unlike were undergoing the same work expiation
but he did not understand that of these last that of creatures without reproach and without stain and he trembled as he asked himself the expiation of what
what expiation
a voice within his conscience replied the most divine of human gene gocities the expiation for others
before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation the highest possible pitch of virtue the innocence which pardon when their faults and which expiated in their stead servitude submitted to torture accepted punishment claimed by souls which have not signed for the sake of sparingly to souls which have fallen the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of god but even there per serving its distinct and mediatorial character sweet and feeble beings possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed
and he remembered that he had dared to murmur
often in the middle of the night he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy and that he wretch that he was had shaken his fist at god
there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply like a warning whisper from providence itself the scaling of thats all the passing of those barriers the adventure accepted even at the risk of death the painful and difficult ascent all those efforts even which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation he had made in order to gain entrance into this one
was this a symbol of his destiny
this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar
again he beheld gratings boots iron bars to guard whom
angels
these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers he now be held once more around lambs
this was a place of expiation and not of punishment and yet it was still more austere more gloomy and more pitiless than the other
these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts
a cold harsh wind that wind which had chilled his youth traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the cultures a still hatcher and more buying breeze blew in the care of these codes
why
when he thought on these things all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity
in these meditations his pride vanished
be scrutinized his own heart in all manner of way she felt his pettiness and many a time he wept
sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the wall which skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had based on the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer
thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister
it seemed as thong the dared not kneel directly before god
everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant flowers those children who uttered joyous cries those brave and simple women that silent cloister slowly permeated him and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children
and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life the first when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him the second at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him and when the valleys were again yawning and that had it not been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and has it not been for the second in to torment
his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more
many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up

to nuncio plautus would say
this little being is joyous
he has not good everyday and he goes to the play every evening if he sees good
he has no shirt on his body now goes on his feet no roof over his head he is like the files of heaven who have none of these things
this is because he has in his heart a pearl innocence and pearls are not to be dissolved in mid

if one were to ask that enormous city what is this
she would reply it is my little one
chapter ii some of his particular characteristics they am in the street arabic paris is the dwarf of the giant
let us not exaggerate this cherub of the butter sometimes has a short but in that case he owns but one he sometimes has shoes but then they have no sole she sometimes has a lodging and he loves it for he finds his mother there but he prefers the street because there he finds liberty
he has his own games his own bits of mischief whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois his peculiar metaphors to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root his own occupations calling hackney coaches letting down carriage steps establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains which he calls making the bridge of arts crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the french people cleaning out the cracks in the page kent he has his own coinage which is cp moores of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets
this curious money which receives the name of lo que stage has an invariable and well regulated currency in this little bohemia of children
he had his fabulous monster which has scales under its belly but is not a lizard which has pustules on its back but is not a road which inhabits the books of old limekilns and wells that have run dry which is black hairy sticky which crawls sometimes slowly sometimes rapidly which has no cry but which has a look and is so terrible that noone has ever beheld if he calls this monster the dead thing
the search for these dead things among the stones is a joy of formidable nature
another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a paving stone and taking a look at the woodlice
each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there
there are earwigs in the timber yards of the ursulines there are mille person the pantheon there are tadpoles in the witches of the champs de mars
as far as saying care concerned this child has as many of them as talleyrand
he is no less cynical but he is more honest
he is endowed with a certain indescribable unexpected joviality he upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter
he ranges boldly from high comedy to farce
a funeral passes by
among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor
hey there
shouts some street arab how long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work
another is in a crowd

theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air
it is in that keep that the titi huddle together
the titlist other am in what the moth is to the larva the same being endowed with wings and soaring

bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary and you have the gamin
the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition
his tendency and we say it with the proper amount of regret would not constitute classic taste
he is not very academic by nature
thus to give an example the popularity of mademoiselle mars among that little audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony
the gamin called her mademoiselle much rhode yourself
this being bawls and scoffs and ridiculed and fights has tags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher fishes in the sewer hunts in the cesspool extracts mirth from foulness whips up the squared with his wit grins and bites whistles and sings a hours and shrieks tempera alleluia with marangu route the change every rhythm from the de profundis to the jack pudding finds without seeking knows what he is ignorant of is a spartan to the point of thieving is mad to wisdom is lyrical to filth would crouch down on olympus wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars
the gamin of paris is rabelais in this youth
he is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch pocket
he is not easily astonished he is still less easily terrified he makes songs on superstition she takes the wind out of exaggerations gets its mysteries he thrusts out his tongue at ghost she takes the poetry out of stilted things he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas
it is not that he is prosaic far from that but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria
if adam actor were to appear to him the street arab would say hi there

chapter iv he may be of use paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street arab two beings of which no other city is capable the passive acceptance which contents itself with gazing and the inexhaustible initiative prudhomme and you i look
paris alone has this in its natural history
the whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger the whole of anarchy in the dam in
this pale child of the parisian faubourg slides and develops makes connections grows supple in suffering in the presence of social realities and of human things a thoughtful witness
he thinks himself heedless and he is not
he looks and is on the verge of laughter he is on the verge of something else also
whoever you may be if your name is prejudice abuse ignorance oppression iniquity despotism injustice fanaticism tyranny beware of the gaping gamin
the little fellow will grow up
of what clay is he made
of the first mud that comes to hand
a handful of dirt a breath and behold adam
it suffices for agosto pass by
a god has always passed over the street arab
fortune labors at this tiny being
by the word fortune we mean chance to some extent
that pigmy kneaded out of common earth ignorant unlettered giddy vulgar low
will that become an ionian or a boeotian
as it sure it rota the spirit of paris that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny reversing the process of the latino other makes of a huge n amphora
chapter v his frontiers the takin loves the city he also loves solitude since he has something of the safe in him
h rbi senator like fuscus eur is a mayor like flaccus
to roam thoughtfully about that is to say to lounge is a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher particularly in that rather illegitimate species of campaign which is tolerably ugly but odd and composed of two natures which surrounds certain great cities notably paris
to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal
end of the trees beginning of the roofs end of the grass beginning of the pavements end of the furrows beginning of the shops end of the wheel rugs beginning of the passions end of the divine murmur beginning of the human uproar hence an extraordinary interest
hence in these not very attractive places indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet melancholy the apparently object less promenades of the dreamer
he who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of paris and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs
that closest a venture those pebbly paths that chalk those pools those harsh mon ironies of waste and fallow land s the plants of early market garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom that mixture of the savage and the citizen those vast desert books where the garrison drums practice noisily and produce a sort of lisping of battle those hermits by day and cutthroats by night that clumsy mill which turns in the wins the hoisting wheels of the quarries the tea gardens at the corners of the cemeteries the mysterious charm of great sombre walls squarely intersecting immense vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full of butterflies all this attracted him
there is hardly anyone on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots the glaciers the dinette the hideous wall of grenelle all speckled with balls montparnasse the fosse audio up saunier won the bank of the marne montsouris the tombs issoire the pierre plate de chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms and which is closed on a level with the ground by a trap door of rotten planks
the campagna of rome is one idea the banlieue of paris is another to behold nothing but fields houses of trees in what a stretch of country offers us is to remain on the surface all aspects of things are thoughts of god
the spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy
nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there
local original ities there make their appearance
anyone who like ourselves has wandered about in these solitudes contiguous to our faubourg s which may be designated as the limbic of paris has seen here and there in the most desert spot at the most unexpected moment behind a meagre hedge or in the corner of a lugubrious wall children grouped tumultuously fetid muddy dusty ragged dishevelled playing hide and seek and crowned with cornflowers
all of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families
the outer boulevard is their breathing space the suburbs belong to them
there they are eternally playing truant
there they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs
there they are or rather there they exist far from every eye in the sweet light of major june kneeling found a hole in the ground snapping marbles with their thumbs quarrelling over half farthings irresponsible volatile free and happy and no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry and that they must earn their living and they offer to sell you an old woollen stocking filled with cock chafers or a bunch of lilacs
these encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of paris
sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys are they their sisters
who are almost young maiden a thin feverish with sunburnt hands covered with freckles crowned with poppies and ears of the gay haggard barefooted
they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat
in the evening they can be heard laughing
these groups warmly illuminated by the full flow of midday or indistinctly seen in the twilight occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time and these visions mingle with his dreams
paris centre banlieue circumference this constitutes all the earth to those children
they never venture beyond this
they can no more escape from the parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water
for them nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers ivry gentilly arcueil belleville aubervilliers menil montant choisy le roi billancourt mendon is suv and re sevres puteaux neuilly gennevilliers colombes domain ville chatou asnieres bougival nanterre enghien noisy of sec nogent gournay drancy gonesse the universe ends there
chapter vi a bit of history at the epoch nearly contemporary by the way when the action of this book takes place there was not as there is today a policeman at the corner of every street a benefit which there is no time to discuss here stray children abounded in paris
the statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period by the police patrols in unenclosed lands in houses in processor construction and under the arches of the bridges
one of these nests which has become famous produced the swallows of the bridge if arcola
this is more over the most disastrous of social symptoms
all crimes of the man begin in the vagabond age of the child
let us make an exception in favor of parish ever the less
in a relative measure and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled the exception is just
while in any other great city the vagabond child is a postman while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is in some sort sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devouring in honesty and conscience the street boy of parks we insist on this point however defaced and injured on the surface is almost intact on the interior
it is a magnificent thing to put on record and one which shines forth on the splendid probity of our popular revolutions that a certain incorrupt ibility results from the idea which exists in the air of paris as salt exists in the water of the ocean
to breathe paris preserves the soul
what we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one fancied that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family
in the civilization of the present day incomplete as it still is it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness not knowing clearly what had become of their children and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway
hence these obscure destinies
this is called for this sad thing has given rise to an expression to be cast on the pavements of paris
let it be said by the way that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy
a little of egypt and bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres and compasses the aims of the powerful
the hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma
what is the use of half lights
such was the countersign
now the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child
besides this the monarchy sometimes was in need of children and in that case it skimmed the streets
under louis xiv
not to go any further back the long rightly desired to create a fleet
the idea was a good one
but let us consider the means
there can be no fleet is beside the sailing ship that plaything of the winds and for the purpose of towing it in case of necessity there is not the vessel which does where it pleases either by means of oars or of steam the valleys were then to the marine what steamer care today
therefore valleys were necessary but the valley is moved only by the valley slave hence galley slaves were required
colbert had the commissioners of provinces and the parliament shake as many convicts as possible
the magistracy showed a great deal of complaisance in the matter
a man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession it was a guy is not attitude he was sent to the galleys
a child was encountered in the streets provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep he was sent to the galleys
grand reign grand century
under louis xv
children disappeared in paris the police carried them off for what mysterious purpose no one knew
barbier speaks ingenuously of these things
it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard when they ran short of children took those who had fathers
the fathers in despair attacked the exempts
in that case the parliament intervened and had someone hung
who
the exempts
not be fathers
chapter vii the gamin should have his place in the classifications of india the body of street arabs in paris almost done titutes a caste
one might almost say not everyone who wishes to belong to it can do so
this word gamin was printed for the first time and reached popular speech through the literary tongue in
it is in a little work entitled claude the us that this word made its appearance
the horror was lovely
the word passed into circulation
the elements which constitute the consideration of them a mins for each other are very various
we have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of notre dame another because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the dome of the invalides had been temporarily deposited and had p rugged some lead from them a third because he had seen a diligence tip over still another because he knew a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen
this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin a profound epiphone ha which the vulgar here laughs at without comprehending dieu de dieu
what ill luck i do have
to think that i have never yet seen anybody tumble from a fifth story window
surely this saying of a peasant is a fine one father so and so your wife has died of her malady why did you not send for the doctor
what would you have sir we poor folks die of ourselves
a man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the timbrel
the child of paris exclaims he is talking to his black cap

to be strong minded is an important item
to be present at executions constitutes a duty
he shows himself at the guillotine and he laughs
he calls it by all sorts of pet names the end of the soup the growler the mother in the blue the sky the last mouthful etc
etc
in order not to lose anything of the affair he scales the wall she hoists himself to balconies he ascends trees he suspends himself to grating she clings fast to chimneys
the gamin is born at opera she is born a mariner
a roof inspires him with no more fear than a hash
there is no festival which comes up to an execution on the place degree f
samson and the abbe montes are the truly popular names
they boot at the victim in order to encourage him
they sometimes admire him

in the brotherhood of famine a memorable accident counts for a great deal
the fish is no mediocre element of respect
one of the things that the gamin is findest of saying islam wine and string come now
to be left handed renders you very enviable
a squint is highly esteemed
nevertheless the police keep an eye on him and the result is a highly dramatic situation which once gave rise to a fraternal and memorable try that cry which was celebrated about is a strategic warning from gaming in a minor scans like a verse from homer with a notation as in expressible as the eleusis c chant of the pana the nasa and knit one encounters again the ancients vote
here it is one titlo here
sometimes this gnat that is what he calls himself knows how to read sometimes he knows how to write he always knows how to daub
he does not hesitate to acquire by no one knows what mysterious mutual instruction all the talents which can be of use to the public from home imitates the cry of the turkey from home scrawled pearson the walls
one summer evening when louis philippe was returning home on foot he saw a little fellow no higher than his knee perspiring and climbing up to draw a gigantic pear in charcoal on one of the pillars of the gate of neuilly the king with that good nature which came to him from henry iv
helped the gamin finished the peer and gave the child a louis saying the pearls of that also
the gamin lives uproar
a certain state of violence pleases him
he exec rates the cures
why are you doing that at the gate
a passerby asked
the boy replied there is a cure there
it was there in fact that the papal nuncio lived
nevertheless whatever may be the volta it ianism of the small gamin is the occasion to become a chorister presents itself it is quite possible that he will accept and in that case he serves the mass civilly
there are two things to which he plays tantalus and which he always desired without ever attaining them to overthrow the government and to get his trousers sewed up again
the gamin in his perfect state possesses all the policemen of paris and can always put the name to the face of any one which he chances to meet
he can tell them off on the tips of his fingers
he studied their habits and he has special notes on each one of them
he reads the souls of the police like an open book
he will tell you fluently and without flinching such an one is a traitor such another is very malicious such another is great such another is ridiculous
all these words traitor malicious great ridiculous have a particular meaning in his mouth
etc
chapter ix the old soul of gaul there was something of that boy un po quel in the son of the fish market beaumarchais had something of it
gamin erie is a shade of the gallic spirit
mingled with good sense it sometimes adds force to the latter as alcohol does to wine
sometimes it is a defect

champion net who treated miracles brutally rose from the pavements of paris he had when a small law inundated the porticos of saint jean de beauvais and of saint etienne dumont he had addressed the shrine of sainte genevieve familiarly to give orders to the phial of saint januarius
the gamin of paris is respectful ironical and insolent
he has villainous teeth because he is badly bed and his stomach suffers and handsome eyes because he has wit
if jehovah himself were present he would go hopping up the steps of paradise on one foot

as the horse of scripture says vat
and in a moment he has passed from the small best to the giant
this child of the puddle is also the child of the ideal
measure that spread of sings which reaches from moliere to barra
to sum up the whole and in one word the gamin is a being who amused himself because he is unhappy
chapter arc de paris ecce homo to sum it all up once more the parish a minor today like the grass ulus of some in days gone by js the infant populace with the wrinkle of the old world on his brow
the gamin is a grace to the nation and at the same time a diseases disease which must be cured how

chapter xi to scoff foreign there is no limit to paris
no city has had that domination which sometimes derives those whom it subjugates
to please go up athenians
exclaimed alexander
paris makes more than the law it makes the fashion paris sets more than the fashion it sets the routing
paris may be stupid if it sees fit it sometimes allows itself this luxury then the universe is stupid in company with it then paris awake aruba its eyes says how stupid i am
and bursts out laughing in the face of the human race
what a marvel is such a city
it is a strange thing that this grandiose news and this burlesque should be amicable neighbors that all this majesty should not be thrown into disorder by all this parody and that the same mouth can today blow into the trump of the judgment day and tomorrow into the reed flute
paris has a sovereign joviality
its rate this if the thunder and its farce holds a sceptre
its tempest sometimes proceeds from a grimace
its explosions or a day site masterpieces its prodigies its epics go forth to the bounds of the univer ce and so also do its cock and bull stories
its laugh is the mouth of a volcano which spatters the whole earth
it sheets are sparks
it imposes its caricatures as well as its ideal on people the highest monuments of human civilization accept its ironies and lend their eternity to its mischievous pranks
paris is always showing its teeth when it is not scolding it is laughing
such is paris
the smoke of its roots forms the ideas of the universe
a heap of mud and stone if you will but above all a moral being
it is more than great it is immense
why
because it is dating
to rate that is the price of progress
all sublime conquests are more or less the prizes of dating
in order that the revolution should take place it does not suffice that montesquieu should foresee it that diderot should preach in that beaumarchais should announce it that condorcet should calculate it that arouet should prepare it that rousseau should pre meditate if it is necessary that canton should dare it
the cry audacity
is a fiat lux
it is necessary for the sake of the forward march of the human race that there should be proud lessons of courage permanently on the heights

still he had a father and another
but his father did not think of him and his mother did not love him
he was one of those children most deserving of pity among all one of those who have father and mother and who are orphans nevertheless
this child never felt so well as when he was in the street
his parents had despatched him into life with a kick
he simply took flight
he was a boisterous pallid humble wide awake meeting law with a vivacious but sickly air
he went and came sang played at hopscotch scraped the gutters stole a little bit like cats and sparrows gayly laughed when he was called a rogue and got angry when called a thief
he had no shelter no bread no fire no love but he was merry because he was free
when these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them but so long as they are children they escape because of their smallness

precisely at that double number with which the reader is acquainted at the goffeau hovel
at that epoch the novel generally deserted and eternally decorated with the placard chambers to let chanced to be a rare thing inhabited by numerous individuals who however as is always the case in paris had no connection with each other
all belonged to that indigent class which begins to separate from the lowest of petty bourgeoisie in straitened circumstances and which extends from misery to misery into the lowest depths of society down to those two beings in whom all the material things of civilization end the sewer man who are dow up the mud and the day picker who collects scraps
i know not what philosopher has said old women are never lacking
this new old woman was named madame bourbon and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three park que te who had reigned in succession over her soul
the most miserable of those who inhabited the novel were a family of four persons consisting of father mother and two daughters already well grown all four of whom were lodged in the same attic one of the cells which we have already mentioned
at first sight this family presented no very special feature except its extreme destitution the father when he hired the chamber has stated that his name was jon dee the

he arrived there and found distress and what is still sadder no smiles food hearth and cold hearts
when he entered he was asked whence come you
he replied from the street
when he went away they asked him whither are you going
he replied into the streets
his mother said to him what did you come here for
this child lived in this absence of affection like the pale plants which spring up in cellars
it did not cause him suffering and he blamed no one
he did not know exactly how a father and mother should be
nevertheless his mother loved his sisters
we have forgotten to mention that on the boulevard du temple this child was called little gavroche
why was he called little gavroche
it seems to be the instinct of certain wretched families to break the thread

this silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared for those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the temple to which under louis xiv
the names of all the provinces of france were appended exactly as in our day the streets of the new tivoli quarter have received the names of all the capitals of europe a progression by the way in which progress is visible
m
gil lenormand who was as much alive as possible ibs as one of those men who had become curiosities to be viewed simply because they have lived a long time and who are strange because they formerly resembled everybody and now resemble nobody
he was a peculiar old man and in very truth a man of another and the real complete and rather haughty bourgeois of the eighteenth century who wore his good old bourgeoisie with the air with which marquises wear their matsui water
he was over ninety years of age his walk was erect he talked loudly saw clearly dragon estate slept and snored
he had all thirty two of his teeth
he only wore a pc charles when he read
he was of an amorous disposition but declared that for the last ten years he had wholly and decidedly renounced women
he could no longer please he said he did not add ism too old but i am too poor
he said if i were not ruined here
all he had left in fact was an income of about fifteen thousand francs
his dream was to come into an inheritance and to have a hundred thousand livres income for his drwsses
he did not be long as the reader will perceive to that puny variety of octigen aries who like i

chapter ii like master like house he lived in the marais rue des filles du calvaire no
he owned the house
this house has since been demolished and rebuilt and the number has probably been changed in those revolutions of numeration which the streets of paris undergo
he occupied an ancient and fast apartment on the first floor between street and gardens furnished to the very ceilings with great gobelins and beauvais tapestries representing pastoral scenes the subjects of the ceilings and the panels were repeated in miniature on the arm chairs
he enveloped moaned in a vast nine leaves screen of coromandel lacquer
long full curtain dying from the windows and formed great broken foods that were very magnificent
the garden situated immediately under his windows was attached to that one of them which formed the angle by means of a staircase twelve of fifteen step along which the old gentleman ascended and descended with great agility
in addition to a library adjoining his chamber he had a boudoir of which he thought a great deals gallant and elegant retreat with magnificent hangings of straw with a pattern of flowers and fleurs de lys made on the valleys of louis xiv

m
gil lenormand had inherited it from a grim maternal great aunt who had died a centenarian
he had had two wives
his manners were something between those of the courtier which he had never been and the lawyer which he might have been
he was gay and caressing when he had a mind
in his youth he had been one of those men who are always received by their wives and never by their mistresses because they are at the same time the most sullen of husbands and the most charming of lovers in existence
he was a connoisseur of painting
he had in his chamber a marvellous portrait of no one knows whom painted by jordaens executed with great dashes of the brush with millions of details in a confused and haphazard manner
m
nor yet that of louis xvi
it was that of the incroyable s of the directory
he had thought himself young up to that period and had followed the fashions
his coat was of lightweight cloth with voluminous refers along swallowtail and large steel buttons
with this he wore knee breeches and buckle shoes
he always thrust his hands into his fobs
he said authoritatively the french revolution is a heap of blackguards

he uttered coarse speeches obscenities and filth with a certain tranquillity and lack of astonishment which was elegant
it was in keeping with the unceremonious ness of his century
it is to be noted that the age of peri phrase in verse was the age of crudities in prose

on these occasions he hinted to people that he meant to live to be a hundred
chapter v basque and nicolette he had theories
here is one of them when a man is passionately fond of women and when he has himself a wife for whom he cares but little who is homely cross legitimate with plenty of rights perched on the code and jealous at need there is but one way of extricating himself from the quandry and of procuring peace and that is to let his wife control the purse strings
this abdication sets him free
then his wife busied herself grows passionately fond of handling coin gets her fingers covered with verdigris in the process undertakes the education of half share tenants and the training of farmers convoked lawyers presides over notaries harangues scrivener s visits limbs of the law follows lawsuits draws up leases dictates contracts feels herself the sovereign sells buys regulates promises and compromises funds fast and annuls yields concedes and retro cedes arrange a clear ranges boards lavishes she commits follies a supreme and personal delight and that consoles her

he had not hesitated on this point not being anxious to leave a property behind him
besides he had noticed that patri monies are subject to adventures and for instance become national property he had been present at the avatars of consolidated three percent sand he had no great faith in the great book of the public debt

this royal renown sometimes drew down upon him singular windfalls

this manner of procedure was good tempered
the woman whose name was harmon sent him another parcel in the following year
it was a boy again
thereupon m
gil lenormand capitulated
he sent the two beats back to their mother promising to pay eighty francs a month for their maintenance on the condition that the said mother would not do so any more
he added i insist upon it that the mother shall treat them well
i shall go to see them from time to time
and this he did

gil lenormand who was still young he was only seventy four lived in the faubourg saint germain the servando ni near saint sulpice
he had only retired to the marais when he quitted society long after attaining the age of eighty
and on abandoning society he had injured himself in his habits
the principal one and that which was in variable was to keep his door absolutely closed during the day and never to receive any one whatever except in the evening
that had been the fashion of his century and he would not swerved to hit
the day is vulgar said he and deserves only a closed shutter
fashionable people only light up their minds when the zenith lights up its stars
and he barricaded himself against everyone even had it been the king himself
this was the antiquated elegance of his day
chapter viii two do not make a pair we have just spoken of m
they had come into the world ten years apart
in their youth they had not be very little resemblance to each other either in character of countenance and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible
the youngest had a char high soul which turned towards all that belongs to the light was occupied with flowers with verses with music which fluttered away into glorious space enthusiastic ethereal and was wedded from her very you think deal to a vague and heroic figure
the elder had also her chimeras be expire in the azure some very wealthy purveyors contractors splendidly stupid husband a million made man or even a prefect the receptions of the prefecture an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck official balls the harangues of the town hall to be madame la prefers all this has created a whirlwind in her imagination
thus the two sisters strayed each in her own dream at the epoch when they were young girls
both had wings the one like an angel the other like a goose
no ambition is ever fully realized here below at least
no paradise becomes terrestrial in our day
the younger wedded the man of her dreams but she died
the elder did not marry a talk
at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are relating she was an antique virtue an incombustible pride with one of the sharpest noses and one of the most obtuse minds that it is possible to see
a characteristic detail outside of her immediate family noone has ever known her first name
she was called mademoiselle ville norm and the elder
in the matter of cant mademoiselle ville norm and could have given points to amiss
her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness
she cherished a frightful memory of her life one day a man had beheld her garter
she had only served to accentuate this pitiless modesty
her gui mpe was never sufficiently opaque and never ascended sufficiently high
she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking
the peculiarity of prudery is to place all the more sentinels in proportion as the fortress is the less menaced
nevertheless let him who can explain these antique mysteries of innocence she allowed an officer of the lancers her grandnephew named the odule to embrace her without displeasure
in spite of this favored lancer the label or use under which we have classes her suited her to absolute perfection
mademoiselle ville norm and was a sort of twilight soul
prudery is a semi virtue and are novice
to prudery she added bigotry a well as sorted lining
she belonged to the society of the virgin wore a white veil on certain festivals mumbled special prisons revered the holy blood generated the sacred heart remained for hours in contemplation before a rococo jesuit altar in a chapel which was inaccessible to the rank and file of the faithful and there allowed her soul to do as among little clouds of marble and through great days of gilded wood
she had a chapel friend an ancient virgin like herself naked mademoiselle day bois who was a positive blockhead and beside whom mademoiselle giloe norman chad the pleasure of being an eagle
beyond the agnus dei and ave maria mademoiselle day bois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves
mademoiselle gay boys perfect in her style was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence
let us say it plainly mademoiselle ville norm and had gained rather than lost as she grew older
this is the case with passive natures
she had never been malicious which is relative kindness and then years wear away the angles and the softening which comes with time had come to her
she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret
there breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished and which had never had a beginning
she kept house for her father
m
gil lenormand had his daughter near him as we have seen that monseigneur bienvenu had his sister with him
these households comprised of an old man and an old spinster are no tears and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support
there was also in this house between this elderly spinster and this old mans child a little boy who was always trembling and mute in the presence of m

madame de t
lived far from the court a very mixed society as she said in a noble isolation proud and poor
a few friends assembled twice a week about her widowed hearth and these constituted a purely royalist salon
they sipped feathers and uttered groans of cries of horror at the century the charter the final artists the prostitution of the blue ribbon of the jacobin is mpg louis xviii

that is the lamothe of the affair of the necklace
these singular amnesties do occur in parties
let us add the following in the bourgeoisie honored situations decay through too easy relations one must beware whom one admits in the same way that there is a loss of caloric in the vicinity of those who are cold there is a diminution of consideration in the approach of despised persons

his face was the same color as his trousers
this h

he had in spite of his levitt and without its interfering in any way with his dignity a certain manner about him which was imposing dignified honest and lofty in a bourgeois fashion and his great age added to it

the years finally produce around ahead a venerable dish evel ment
in addition to this he said things which had the genuine sparkle of the old rock

chapter ii one of the red spectres of that epoch anyone who had chanced to pass through the little town of vernon at this epoch and who had happened to walk across that fine monumental bridge which will soon be succeeded let us hope by some hideous iron cable bridge might have observed had he dropped his eyes over the parapet a man about fifty years of age wearing a leather cap and trousers and a waistcoat of coarse gray cloth to which something yellow which had been a red ribbon was seen show with wooden sabots tanned by the sun his face nearly black and his hair nearly write a large scar on his forehead which ran down upon his cheek howe event prematurely a few who walked nearly every day hoe and sickle in hand in one of those compartments surrounded by wells which a bit on the bridge and forced the left bank of the seine like a chain of terraces charming enclosures full of flowers of which one could say were they much larger these are gardens and were they a little smaller these are bouquets
all these enclosures abutilon the river at one end and on a house at the other
the man in the waistcoat and the wooden shoes of whom we have just spoken inhabited the smallest of these enclosures and the most humble of these houses about
he lived there alone and solitary silently and poorly with a woman who was neither young not old neither homely not pretty neither a peasant gprs bourgeoise who served him
the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there
these flowers were his occupation
by dint of labor of perseverance of attention and of buckets of water he had succeeded in creating after the creator and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature
he was ingenious he had forestalled soul anne bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heart mould for the cultivation of race and precious shrubs from america and china
he was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting boeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dew at the top of a spear of grace of which the sun made a carbuncle
his table was very plain and he drank more milk than wind
a child could make him give way and his servant scolded him
he was so timid that he seemed why he rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped a this page and his cure the abbe have if a good old man
nevertheless of the inhabitants of the town of strangers or any chance comers curious to see his tulips ranga this little cottage he opened his door with a smile
he was the brigand of the loire
anyone who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been struck by a game which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name of georges pont mercy
the revolution broke out
he was under joe beda that chienne sand at the battle of mib goal is sep where shall from a fiscal en broke his arm
then he passed to the frontier of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the colder ends with joubert
joubert was appointed its adjutant general and long mercy sub lieutenant
he beheld his old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted sabre he was shouting forward
the genoese commander wanted to throw his gagnon into the sea to hide the soldiers between decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel
pont mercy had the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates
twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pinnace and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea
in he was in that halter division which took ginsberg from the archduke ferdinand
at waiting en he received into his arms beneath a story of bullets colonel mallet it mortally wounded at the head of the th dragoons
when the cavalry of the imperial russian guard crushed a battalion of the th of the line pont mercy was one of those who took their revenge and overthrew the guard
the emperor gave him the cross
pont mercy saw wurmser at mantua melas and alexandria mack a film made prisoners in succession
he formed a part of the eighth corps of the grand army which mortier commanded and which captures hamburg
then he was transferred to the th of the line which was the old regiment of flanders
at eylau he was in the cemetery where for the space of two hours the heroic captain louis hugo the uncle of the author of this book sustained alone with his company of eighty three men every effort of the hostile army
pont mercy was one of the three who emerged a live from that cemetery
he was at friedland
then he saw moscow
then lab fees in a then lutsen bautzen dresden wachau leipzig and these files of helen heusen then month or all chateau thierry cra on the banks of the marne the banks of the au age and the redoubtable position of palm
star gay leduc being them a captain he put ten cossacks to the sword and saved not his general but his corporal
he was well slashed upon this occasion and twenty seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone
eight days before the capitulation of parks he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry
he had what was called under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude for handling the sabre of the musket as a soldier of a squadron of a battalion as an officer
it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both cavalrymen and infantry at one and the same time
he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba
it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion
he was covered with blood
while tearing down the banner he had received a sword cut across his face
the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer or the legion of honor
pour mercy replied sure i thank you for my widow
an hour later he fell in the ravine o domain
now who was this georges pont mercy
he was this same brigand of the loire
we have already seen something of his history
after waterloo pont mercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road o domain as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the cantonments of the loire
the restoration had placed him on half pay them had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon
king louis xviii
regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred days as not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grace of colonel nor his title of baron
he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pont mercy
he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it his rosette as an officer of the legion of honor
the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration
when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pont mercure fitted with a butter smile i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand
then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette
they dared not interfere with him
two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pont mercy
he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken
at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte
pont mercy has ended mayer be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor
one day he encountered the district attorney on one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said mr
crown attorney am i permitted to wear muscat
he had nothing save his meagre half pay as chief of squadron
he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon
he lived there alonewe have just seen how
under the empire between two wars he had found time to maddy mademoiselle ville normand
the old bourgeois thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sign saying the greatest families are forced into it
in madame long mercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child
moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up his chief not conspired
he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done
he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz
m
ville norm and kept up no relations with his son in law
the colonel was a bandit to him
m
guile norm and never mention ec the colonel except when he occasionally made mocking allusions to his baron shop
it had been expressly agreed that long mercy should never attempt to see his son nor to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited
for the filme norman dsp on the ecg was a man afflicted with the plague
they intended to bring up the child in their own way
perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to them thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself
the inheritance of father ville norm and did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle ville norm and the elder was considerable
the boy whose name was marine knew that he had a father but nothing more
no one opened his mouth to him about it
while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sky like a criminal breaking his bag and went and posted himself at saint sulpice at the hour when aug triple norman word mark is to the mass
there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless for daring to breathe he gazed at his child
the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster
from this has arisen his connection with the cure or vernon m
that worthy priest was the brother of a warden of saint sulpice who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes
that man who had womanly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden
that face had clung to his mind
one day having done to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pont mercy on the bridge and had recognised the man of saint sulpice
the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the fire and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other
this visit led to others
this caused the cure to regard him with generation and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure
and moreover when both are sincere and good nomen so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier
at bottom the man is the same
the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference
twice a year on the first of january an const
gil lenormand tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread
chapter iii require cart madame de t
it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life
this opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night than day came to him through this skylight
this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave
surrounded by all those singular and imposing personages he taxes about him with serious amazement
everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him
there were in madame set

this was at toulon
their business was to go at night and gather up on the scaffold the heads and bodies of the persons who had been guillotined during the day they bore away on their backs these dripping corpses and their rev valley slave blouses hadac lot of blood at the back of the neck which was dry in the morning and set at night
these tragic tales abounded in madame de t

the cardinal of xlh was a merry little man who displayed his red stockings beneath his fucked up cassock his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who at that epoch passed through the rue mon summer evenings where the hotel dec it then stood halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his sons lavish monseigneur co first bishop in partibus of carts remark abbe i make a cannon

all these ecclesiastics thought of the most part as much courtiers as churchmen added to the gravity of the t
salina hoses sign up rial aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vin the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte damn and the duc de val
this duc de val although prince demon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of france and its peerage that he viewed everything through their medium
it was he who said the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france of england
moreover as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois
m
ville form and reigned there
the relay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society
there reputation seven royalist reputations were held in quarantine
there is always a trace of anarchy in renown
chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pere duchene
some of these offer at did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance
comte be it was received there subject to correction
the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons
the faubourg saint germain reeks of the fa not even now
the royalists of today are demagogues let us record it to their credit
at madame de t
manner et be readmitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive
some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric
persons but superficially acquainted dumb them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique
a woman was called madame la generale
madame la colonel it was not entirely disused
the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesse see longueville and we chevreuse preferred this appellation to her title of princesse
the marquise de crew it was also called madame la colonel le
it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper
men and deeds were brought to judgment there
they needed at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it
they abetted each other in amazement
they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed
methuselah bestowed information on spine nodes
the deaf man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things
they declared that the time which have kasper since coblentz had not existed
in the same manner that louis xviii
was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were fy rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence
all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus
there were some young people but they were rather dead
the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated
these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp
they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre
nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserved conservation conservateur to be in good odor that was the point
there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it
it was a mummified society
the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw
a worthy old marquise and mittee and ruined who had but a solitary make continued to say my people
what did they do on madame de t
they were ultra
to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day
let us explain it
to be ultra is to go beyond
it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the attar it is to ill treat the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to cavil at the favor on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papist that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against
the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration
nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of j
deville is the practical man of the right
these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the past
there existed in that light and that shadows complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing its eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with ill temper and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquises by the street ful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but wept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdaining the companions of napoleon
the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty it on the sword of marengo was odious and was only a sabre
former days did not recognize yesterday
people no longer had the feeling for what was grand
there was someone who called bonaparte scapin
this society no longer exists
nothing of it we repeat exists today
when we select from it someone figure at random and attempt to make it live again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge
it is because it too as a matter of fact has been engulfed in a deluge
it has disappeared beneath two revolutions
what billows are ideas
how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful rules
such was the physiognomy of the salons of those distant and candid times when m
mar rainville harm or edit than voltaire
these salons had a literature and politics of their own
they believed info ever
m
a gift laid down the law in them
they comments term
colney the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malasia is
napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre
later on the introduction into history of m
these salons did not long preserve their purity
beginning with doctrina flags began to spring upon them a disturbing shade
their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so
where the ultras were very proud the distri mariana were rather ashamed
they have if they had silence their political donna was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded
they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neck ties and tightly buttoned coats
the mistake of the misfortune of the doctrina rian party was to create aged youth
they assumed the poses of wise men
they dreamed of eng rafting a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle
they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolished
they were heard to say thanks for royal i am
it has rendered more than one service
it has brought back tradition worship religion respect
it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted
it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeur s of the monarchy with the new grandeur s of the nation
its mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generations the age
but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we got sometimes been guilty of it towards them
the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points
to attack royal is misamis construction of liberalism
what an error
and what blindness
revolutionary france is wanting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself
after theft of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the thos july
they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the fleur de lys
it seems that we must always have something to proscribe
does it serve any purpose to unfold the crown of louis xiv
to scrape the cost of arms of henry iv
we scoff at m
what was it that he did
what are we doing
boy vines belongs to us as well as marengo
that is our patrimony
to what purpose shall we diminish it
we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present
why not accept the whole of history
why not live the whole of france
it is thus that doctrina diane criticised and protected royal i am which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection
the ultra a marked the first epoch of royal i am congregation characterized the second
skill follows arrow
let us confine ourselves here to this sketch
in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown today
but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea
souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past
moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own
one may smile at it but one can neither despise not hate it
it was the france of former days
marius pont mercy pursued some studies as all children do
when he emerged from the hands of aunt ville norm and his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence
this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant
marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school
he was a royalist fanatical and severe
he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic law dignified to harshness puerto shyness
the old man bade farewell to the faubourg saint germain and to madame edt
there he had for servants in addition to the porter that chambermaid nicolette who had succeeded to magnon and that short bed at her and purdy basque who have been mentioned above
in marius had just attained his seventeenth year
one evening on his return home he saw his grand father holding a letter in his hand
marius said m
gil lenormand you will set out for vernon tomorrow
why
said marius
to see your father
marius was seized with a trembling fit
he had thought of everything except this that he should one day be called upon to see his father
nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit it more disagreeable to him
it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation
it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty
marius in addition to his motives of political antipathy was convinced that his father the slasher asm
guild norm and called him on his amiable days did not love him this was evident since he had abandoned him to others
feeling that he was not be loved he did not love
nothing is more simple he said to himself
he was so astounded that he did not question m
ville normand
the grandfather resumed it appears that he is ill
he demands your presence
and after a pause he added set out tomorrow morning
take it
he says that here is haste
then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket
marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning
a diligence from the rue du boyko i took the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon
neither marius norm
ville norm and thought of making inquiries about it
the next day at twilight marius reached vernon
people were just beginning to light their candles
he asked the first person whom he met form
the house was pointed out to him
he rang a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door
m
pont mercy
said marius
the women remained motionless
is this his house
demanded marius
the woman nodded affirmatively
can i speak with him
the woman shook her head
but i am his son
persisted marius
he is expecting me
he no longer expects you said the woman
then he perceived that she was weeping
she pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor he entered
in that room which was lighted by shallow candle standing on the chimney piece there were three men one standing erect another kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt
the one on the floor was the colonel
the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in prayer
the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously
as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he had written tom
gillen on hand to demand his son
the malady had grown worse
i shall go to meet him
then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber
he had just expired
the doctor had been summoned and the cure
the doctor had arrived too late
the son had also arrived too late
the eye was extinguished but the year was not yet dry
marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that venerable and manly face on those open eyes which was not on those white locks those robust limbs in which here and there brown lines markings word thrusts and a sort of red stars which indicated bullet holes were visible
he contemplated that gigantic seat which stamped heroism in that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness
he reflected that this man was his father and that this man was dead and a chill ran over him
the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chances to behold stretched out in death
anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber
the servant woman was lamenting in a corner the cute was praying and his sons were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping
the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word he was the stranger there
marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude he held his hat in his hand and he dropped it on the floor in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it
at the same time he experienced remorse and her exposed himself for behaving in this manner
but was it his fault
he did not love his father
why should be
the colonel had left nothing
the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial
the servant found a scrap of paper which she handed to marius
the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo
since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it
that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course
below the colonel had added at that same battle of waterloo a sergeant saved my life
i think that he has recently been keeping a little in mind village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles lemont vermeil
if my son meets him he will do all the good he can to thenardier
marius took this paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man
nothing remained of the colonel
m
top lenormand had his sword and uniform sold to an old clothes dealer
the neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers
the other plants turned to nettles and weeds and died
marius remained only forty eight hours at vernon
after the interment he returned to paris and applied himself again to his law studies with no more thought of his father than is the latter had never lived
in two days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten
marius words rape on his hat
that was all
chapter v the utility of going to mass in order to become a revolutionist marius had preserved the religious habits of his childhood
one sunday when he went to hear mass at saint sulpice at that same chapel of the virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small large placed himself behind a pillar being more absent minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion and knelt down with lid paying any special need upon a chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name monsieur have it warden
mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to marius this is my places or
marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his chair
the mass concluded marius at jpl stood thoughtfully a few paces distant the old man approached him again and said i beg your pardon sir for having disturbed you awhile ago and for again disturbing you at this moment you must have thought he intrusive and i will explain myself
there is no need of that sir said marius
yes
went on the old man i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me
you see i am attached to this place
it seems to me that the mass is better from here
why
i will tell you
it is from this place that i have watched a poor brave rather come regularly every two or three months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family arrangements
he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass
the little one never suspected that his father was there
perhaps he did not even know that he had weather poor innocent
the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen
he gazed at his child and he wept
he adored that little fellow poorman
i could see that
this spot has become sanctified in my sight and i have contracted a habit of coming hitherto listen to the mass
i prefer it to the stall to which i have a right in my capacity of warden
i knew that unhappy gentleman a little too
he sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy someday
he was separated from him because of political opinions
certainly i approve of political opinions but there are people who do not know where to stop
mon dieu
a man is not a monster because he was at ways flop a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that
he is dead i believe
he lived at vernon where i have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pont marie le mont percy
he had a fine sword but on my honor
pont mercy suggested marius turning pale
precisely pont mercy
did you know him
sir said marius he was my father
the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed am
you are the child
well
poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly
marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings
on the following day he said tim
ville norm and i have arranged a hunting party with some friends
will you permit me to be absent for three days
four
replied his grandfather
go and amuse yourself
and he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love affair
chapter vi the consequences of having met a warden where it was that marius went will be disclosed a little further on
marius was absent for three days then he returned to paris went straight to the library of the law school and asked for the files of the moniteur
he read the moniteur he read all the histories of the republic and the empire the memorial de sainte helene all the memoirs all the newspapers the bulletins the proclamation she devoured everything
he went to see the generals under whom georges pont mercy had served among others conteh
marius came to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species of lion lamb who had been his father
in the meanwhile occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thought she hardly saw the gillen or hands at all
he made his appearance at meals then they searched for him and he was not to be found
father ville norm and smiled
bah
bah
he is much of the age for the girls
sometimes the old man added the fence
i thought it was only an affair of gallantry it seems that it is an affair of passion
it was a passion in fact
marius was on the high road to adoring his father
at the same time his ideas underwent an extraordinary change
the phases of this change were numerous and successive
as this is the history of many kinds of our day we think it will prove useful to follow these phases stepbystep and to indicate the mall
that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him
the first effect was to dazzle him
up to that time the republic the empire had been to him only monstrous words
the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire a sword in the night
he had just taken a look at it and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows he had be held with a sort of unprecedented surprise mingled with fear and joy stars sparkling mirabeau very n lake saint just robespierre camille des moulins wanton and a sun arose napoleon
he did not know where he stood
here coiled blinded by the brilliant lights
he asserted in his conscience that all this has been good
what his dazzled state neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation we do not think it necessary to point out here
it is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording
progress is not accomplished in one stage
that stated once for all in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow we continue
he then perceived that up to that moment he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father
he had not know neither the one of the other and a sort of voluntary night has obscured his eyes
now he saw and on the one hand he admired while on the other head prev
he was filled with regret and remorse and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb
oh
if his father had still been in existence if he had still had him if god in his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated him self how he would have cried to his father father
here i am
it is i
i have the same heart as thou
i am thy son
how he would have embraced that whitehead bathed his hair in tears gazed upon his scar pressed his hands scored his garment kissed his feet
oh
why had his father died so early before his time before the justice the love of his son had come to him
marius had a continual son in his heart which said to him every moment alas
at the same time he became more truly serious note truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith
at each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason
an inward growth seemed to be in progress within him
he was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to him his father and his country
as everything opens when one has a key so he explained to himself that which he had hated be penetrated that which he had abhorred henceforth be plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detect and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse
when he reflected in his former opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seemed to him already so very ancient hebrew indignant yet he smiled
from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of napoleon
but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor
from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgments of the party of on bonaparte
now all the prejudices of the restoration all its interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon
it exec rated him even more than it did robespierre
it had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of mothers
bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people which as we lately pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo
thus in speaking of bonaparte one was free to do not to puff up with laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom
marius had never entertained about that man as he was called any other ideas in his mind
they had combined with the tenacity which existed in his nature
there was in him a headstrong little man who hated napoleon
on reading history on studying him especially in the documents and materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes of markus was gradually rent
he caught a glimpse of something immense and he suspected that he had been received up to that moment on the score of bonaparte as about all the rest each day he saw more distinctly and he set about moon tung slowly stepbystep almost regretfully in the beginning then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps then the vaguely illuminates steps at last the luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm
one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof
his candle was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window
all sorts of reveries reached him from space and mingled with his thoughts
what a spectacle is the night
one hears full sounds without knowing whence they proceed one beholds jupiter which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand the azureus black the stars shine it is formidable
his heart contracted within him
he was in a transport trembling panting
all at once without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window gaz de intently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the eternal immensity and exclaimed long live the emperor
from that moment fort hall was over the ogre of corsica the usurper the tyrant the monster who was the power of his own sisters the actor who took lessons of talma the poisoned of jaffa the tiger buonaparte all this vanished and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar
he was the predestined constructor of the french group succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe
he was a prodigious architect of a destruction the continuer of charlemagne of louis xi
of henry iv
of richelieu of louis xiv
and of the committee of public safety having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots powerful in his crime
he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the great nation
he was better than that he was the very incarnation of france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world by the light which he shed
marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise up on the frontier and which will guard the future
despot but dictator a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution
napoleon became for him the man people as jesus christ is the many of
it will be perceived that like all new converts to a religion his conversion intoxicated him he buried himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far
his nature was so constructed once on the downward slope it was almost impossible for him to put on the fray
fanaticism for the sword took possession of him and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea
he did not perceive that along with genius and pell hell he was admitting force that is to say that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry on the one hand that which is divine on the other that which is brutal
in many respects he had set about receiving himself otherwise
he admitted everything
he had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the pump
in the new path which he had entered in in judging the mistakes of the old regime as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating circumstances
at all events a tremendous step had been taken
where he had formerly be held the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france
his orientation has changed
what had been his east became the west
he had turned squarely round
all these revolutions were accomplished within him without his family obtaining an inkling of the case
when during this mysterious labor he had entirely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the jacobite and the royalist when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist profoundly democratic and republican he went to an engraved on the quai des lefevres and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name lebaron marius pont mercy
this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him a change in which everything gravitated round his father
only as he did not know anyone and could not sow his cards with any porter he put them in his kicks t
we have long ago said that m
there already existed between them all the dissonances of the brave young man and the frivolous old man
the gayety offer inte shocks and exasperated the melancholy of werther
so long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both marius had me to
gil lenormand the reasons bridge
when the bridge fell an abyss was formed
and then over and above all marius experienced unutterable impulses to revolt when he reflected that it was n
gillen of hand who had from stupid motives torn him ruthlessly from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child of the father
by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at a version for his grandfather
nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have already said
only hebrew colder and solder laconic at meals and rare in the house
when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and alleged his studies his lectures the examination sets
as a pretext
his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis inlive
i know all about it
from time to time marius absentee himself
where is it that he goes off like this
said his aunt
on one of these trips which were always very brief he went to mont vermeil in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the innkeeper thenardier
thenardier had failed the inn was closed and no one knew what had become of him
marius was away from the house for four days on this quest
he is getting decidedly wild said his grandfather
they thought they had noticed that he wore something on his breast under his shirt which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon
chapter vii some petticoat we have mentioned a lancer
he was a great grandnephew of m
gil lenormand on the layer gals ice who led a garrison life outside the family and far from the domestic hearth
lieutenant theo ruleville norm and fulfilled all the conditio be required to make what is called a fine officer
he visited paris very rarely and so rarely that markus had never seen him
the cousins knew each other only by name
we think we have said that the odule was the favorite of aunt ville norm and who preferred him because she did not see him
not seeing people permits one to attribute to them all possible perfections
one morning mademoiselle ville norm and the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her placidity was capable of allowing
go
ville norman chad added in an aside as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead here he is passing the night out again
mademoiselle giloe norm and had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled and on the staircase had dropped this exclamation this is too much
and this interrogation but where is it that he goes
she espied some adventure of the heart more or less illicit a woman in the shadows rendezvous a mystery and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair
testing a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal sainted could do not detect this
there is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartment for bigotry
so she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history
in order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her songs he took refuge in her talents and set about scalloping with one layer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the empire and the restoration in which there are numerous cartwheels
the work was clumsy the worker cross
she had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened
mademoiselle ville norm and raised her nose
lieutenant the odule stood before her making the regulation salute
she uttered a cry of delight
you here the odule
she exclaimed
on my way through town aunt
embrace me
here goes
said the ovule
and he kissed her
aunt ville norm and went to her writing desk and opened it
you will remain with us a week at least
i leave this very evening sun r
it is not possible
mathematically
remain my little the odule i beseech you
they are changing our garrison we have been at me pun we are being transferred to gaillon
it is necessary to pass through paris in order to get from the old post to the new one
and she put ten louis into his hand
for my pleasure you mean to say my dear aunt
the odule kissed her again and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratched from her neck by the braiding song is uniform
are you making the journey on horseback with your regiment
she asked him
no aunt
i wanted to see you
i have special permission
my servant is taking my horse i am travelling by diligence
and by the way i want to ask you something
what is it
is my cousin marius pont mercy travelling so too
how do you know that
said his aunt suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity
on my arrival i went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe
well
a traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial
i saw his name on the card
what name
marius pont mercy
the wicked fellow
exclaimed his aunt
ag
your cousin is not a steady las like yourself
to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence
just as i am going to do
but you it is your city in his case it is wildness
body
said the odule
here an event occurred to mademoiselle ville norm and the elder an idea struck her
if she had been a man she would have slapped her brow
and a post room ized the ovule are you aware whether your cousin knows you
no
i have seen him but he has never deigned to notice me
so you are going to travel together
he in the imperiali in the coupe
where does this diligence run
to an delta
then that is where marius is going
unless like myself he should stop on the way
i get down at vernon in order to take the branch coach for gaillon
marius
what an ugly name
what possessed them to make him marius
while you at least are called the odule
i would rather be called alfred said the officer
listen the odule
i am listening aunt
pay attention
i am paying attention
you understand
yes
well marius absents himself
eh
eh
he travels
ah
ah
he spends the night out
oh
oh
we should like to know what there is behind all this
the odule replied with the composure of a man of bronze some petticoat or other
and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added a lass
that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m
ville norm and speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word gillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the granduncle and the grandnephew
she resumed do is a favor
follow marius a little
he does not know you it will be easy
since a laws there is try to get a sight of her
you must write us the tale
it will amuse his grandfather
the odule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel
he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt
and he added in an aside to himself here i am a duenna
mademoiselle ville norm and embraced him
you are not the man to play such pranks the odule
you obey discipline you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature
the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity
marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watches
as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep
his slumber was complete and conscientious
argos snored all night long
at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted vernon
delay of vernon
travellers for vernon
and lieutenant the odule some
gold he growled still half asleep this is where i get out
then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius
this set him to laughing
perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as here buttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform
he may have stopped at poissy he may have stopped at friel if he did not get out at meylan he may have got out at nantes unless he got out at dolls house or if he did not go on as far as pact with the choice of turning to the left age creusot to the right at la roche guy on
run after him aunty
what the devil ami to write to that good old soul
at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial made its appearance at the window of the coupe
cat that he marius
said the lieutenant
it was marius
a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilion say the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers
give your ladies flowers
she cried
marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket
come now said theory of leaping down from the coupe this piqued my curiosity
who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to
she must be a splendidly handsome woman for so find a bouquet
i want to see her
and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius
marius paid no attenti onto the odule
elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at them
he seemed to see nothing around him
he is pretty deeply in love
thought the odule
marius directed his steps towards the church
capital said the odule to himself
rendezvous seasoned with a bit of massage the best sort
on arriving at the church markus did not enter it but skirted the apse
he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse
the rendezvous is appointed outside said the odule
and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned
on arriving there he halted in amazement
marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on a grave
he had screen his bouquet there
at the extremity of the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron pont mercy
the laws was a grave
chapter viii marble against granite it was higher that marius had come on the first occasion of his absenting himself from paris
it was higher that he had come every time that m
gil lenormand had said he is sleeping out
lieutenant the odule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and six agreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the colonel
he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and there was discipline in this retreat
death appeared to him with large epaulets and he almost made the military salute to him
not know inn what to write to his aunt he decided not to write a tall and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by the odule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate countershock at paris
m
giloe norm and who had risen be times like all old men in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find out where he has been
but the youth had taken less time to descend that the old man had to ascend and when father ville norm and entered the attic marius was no longer there
the bed has not been disturbed and in the new layout spread but not defiantly the great coat and the black ribbon
i like this better said m
ville normand
and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where mademoiselle ville norm and was already seated busily embroidering her cartwheels
the entrance was a triumphant one
m
gillen or hand held in one hand the great coat and in the other the neck ribbon and exclaimed victory
we are about to penetrate the mystery
we are going to learn the most minute details we are going to la your finger on the debauched ie do to italy friend
here we have the romance itself
i have the portrait
in fact a case of black sha green resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon
the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor hungry fellow he holds an admirable dinner which is not for him pass under his very nice
for this evidently is a portrait
i know all about such things
that is worn tenderly on the heart
how stupid they are
some abominable bright that will make us shudder probably
young men have such bad taste nowadays
let us see father said the old spinster
the case opened by the pressure of a spring
they found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper
from the same to the same said m
ville norm and bursting with laughter
i know what it is
a bullet doux
ah
let us read it
said the ain t
and she put on her spectacles
they unfolded the paper and read as follows for my son
the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo
since the restoration dispute any right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it
that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course
the feelings of father and daughter can not be described
they did not exchange a word
only m
the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case
at the same moment a little oblong packet enveloped in blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the great coat
mademoiselle gillen or hand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper
she handed one of them tom
gil lenormand who read lebaron marius pont mercy
the old man rang the bell
nicole the same
m
gillen oem and took the ribbon the case and the cost flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room and said carry those suvs away
a full hour passed in the most profound silence
the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to eachother and were thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability
at the expiration of this hours in triple norm and said a pretty state of things
a few moments later marius made his appearance
he entered
even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing well
well
well
well
well
so you are a baron now
i present you my compliments
what is the meaning of this
marius red renew slightly and replied it means that i am the son of my father
m
gil lenormand ceased to laugh and said harshly i am your father
my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath grapeshot and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath gain at night who captured two flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love too find out doing rates his country and myself
this was more than m
ville normans could hear to hear
at the word republic he rise or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet
every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand
from a full tue he had turned red from red purple and from purple flame colored
marius
he cried
abominable child
i do not know what your father was
i do not wish to know
i know nothing about that and i do not know him
but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men
they were all rascals assassin drew caps thieves
i say all
i say all
i know not one
i say all
do you hear me marius
see here you are no more sharon than my slipper is
they were all bandits in the service of robespierre
all who served buonaparte were brigands
they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their legitimate king
all cowards who fled before the prussians and the english at waterloo
that is what i do know
whether monsieur your father comes in that category i do not know
i am sorry for it so much the worse your humble servant
in his turn it was marius who was the fire brand and m
gil lenormand who was the bellows
marius shivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire
he was the priest who he holds all his sacred waters cast to the winds the fakir who he holds a passerby so it upon his idol
it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence
what was metodo
his father had just been trampled underfoot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom
by his grandfather
how waste to avenge the one without outraging the other
it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father in avenged
in the one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks
he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised his eyes based fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder down with the bourbons and that great bogota louis xviii
louis xviii
had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him
the old man who had been crimson turned whiter than his hair
he wheeled round towards any storm
le duc de berry which stood on the chimney piece and made a profound box with a sort of peculiar majesty
then he paced twice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor cream as though he had been a stone statue walking
on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calma baron like this gentleman and a bourgeois like myself can not remain under the same roof
and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath be extended his arm towards marine and shouted to him be off
markus left the house
on the following day m
gil lenormand said to his daughter you will send sixty pistoles every six months to that blood drinker and you will never mention his name to me
having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months
marius on his side had gone forth in indignation
there was one circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation
there are always petty fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas
they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality the wrongs are not increased by them
neither paper nor case could afterwards be found
he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost
but the paper the writing that sacred relic all that was his very heart
what had been done with it
marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and without knowing where with thirty france his watch and a few clothes in a handbag
he had entered a hackney coach had engaged it by the hour and had directed his course at haphazard towards the latin quarter
what was to become of marius
book fourth
the friends of the abc chapter ix group which barely missed becoming historic at that epoch which was to all appearances in different a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current
youth was on the point may the reader pardon is the word of moulting
people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age
the needle which move around the compass also moves in souls
each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take
the royalists were becoming liberals liberals were turning democrats
it was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of eggs is to create intermixture whence the combination of very singular ideas people adored both napoleon and liberty
we are making history here
these were the mirages of that period
opinions traverse phases
do it airman royal i am a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bonapartist liberalism
other groups of minds were more serious
in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right
they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space
there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams
and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future
utopia today flesh and blood tomorrow
these advanced opinions had a double foundation
a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and underhand
a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree
the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine
there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations like the german tugend fund and italian carbon a risk but here and there there were dark undermining s which were in process of throwing offshoots
the cpu gourde was being outline data is there existed at paris among other affiliations of that nature the society of the friends of the abc
what were these friends of the abc
a society which had for its object apparently the education of children in reality the elevation of man
they declared themselves the friends of the abc the aba i see the debased that is to say the people
they wished to elevate the people
it was spun which we should go wrong to smile at
pins are sometimes serious factors in politics witness the ca stratus add astra which made a general of the army of garces witness barbarie t barberini witness the sperry set super handle team etc
etc
the friends of the abc were not numerous it was a secret society in the state of embryo we might almost say a coterie of coterie sensed in heroes
they assembled in paris in two localities near the fish market in a wine shop called for in their which more will be heard later on and near the pantheon in a little cafe in the rue saint michel called the cafe husain now torn down the first of these meeting places was close to the working man the second to the students
the assemblies of the friends of the abc were usually held in a backroom of the cafe husain
this hall which was tolerably remote from the cafe with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little rue des free
there they smoked and drank and gambler and laughed
there they conferred in very loud tones about everything and in whispers of other things
an old map of france under the republic was nailed to the walls sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent
the greater part of the friends of the abc were students who were on cordial terms with the working classes
here are the names of the principal ones
they belong in a certain measure to history enjolras combe ferre jean proud wire be jolly courts yes cba to tell eagle or lait lejoly grant aire
these young man formed a sort of family through the bond of friendship
all with the exception of laible were from the south
illustration friends of the abc band friends this was a remarkable group
it vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us
at the point of this drama which we have now reached it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a day of light upon these youthful heads before the reader he holds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure
enjolras whose name we have mentioned first of all the reader shall see why later on was an only son and wealthy
enjolras was a charming young man who was capable of being terrible
he was an helically handsome
he was a savage antinous
one would have said to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance that he had already in some previous state of existence traversed the revolutionary apocalypse
he possessed the tradition of it as though he has been a witness
he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair
a pontifical and warlike nature a singular thing in a youth
he was an officiating priest and a man of war from the immediate point of view a soldier of the democracy above the contemporary movement the priest of the ideal
his eyes were deep his lies a little red his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful his brow was lofty
a great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view
like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last who became illustrious at an early age he was endowed with excessive your hand was as rosy as a young girl although subject to hours of pallor
already a man he still seemed a child
his two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen he was serious it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman
he had but one passion the right buy one thought to overthrow the obstacle
on mount aventine he would have been gracchus in the convention he would have been saint just
he hardly saw the rose she ignored spring he did not hear the carolling of the birds the bare throat of evadne would have moved him no more than it would have moved aristote it on me like harm or just bought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword
he was severe in his enjoyments
he chastely dropped his eyes before everything which was not the republic
he was the marble lover of liberty
his speech was harshly inspired and had the thrill of a hymn
he was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul
woe to the love affair which should have risked itself beside him
by the side of enjolras who represented the logic of the revolution combed were represented its philosophy
between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference that its logic may end in war whereas its philosophy can end only in peace
bomber were complemented and rectified enjolras
he was less lofty but broader
he desired to pour into all kinds the extensive principles of general idea she said revolution but civilization and around the mountain peak he opened out a vast view of the blue sky
the revolution was more adapted for breathing with combed etre than with enjolras
enjolras expressed its divine right and con be ferre its natural right
the first attached himself to robespierre the second confined himself to condorcet
com never relives the life of all the rest of the world more than did enjolras
if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history the one would have been the just the other the wiseman
enjolras was the more virile comber were the more humane
homo and for that was the exact effect of their different shades
com be ferre was as gentle as enjolras was severe through natural whiteness
he loved the word citizen but he preferred the word man
he would gladly have said hombre like the spanish
he read everything went to the theatres attended the courses of public lecturers learned the polarization of light from arago grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which geoffrey sainte hilaire explained the double function of the external carotid artery and the internal the one which makes the face and the one which makes the brain he kept up with what was going on followed science stepbystep compared saint simon with fourier deciphered hieroglyphics broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology drew from memory a silkworm moth pointed out the faulty french in the dictionary of the academy studied put segur and deleuze affirmed nothing not even miracles denied nothing not even ghosts turned over the files of the moniteur reflected
he declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster and busied himself with educational questions
he desires that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level at cloning science at putting ideas into circulation at increasing the mind in youthful persons and he feared lest the present poverty of method the papyri news from a lot draft point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our colleges into art is usual oyster beds
he was learned a purist exact a graduate of the pooh technica close student and at the same time thoughtful even to chimaeras do his friends said
he believed in all dreams railroads the suppression of suffering in chirurgical operations the fixing of images in the dark chamber the electric telegraph the steering or balloons
moreover he was not much alarmed by the citadel detected against the human mind in every direction by superstition despotism and prejudice
he was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position
enjolras was a chief combe ferre was a guide
one would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other
it is not that combe ferre was not capable of fighting he did not refuse a hand to hand combat with the obstacle and to attack it by main force and explosively but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually by means of education the inculcation of axioms the promulgation of positive laws and between two oughta his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration
a conflagration can create an aurora no doubt but why not await the dawn
a volcano illuminates but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination
possibly combe ferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime
a light troubled by smoke progress purchased at the expense of violence only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit
in short be desired neither h author haste
while his tumultuous friends captivated by the absolute adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures combe ferre was inclined to let progress good progress take its own course he may have been cold but he was pure methodical but irreproachable phlegmatic but imperturbable
com be ferre would have knelt and clasped his hands to enable the future to arrive in all its candor and that nothing might disturb the immense and virtuous evolution of the races
the good must be innocent he repeated incessantly
and in fact of the grandeur of the revolution consists in keeping the dazzling ideal fixedly in view and of soaring thither athwart the lightnings with fire and blood in its talons the beauty of progress lies in being spotless and there exists between washington who represents the one and wanton who incarnates the other that difference which separates the swan from the angel with the songs of an eagle
jean proud site was a still softer shade than com de terre
his name was jehan owing to that petty momentary freak which mingled with the powerful and profound movement whence sprang the very essential study of the middle aged
jean proud site was in love be cultivated a lot of flowers played on the flute made verses loved the people pitied woman wept over the child confounded god and the future in the same confidence and blamed the revolution for having caused the fall of a royal hear that of andre chenier
his voice was ordinarily delicate but suddenly grew manly
he was learned even to erudition and almost an orientalist
above all he was good and a very simple thing to those who know how nearly goodness borders on grandeur in the matter of poetry he preferred the immense
he knew italian latin greek and hebrew and these served him only for the perusal of four ports dante juvenal aeschylus and isaiah
he loved to swinger through fields of wild oats and cornflowers and busied himself with clouds nearly as much as with events
his mind had two attitudes one on the side towards man the other on that towards god he studied or he contemplated
all day long he buried himself in social questions salary capital credit marriage religion liberty of thought education penal servitude poverty association property production and sharing the enigma of this lower world which covers the human anthill with darkness and at night he gazed upon the planets those enormous beings
like enjolras he was wealthy and am only son
he spoke softly bowed his head lowered his eyes smiled with embarrassment dressed badly had an awkward air blushed at a mere nothing and was very timid
yet he was intrepid
re holly was a working man scanmaker orphaned both of father and mother who earned with difficulty three francs a day and had but one thought to deliver the world
he had one other preoccupation to educate himself he called this also delivering himself
he had taught himself to read and write everything that he knew he had learned by himself
re hilly had a generous heart
the range of his embrace was immense
this orphan had adopted the peoples
as his mother had failed him he meditated on his country
he brooded with the profound divination of the man of the people over what we now call the idea of the nationality had learned history with the express object of raging with full knowledge of the case
in this club of young utopians occupied chiefly with france be represented the outside world
he had for his specialty greece poland hungary roumania italy
he uttered these names incessantly appropriately and inappropriately with the tenacity of right
the violations of turkey in greece and thessaly of russia in warsaw of austria in venice a tragedy in
above all things the great violence of a roused him
there is no more sovereign eloquence than the true in indignation he was eloquent with that eloquence
he was inexhaustible on that infamous date of on the subject of that noble and valiant race suppressed by treason and that three sided crimson that monstrous ambush the prototype and pattern of all those horrible suppressions of states which since that time have struck many a noble nation and have annulled their certificate of birth so to speak
all contemporary social crimes have their origin in the partition of poland
the partition of poland is a theorem of which all present political outrages are the corollaries
there has not been a despot not a traitor for nearly a century back who has not signed approved countersigned and copied nev ari at ur the partition of poland
when the record of modern treasons was examined that was the first thing which made its appearance
the congress of vienna consulted that crime before consummating its own
sounded the onset was the death of the game
this poor working man has constituted himself the tutor of justice and she recompensed him by rendering him great
the fact is that there is eternity in right
warsaw can no more be tartar than venice can be teuton
kings lose their pains and their honor in the attempt to make them so
sooner or later the submerged part floats to the surface and reappears
greece becomes greece again italy is once more italy
the protest of fight against the deed persists forever
the theft of a nation can not be allowed by prescription
these potty deeds of rascality have no future
a nation can not have its mark extracted like a pocket handkerchief
source trac had a father who was called m
de source trac
one of the false ideas of the bourgeoisie under the restoration as regards aristocracy and the nobility was to believe in the particle
the particle as everyone knows possessed no significance
but the bourgeois of the epoch of la minerve estimated so highly that poor de that they thought themselves bound to abdicate it
m
we chauvelin had himself called m
chauvelin m
decay martin m
caumartin m
dw constant aerobed que benjamin constant m
de lafayette m
lafayette
source trac had not wished to remain behind the rest and called himself plain source trac
we might almost so far as source tracks concerned stop here and confine ourselves to saying with regard to what remains for cour de grasse ethol oh yes
source trac had in fact that animation of youth which may be called the beaute du diable of the mind
later on this disappears like the playfulness of the kitten and all this grace ends with the bourgeois on two legs and with the tomcat on four paws
this sort of wit is transmitted from generation to generation of the successive levies of youth who traverse the schools who pass it from hand to hand quasi cur sites and is almost always exactly the same so that as we have just pointed out anyone who had listened to source gracin would have thought he heard thilo my rain
only source grace as an honorable fellow
beneath the apparent similarities of the exterior mind the difference between him and tho i oh yes was very great
the latent man which existed in the two was totally different in the first from what it was in the second
there was in thilo my esa district attorney and in cour de graca paladin
enjolras was the chief combe ferre was the guide source trac was the centre
the others have more light tested more warmth the truth is that he possessed all the qualities of a centre roundness and radiance
bw hotel had figured in the bloody tumult of june in the occasion of the burial of young lallemand
bw hotel was a good natured mortal who kept bad company brave a spendthrift prodigal and to the very dpf generosity talkative and at times eloquent bold to the verge of effrontery the best fellow possible he had dating waistcoats and scarlet opinions a wholesale blustered that is to say loving nothing so much as a quarrel unless it were an uprising and nothing so much as an uprising unless it were a revolution always ready to smash a window pane than to tear up the pavement then to demolish a government just to see the effect of its student in his eleventh year
he had nosed about the law but did not practise it
he had taken for his device never a lawyer and for his armorial bearings a night stand in which was visible a square cap
every time that he passed the law school which rarely happened he buttoned up his frock coat the paper it had not yet been invented and took hygienic precautions
of the school porter he said what a fine old man
and of the dean m
delvin court what a monument
in his lectures he espied subjects for ballads and in his professors occasions for caricature
he wasted a tolerably large allowance something like three thousand francs a year in doing nothing
he had peasant parents whom he had contrived to imbue with respect for their son
he said of them they are peasants and not bourgeois that is the reason they are intelligent
ha hotels man of caprice was scattered over numerous cafes the others had habits he had none
he sauntered
to stray is human
to saunter is parisian
in reality he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view
he served as a connecting link between the friends of the abc and other still in organized groups which were destined to take form later on
in this conclave of young heads there was one bald member
made a dime for having assisted him to enter a hackney coach on the day when he emigrated was done to relate that in on his return to france as the king was disembarking at calais a man handed him a petition
what is your request
said the king
sites post office
what is your name
the king frowned glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written this pestle
this non bono part to demography touched the king and he began to smile
site resumed the man with the petition i had for ancestors keeper of the hounds surnames league ules
this surname furnished my name
this caused the king to smile broadly
later on he gave the man the posting office of meaux either intentionally or accidentally
the bald member of the group was the son of this last leo riegle and he signed himself leclere meaux
as an abbreviation his companions called him bossuet
bossuet was a gay but unlucky fellow
his specialty was not to succeed in anything
as an offset he laughed at everything
at five and twenty he was bald
his father had ended by owning a house and a field by the the son had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation
he had nothing left
he possessed knowledge and wit but all he did miscarried
everything failed him and everybody deceived him what he was building tumbled down on top of him
if he were splitting wood he cut off a finger
if he had a mistress be speedily discovered that he had a friend also
some misfortune happened to him every moment hence his joviality
he said i live under talking tiles
he was not easily astonished because for him an accident was what he had foreseen he took his bad luck serenely and smiled at the teasing of fate like a person who is listening to pleasantries
he was poor but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible
he soon reached his last song ever his last burst of laughter
when adversity entered his door she saluted this old acquaintance cordially he tapped all catastrophes in the stomach he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname good day gulf non he said to it
these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive
he was full of resources
he had no money but he found means when it seemed good to him to indulge in unbridled extravagance
one night he went so far as to eat a hundred francs in a supper with a wench which inspires him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy pull off my boots you give louis jade
bossuet was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bw hotel
bossuet had not much domicile sometimes none at all
he lodged now with one now with another most often with joly
holy was studying medicine
he was two years younger than bosquet
holy was the malade imaginaire junior
what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor
at three and twenty he thought himself a vale tudo marian and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror
he affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle and in his chamber be placed his bed with its head to the south and the foot to the north so that at night the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe
during thunderstorms he felt his pulse
otherwise he was the gayest of the mall
all these young maniacal puny merry in coherences lived in harmony together and the results as an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades who were prodigal of winged consonants called to lilly
holy had a trick of touching his nose with the top of his cane which is an indication of a sagacious mind
all these young men who suffered so greatly and who on the whole can only be discussed seriously held the same religion progress
all were the direct sons of the french revolution
their fathers in the flesh had been either royalists doctrinaire z it matters not what this confusion anterior to themselves who were young did not concern them at all the pure blood of principle ran in their veins
they attached themselves without intermediate shades to incorruptible right and absolute city
affiliated and initiated they sketched out the ideal underground
among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds there was one sceptic
how game yet here
by juxtaposition
grant site was a man who took goods are not to believe in anything
he knew the best place for everything in addition boxing and foot fencing and some dances and he was a thorough single stick player
he was a tremendous drinker to boot
he stared tenderly and fixedly at all women with the air of saying to the mall if i only chose
and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand
all those words rights of the people rights of man the social contract the french revolution the republic democracy humanity civilization religion progress came very near to signifying nothing whatever to grant aire
he smiles at them
scepticism that varies of the intelligence had not left him a single whole idea
he lived with irony
this was his axiom there is but one certainty my full glass
he sneered at all devotion in all parties the father as well as the brother robespierre junior as well as loose rolled
they are greatly in advance to be dead he exclaimed
he said of the crucifix there is a gibbet which has been a success
air give henri iv
however this sceptic had one fanaticism
this fanaticism was neither a dog man of an idea nor an art nora science it was a man enjolras
grant site admired lived and generated enjolras
to whom did this anarchical scoffer unite himself in this phalanx of absolute minds
to the most absolute
in what manner had enjolras subjugated him
by his ideas
no
by his character
a phenomenon which is often observable
a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors
that which we lack attracts us
no one loves the light like the blind man
the dwarf adores the drum major
the road always has his eyes fixed in heaven
why
in order to watch the bird in its flight
grant aid find him writhed doubt loved to watch faith soar on enjolras
he had need of enjolras
that chaste healthy firm upright hard candid nature charmed him without his being clearly aware of it and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him
he admired his opposite by instinct
his soft yielding dislocated sickly shapeless ideas attached themselves to enjolras as to a spinal column
his moral backbone leaned on that firmness
grant site in the presence of enjolras became someone once more
he was himself moreover composed of two elements which were to all appearance incompatible
he was ironical and cordial
his indifference loved
his mind could get along with our belief but his heart could not get along without friendship
a profound contradiction for an affection is a conviction
his nature was this constituted
there are men who seem to be born to be the reverse the obverse the wrong side
they are pollux patrick danish send amidase p gestion pech mens
they only exist on condition that they are backed up with another man their name is a sequel and is only written preceded by the conjunction and and their existence is not their own it is the other side of an existence which is not theirs
grant site was one of these men
he was the obverse of enjolras
one might almost say that affinities begin with the letters of the alphabet
in the series land page inseparable
you can at will pronounce own door or rates and p glades
his joy was to see these forms go and come through the fumes of some
they tolerated him on account of his good humor
enjolras the believer disdained this sceptic and a sober man himself scorned this drunkard
be accorded him a little potty pity
grant sure was an unaccepted p glades
always harshly treated by enjolras roughly repulsed rejected yet ever returning to the charge he said of enjolras what fine marble
he had the air of a caryatid on a vacation he carried nothing but his revert however
he was staring at the place saint michel
laible de meaux was pondering without melancholy over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the law school and which had modified his personal plans for the future plans which were rather indistinct in any case
r every does not prevent a cab from passing by nor the dreamer from taking note of that can
laible de meaux whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging perceived a thwart his son nambul msn a two wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place at a colt pace and apparently in indecision
for whom was this cabriolet
why was it driving at a walk
pai gow took a survey
in it beside the coachman data young man and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky handbag
the bag displayed to passers by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was seen to the stuff marius pont mercy
this name caused laible to change his attitude
he drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet monsieur marius pont mercy
the cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt
the young man who also seemed deeply buried in thought raised his eyes hey
said he
you are m
marius pont mercy
certainly
i was looking for you resumed pai gow de meaux
how do
i do not know you
neither do i know you responded laible
marius thought he had encountered away the beginning of a mystification in the open street
he was not in a very good humor at the moment
he frowned
laible de meaux went on in perturba boy you were not at the school day before yesterday
that is possible
that is certain
you are a student
demanded marius
yes sir
like yourself
day before yesterday i entered the school by chance
you know one does have such freaks sometimes
the professor was just calling the roll
you are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions
at the third call unanswered your name is erased from the list
sixty france in the gulf
marius began to listen
it was blondeau who was making the call
you know blonde cute has a very pointed and very malicious nose and he delights to scent out the absent
he slyly began with the letter p
i was not listening not being compromised by that letter
the call was not going badly
no erasures the universe was present
blondes i was grieved
monsieur i have bowels of compassion
attention
here is a veritable mortal who is not exact
here is none of your heavy sides a student who studied a greenhorn pedant string of letters theology science and salience one of those full site cut by the square spin by profession
he is an honorable idler who lounges who practises country jaunts who cultivates the gross the who pays court to the fair sex who is at this very moment perhaps with my mistress
let us save him
death to blondeau
monsieur
said marius
and why i was added laible de meaux
i do not understand you said marius
la ogle resumed nothing is more simple
i was close to the desk to reply and close to the door for the purpose of flight
the professor taxed at me with a certain intensity
all of a sudden blondeau who must be the malicious nose alluded to by boileau skipped to the letter l
l is my letter
i am from meaux and my name is keeble
interrupted marius what fine name
that said he crossed me off
marius exclaimed i am mortified sir first of all interposed lainie i demand permission to embalm blondeau in a few phrases of deeply felt full gium
i will assume that he is dead
there will be no great change required in his faintness in his pallor in his coldness and in his shell
he relies blondeau blondeau the nose blondeau basic atheos of discipline box disciplinary he bloodhound of the password the angel of the roll call who was upright square exact rigid honest and hideous
god crossed him off as he crossed me off
in future be exact
i really beg you a thousand pardons
do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again
i am extremely sorry laible burst out laughing
and i am delighted
i was on the brink of becoming a lawyer
this erasure saves me
i renounce the triumphs of the bar
i shall not defend the widow and i shall not attack the orphan
no more tobago more stage
here is my erasure all ready for me
it is to you that i am indebted for it monsieur pont mercy
i intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you
where do you live
in this can said marius
a sign of opulence retorted pai gow calmly
i congratulate you
you have there arent of nine thousand francs per annum
at that moment source trac emerged from the cafe
marius smiled sadly
come to my places it said courts head
i have the priority observed pai gow but i have no home
hold your tongue bossuet said source gras
bossuet said marius but i thought that your name was laible
we meaux replied pai gow by metaphor bosquet
source trac entered the cab
coachman said he hotel de la porte saint jacques
and that very evening marius found himself installed in a chain fr of the hotel de la porte saint jacques side by side with source trac
youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars
source trac put no questions to him
he did not even think of such a thing
at that are facts disclose everything on the spot
words are superfluous
there are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter
one looks at them and one knows them
one morning however source trax abruptly addressed this interrogation to him by the way have you any political opinions
the idea
said marius almost affronted by the question
what are you
a democrat bonapartist
the gray hue of a reassured rat said source trac
on the following day source trac introduced marius at the cafe husain
then he whispered in his ear with a smile i must give you your entry to the revolution
and he led him to the hall of the friends of the abc
he presented him to the other comrades saying this simple word which marius did not understand a pupil
however although he was silent and grave he was nonetheless both winged and armed
marius up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy and to a sides both by habit and by taste was a little fluttered by this corey of young men around him
all these various initiatives solicited his attention at once and pulled him about
the tumultuous movements of these kinds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl
sometimes in his trouble they flew so far from him that he had difficulty in recovering them
he heard them talk of philosophy of literature of art of history of religion in unexpected fashion
he caught glimpses of strange aspects and as he did not place them in proper perspective he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped
the angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced a new
a certain oscillation see all the horizons of his brains in motion
an odd internal upsetting
he almost suffered from it
it seemed as though there were no consecrated things for those young men
marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject which embarrassed his still timid mind
a theatre poster presented itself adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called classic down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois
cried bw hotel
and marius heard combe ferre reply you are wrong bw hotel
the bourgeoisie loves tragedy and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score
be signed tragedy has a reason for its existence and i am not one of those who by order of aeschylus contest its right to existence
there are rough outline sin nature there are in creation ready made parodies a beam which is not a beam wings which are not wings bills which are not hills laws which are not pass a cry of pain which aroused a desire to laugh there is the duck
now since poultry exists by the side of the bird i do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy
it chance decreed that marius should traverse rue jean jacques rousseau between enjolras and coutts trac
court eurac took his arm pay attention
this is the fuel karriere now called rue jean jacques rousseau on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago
this consisted of jean jacques and therese
from time to time little beings were born there
there we gave birth to them jean jacques represented them as foundlings
and enjolras addressed court eurac roughly silence in the presence of jean jacques
i admire that may
he denied his own children that may be but he adopted the people
not one of these young men articulated the word the emperor
jean proud wire alone sometimes said napoleon all the others said bonaparte
enjolras pronounced it buonaparte
marius was vaguely surprised
initium sapientia e
chapter iv the backroom of the cafe musa on one of the conversations among the young men at which marius was present and in which he sometimes joined was a veritable shock to his mind
this took place in the backroom of the cafe husain
nearly all the friends of the abc has convened that evening
the art and lamp was solemnly lighted
they talked of one thing and another without passion and with noise
with the exception of enjolras and marius who held their peace all were haranguing rather at haphazard
conversations between comrade a sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults
it was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation
they tossed words to eachother and caught them up in turn
they were chattering in all quarters
no woman was admitted to this backroom except louis on the dishwasher of the cats who passed through it from time to time to go to her washing in the lavatory
grant site thoroughly drunk was deafening the corner of which he had taken possession reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs and shouting i am thirsty
mortals i am dreaming that the fun of heidelberg has an attack of apoplexy and that i am one of the dozen leeches which will be applied to it
i want a drink
i desire to forget life
life is a hideous invention of i know not whom
it lasts no time at all and is worth nothing
life is a theatre set in which there are but few practicable entrances
happiness is an antique reliquary painted on one side only
zero not wishing to go stark naked clothes himself insanity
o vanity
the patching up of everything with big words

vanity has a right and a wrong side the right side is stupid it is the negro with his glass beads the wrong side is foolish it is the philosopher with his tags
i weep over the one and i laugh over the other
what are called honors and dignities and even dignity and honor are generally of pinchbeck
kings make playthings of human pride
caligula made a horse a consul charles ii
made a knight of a sirloin
wrap yourself up now then between consul incitatus and baronet roast beef
as for the intrinsic value of people it is no longer respectable in the least
listen to the panegyric which neighbor makes of neighbor

it is a shame that i am ignorant otherwise i would quote to you a mass of things but i know nothing

so much for myself as for the rest of you you are worth no more than i am
i scoff at your perfections excellencies and qualities
whom do you admire the slain of the slayer caesar or brutus
generally men are in favor of the slayer
long live brutus he has slain
there lies the virtue
virtue granted but madness also
there are queer spots on those great men
the brutus who killed caesar was in love with the statue of a little boy
this statue was from the hand of the greek sculptor strong y lion who also carved that figure of an amazon known as the beautiful legs us memos which nero carried with him in his travels
this strong you in left but two statues which placed nero and brutus in accord
brutus was in love with the one nero with the other
all history is nothing but wearisome repetition
one century is the plagiarist of the other
the battle of marengo copies the battle of phe ha the tolbiac of clovis and the austerlitz of napoleon areas like each other as two drops of water
nothing is so stupid as to conquer true glory lies in convincing
but try to prove something
if you are content with success what mediocrity and with conquering what wretchedness
alas vanity and cowardice everywhere
everything obeys success even grammar
sickle the us says horace
therefore i disdain the human race
shall we descend to the party at all
do you wish me to begin admiring the peoples

shall it be greece
the athenians those parisians of days gone by slew phocion as we might say coligny and dawned upon tyrants to such an extent that an ace phorus said if pisistratus his urine attracts the fees
the most prominent man in greece for fifty years was that grammarian phile has who was so small and within that he was obliged to lose his shoes with lead in order not to be blown away by the wind
there stood on the great square in corinth a statue carved by all anion and catalogued by plight his statue represented epic that es

thus did grant wire more than intoxicated launch into speech catching at the dishwasher in her passage from his corner in the backroom of the cafe husain

resumed bossuet who was discussing a point of law behind the scenes and who was plunged more than waist high in a phrase of judicial slang of which this is the conclusion and as for me although i am hardly al trust and at the most an amateur attorney i maintain this that in accordance with the terms of the customs of normandy at saint michel and for each year an equivalent must be paid to the profit of the lord of the manor saving the rights of others and by all and several the proprietors as well as those seized with inheritance and that for all empty true releases free hoods contracts of domain mortgages echo plaintive nymph hummer grant aire
near grammaire an almost silent tables sheet of paper an inkstand and a pen between two glasses of brandy announced that a vaudeville was being sketched out
this great affair was being discussed in a low voice and the two heads at work touched each other let us begin by finding names
when one has the names one finds the subject
that is true

i will write

beside the vaudeville aspirants another group which was also taking advantage of the uproar to talk low was discussing a duel
an old fellow of thirty was counselling a young one of eighteen and explaining to him what sort of an adversary he had to deal with
the deuce
lookout for yourself
he is a fine swordsman
his play is next

in the angle opposite grant aid emily and ba hotel were playing dominoes and talking of love

the spirit of each is sovereign i est suffices to open the field to the unexpected
these are conversation e with abrupt turns in which the perspective changes suddenly
chance is the stage manager of such conversations
a severe thought starting oddly from a clash of words suddenly traversed the conflict of ships in which grants irena hotel proud site bossuet combe ferre and source trac were confusedly fencing
how does a phrase crop up in a dialogue
whence comes it that it suddenly impress ec itself on the attention of those who hear it
we have just said that no one knows anything about it
in the midst of the uproar bossuet all at once terminated some apostrophe to combe ferre with this date june theater pop
at this name of waterloo marius who was leaning his elbows on a table beside a glass of water removed his wrist from beneath his chin and began to gaze fixedly at the audience
larrieu
exclaimed court eur asp arg leu was falling into disuse at this period that number is strange and strikes me
place louis in front and brumaire behind you have the whole destiny of the man with this significant peculiarity that the end treads close on the heels of the commencement
enjolras who had remained mute up to that point broke the silence and addressed this remark to combe ferre you mean to say the crime and the expiation
this word crime over passed the measure of what marius who was already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of waterloo could accept
he rose walked slowly to the map of france spread out on the wall and at whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment laid his finger on this compartment and said corsica a little island which has rendered france very great
this was like a breath of ict aid
all ceased talking
they felt that something was on the point of occurring
bw hotel replying to bossuet was just assuming an attitude of the torso to which he was addicted
he gave it up to listen
enjolras whose blue eye was not fixed on anyone and who seemed to be gazing at space replied without glancing at marius france needs no corsica to be great
france is great because she is france
qui a nominal eo
mark is felt no desire to retreat he turned towards enjolras and his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very being god forbid that i should diminish france
but amalgamating napoleon with her is not diminishing her
come
let us argue the question
i am a newcomer among you but i will confess that you amaze me
where do we stand
who are we
who are you

let us come to an explanation about the emperor
i hear you say buonaparte accenting the u like the royalists
i thought you were young men
where the nod your enthusiasm
and what are you doing with it
who i do you admire if you do not admire the emperor
and what more do you want
if you will have none of that great man what great men would you like
he had everything
he was complete
he had in his brain the sum of human faculties
he made codes like justinian be dictated like caesar his conversation was mingled with the lightning flash of pascal with the thunderclap of tacitus he made history and he wrote it his bulletins are iliad she combines the cipher of newton with the metaphor of mahomet he left behind him in the east words as great as the pyramids at tilsit he taught emperors majesty at the academy of science she replied top a place in the council of state beheld his own against merlin he gave a soul to the geometry of the first and to the chicanery of the last news sale fiat with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers like cromwell blowing out one of two candles he went to the temple to bargain for a curtain tassel he saw everything he knew everything which did not prevent him from laughing good naturedly beside the cradle of his little child and all at once frightened europe left a near armies out themselves in motion parks of artillery rumbled pontoons stretched over the tigers clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm cries trumpets a trembling of the ones in every direction the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map the sound of a superhuman sword was heard as it was drawn from its sheath they beheld him time is effect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand and a glow in his eyes unfolding amid the thunder his two wings the grand army and the old guard and he was the archangel of war
all held their peace and enjolras bowed his head
silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence of the enemy being driven to the wall
marius continued with increased enthusiasm and almost without pausing for breath let us be just my friends
what a splendid destiny for a nation to be the empire of such an emperor when that nation is france and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man
to appear and foreign to march and to triumph to have for halting places all capitals to take his grenadiers and to make kings of them to decree the falls of dynasties and to transfigure europe at the pace of a charge to make you feel that when you threaten you lay your hand on the hilt of the sword of god to follow in a single man hannibal caesars harlem anne to be the people of someone who mingles with your dawns the startling announcement of a battle won to have the cannon of the invalid ector once you in the morning you url into abysses of light prodigious words which flame forever marengo arcola austerlitz jena wagram
to cause constellations of victories to flash for that each instant from the zenith of the centuries to make the french empire a pendant to the roman empire to be the great nation and to give birth to the grand army to make its legions fly forth over all the earth as a mountain sends out its eagles on all sides to conquer to dominate to strike with lightning to be in europe a sort of nation glides through glory to sound athwart the centuries a trumpet blast of titans to conquer the world twice by conquest and by dazzling that is sublime and what greater thing is there
to be free said combe ferre
marius lowered his head in his turn that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel and he felt it vanishing within him
when he raised his eyes combe ferre was no longer there
probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis he had just taken his departure and all with the exception of enjolras had followed him
the room had been emptied
enjolras left alone with marius was gazing gravely at him
marius however having rallied his ideas to some extent did not consider himself beaten there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was in the point no doubt of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against enjolras when all of a sudden they heard someone singing on the stairs as he went
the wild and tender accents with which combe ferre sang communicated to this couplets sort of strange grandeur
marius thoughtfully and with his eyes filed on the ceiling repeated almost mechanix ally my mother
citizen said enjolras to him my mother is the republic
chapter birds angusta that evening left marius profoundly shaken and with a melancholy shadow in his soul
he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within if it feels only the wound the quiver of the germans the joy of the fruit only arrive later
marius was gloomy
he had but just acquired a faith must be then reject it already
he affirmed to himself that he would not
he declared to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
marius was clear eyes and be required the true light
the half lights of doubt palmer him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
whither would thus lead him
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to how take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
an escarpment rose around him
he was in accord neither with his grandfather not with his friends dating in the eyes of the one he was behind the times in the eyes of the others and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated on the side of age and on the side of youth
he ceased to go to the cafe husain
in the troubled state of his conscience be no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
the realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten
they soon elbowed him abruptly
yes
but i must have my money
request source trac to come and talk with me said marius
source trac having made his appearance the host left them
marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate that he was the same as alone in the world and had no relatives
what is to become of you
said source trac
i do not know in the least replied marius
what are you going to do
i do not know
have you any money
fifteen france
do you want me to lend you some
never
have you clothes
here is what i have
have you trinkets
a watch
silver
gold here it is
i know a clothes dealer who will take your frock coat and a pair of trousers
that is good
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waist cosham at a new coat
and my boots
what
you will not go barefoot
what opulence
that will be enough
i know a watchmaker who will buy your watch
that is good
no it is not good
what will you do after that
whatever is necessary
anything honest that is to say
do you know english
no
do you know german
no
so much the worse
why
because one of my friends a publisher is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia for which you might have translated english or german articles
it is badly paid work but one can live by it
i will learn english and german
and in the meanwhile
in the meanwhile i will live on my clothes and my watch
the clothes dealer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments
he bought the watch for forty five france
that is not bad said marius to four get tax on their return to the hotel with my fifteen francs that makes eighty
and the hotel bill
observed courte trac
hello i had forgotten that said marius
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
if amounted to seventy france
i have ten france left said marius
the deuce exclaimed court eye as you will eat up five france while you are learning english and five while learning german
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred so is very slowly
one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty pistoles that is to say six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty logic to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he has three france left
his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him
besides had he not said let me never hear the name of that blood drinker again
marius left the hotel de la porte saint jacques as he did not wish to run in debt there
book fifth
the excellence of misfortune chapter i marius indigent illustration excellence of misfortune f misfortune life became hard for marius
it was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch
years of that terrible inexpressible thing that is called de la vache engage that is to say he endured great hardships and privations
marius learned how all this is eaten and how such are often the only things which one has to devour
at that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride because he needs love he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed and ridiculous because he was poor
at the age when you the wells the heart with imperial pride he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness
admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base from which the strong emerge sublime
a crucible into which destiny casts a man whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demigod
for many great deeds are performed in petty combats
there are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitude s
noble and mysterious triumphs which no eye beholds which are required with no renown which are saluted with no trumpet blast
life misfortune isolation abandonment poverty are the fields of battle which have their heroes obscure heroes who are sometimes grander than the heroes who won renown
firm and rare natures are thus created misery almost always a stepmother is sometimes another destitution gives birth to night of soul and spirit distress is the nurse of pride in happiness is a good milk for the magnanimous
it was marine
on this cutlet which he cooked for himself he lived for three days
on the first day he ate the meat on the second heard the vat on the third he gnawed the bone
aunt gillen or hand made repeated attempts and sent him the sixty pistoles several times
marius returned them on every occasion saying that he needed nothing
he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him
from that time forth he had not put off his black garments
but his garments were quitting him
the day came when he had no longer a coat
the trousers would go next
what was to be done
courts trac to whom he had on his side done some good turns gave him an old coat
for thirty sous marius got it turned by some porter or other and it was a new coat
but this coat was green
then mark is ceased to go out until after nightfall
this made his coat black
as he wished always to appear in mourning be clothed himself with the night
in spite of all this he got admitted to practice as a lawyer
when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect
n
ville normans trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four pieces and threw it into the wastebasket
two or three days later mademoiselle ville norm and heard her father who was alone in his room talking aloud to himself
he always did this whenever he was greatly agitated
she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a fool you would know that one can not be a baron and a lawyer at the same time
chapter ii marius poor it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else
it ends by becoming bearable
it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself
one vegetated that is to say one develops in a certain meagre fashion which is however sufficient for life
this is the mode in which the existence of marius pont mercy was arranged he had passed the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him
by dint of toil perseverance courage and will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year
he had learned german and english thanks to source trac who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house
he drew up prospectuses translated newspapers annotated editions compiled biographies etc
net product year in and tear out seven hundred francs
he lived only
how
not so badly
we will explain
marius occupied in the goffeau house for an annual sum of thirty frames aden minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture
this furniture be lobbed to him
he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole and to bring him a little bit water every morning a fresh egg and a penny roll
he breakfasted on this egg and roll
his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs were dead or cheap
h date mo soup
he took a six soup late of me at a half portion of vegetables for three sous and a three sou dessert
for three sous he got as much bread as he wished
as for wine he drank water
when he paid at the desk where madam rousseau at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided he gave as ok to the waiter and madam rousseau gave him a smile
then he went away
for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner
this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied was a calming potion rather than a restaurant
it no longer exists
the idol did not had a fine nickname he was called rousseau the aquatic
thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sousa day which made three hundred and sixty five francs a year
add the thirty francs for rent and the thirty six franca to the old woman plus a few trifling expenses for four hundred and fifty france marius wasted lodged and waited on
his clothing cost him a hundred francs his linen fifty france his washing fifty francs the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty france
he was rich
be some time spent ten france to a friend
source trac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him
as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he had simplified matters
markus always had two complete suite of clothes the one old for everyday the other brand new for special occasions
both were black
he renewed them as they wore out
they were always ragged which caused him to button his coat to the chin
it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing condition
hard years difficult some of them to traverse others to climb
marius had not failed for a single day
he had endured everything in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debts
he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed anyone as ok
a debt was to him the beginning of slavery
he even said to himself that a creditor is worse than a master for the master possesses only your persona credit or possesses your dignity and can administer to its box on the ear
rather than borrow he went without food
he had passed many a day fasting
such and such a formality of action which in any other situation would have appeared merely a reference to him now seemed in solidity and he needed himself against it
his face wore a sort of severe flush
he was timid even to rudeness
during all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uklug yet at times by a secret force that he possessed within himself
the soul side the body and at certain moments raises it
it is the only bird which bears up its own care
he never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them in his generation
it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for thenardier
what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards the barrier was the idea of the distress into which he knew that the barrier had fallen and which has engulfed the latter
marius had learned at mont vermeil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate innkeeper
since that time he had made unheard of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which thenardier had disappeared
marius had beaten the whole country he had gone to chelles to bondy to tourney to nogent to lanny
he had persisted for three years exp ending in these explorations the little money which he had laid by
no one had been able to give him any news of thenardier he was supposed to have gone abroad
his creditors had also sought him with less love than marius but with as much assiduity and had not been able to lay their hands on him
markus blames himself and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches
it was the only debt left him by the colonel and marius made it a matter of honor to pay it
what he thought when my father lay dying on the field of battle did then she let contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grapeshot and hear him off on his shoulders and yet he owed him nothing and i who owe so much to thenardier can not join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death and in my turn bring him back from death to life
oh
i will find him
to find the barrier in fact marius would have given one of his arms to rescue him from his misery he would have sacrificed all his blood
to see the barrier to render the barrier some service to say to him you do not know me well i do know you
here i am
disp use of me
chapter iii marius grown up at this epoch marius was twenty years of age
it was three years since he had left his grandfather
both parties had remained on the same terms without attempting to approach each other and without seeking to see each other
besides what was the use of seeing each other
marius was the brass base while father ville norm and was the iron pot
he had imagined that m
gil lenormand had never loved him and that that crusty harsh and smiling old fellow who cursed shouted and stormed and brandished his cane cherished for him at the most only that affection which is at once slight and severe of the di garda of comedy
marius was in error
there are fathers who do not love their children there exists no grandes they who does not adore his grandson
at bottom as we have said m
gil lenormand idolized marius
he idolized him after his own fashion with an act okla moment of snappish news and boxes on the ear but this child once gone he felt a black gold in his heart he would allow no one to mention the child to him and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed
at first he hoped that this buona p artist this jacob in this terrorist this septembrie t would return
but the weeks passed by years passed tom
i could not do otherwise than turn him out said the grandfather to himself and he asked himself if the thing were to do over again would i do it
his price instantly answered yes but his aged head which he shook in silence replied sadly no
he had his hours of depression
he hissed marius
old men need affection as they need the sun
it is warmth
strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some change in him
nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards that rogue but he suffered
he never inquired about him but he thought of him incessantly
he lived in the marais in a more and more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but his merriment had a convulsive harshness and his violences always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy rejection
he sometimes said ok
if he only would return what a good box on the war i would give him
as for his aunt she thought too little to love much marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the paris yet which she probably had
his sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke
it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius and asked him what is your grandson doing
what has become of him
the old bourgeois replied with a sigh that he was a sad case and giving a fillip to his cuff if he wished to appear gay monsieur le baron de lint mercy is practising pdt to dogging in some corner or other
while the old man regretted marius applauded himself
as is the case with all good hearted people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness
he only thought of m
top lenormand in an amiable light but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father
this was the mitigated translation of his first indignation
moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering stilo
the hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him
he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that had it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a father
that in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel had meant to imply by the words he will be worthy of it
and then on the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors he had been only a child now he was a man
he felt it
misery we repeat had been good for him
poverty in youth when it succeeds has this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards effort and the whole soul towards aspiration
poverty instantly page material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life
the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions horse races hunting dogs tobacco gaming good repasts and all the rest of it occupations for the baser side of the soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides
the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has eaten he has nothing more but meditation
he goes to the spectacles which god furnished gratis he gazed at the sky space the stars flowers children the humanity among which he is suffering the creation amid which he teams
he gazed so much on humanity that he perceives its soul he gazed upon creation to such an extent that he beholds god
he dreams he feels himself breathe dreams on and feels himself tender
from the egotism of the man who suffer she passes to the compassion of the man who meditates
an admirable sentiment breaks forth in him forgetfulness of self and pity for all
as he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offers gives and lavishes go souls which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to put the the million name for the mind the million naire of money
all hatred departs from his heart in proportion a slight penetrates his spirit
and is he unhappy
no
the misery of a young man is never miserable
the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes his warmly circulating blood his black hair his red lips his white teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor
and then every morning he sets himself a fresh to the task of earning his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column gains price his brain gathers ideas
his task finished he returns to ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joy she beholde his feet set in afflictions in obstacles on the pavement in the nettles sometimes in the mire his head on the light
he is firm serene gentle peaceful attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks work which makes him free and thought which makes him dignified
this is what had happened with marius
to tell the truth be inclined a little too much to the side of contemplation
from the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty he had stopped thinking it good to be poor and retrenching time from his work to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire days in meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance
he had thus propounded the problem of his life to toil as little as possible at material labor in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable in other words to bestow a few hours on real life and to cast the rest to the infinite
as he believed that he lacked nothing he did not perceive that contemplation this understood ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness that he was contenting himself with conquering the first necessities of life and that he was resting from his labors too soon
it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this could only be a transitory state and that at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken
in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father nil lenormand thought about the matter he was not practising he was not even perri fogging
meditation had turned him aside from pleading
to haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt up cases what a bore
why should be doit
he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood
the obscure and ill paid publishing establishment had come to mean for him a sure source of work which did not involve too much labor as we have explained and which sufficed for his wants
one of the publishers for whom he worked m
magimel i think offered to take him into his own house to lodge him well to furnish him with regular occupation and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year
to be well lodged
fifteen hundred francs
no doubt
but renounce his liberty
being used wages
a sort of hired man of letters
he refused
marius dwelt in solitude
owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything and through having been too much alarmed he had not entered decidedly into the group presided over by enjolras
they had remained good friends they were ready to assist each other on occasion in every possible way but nothing more
marius had two friends one young source urac and one old m
man eur
he inclined more to the old man
in the first place he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him to him he was indebted for having known and loved his father
he operated on me for a cataract he said
the churchwarden had certainly played a decisive part
it was not however that m
have it had been anything but the calm and impassive agent or providence in this connection
he had enlightened marius by chance and without being aware of the fact as does a candle which someone brings he had been the candle and not the someone
have it was totally incapable of comprehending it or willing or of directing it
as we shall seek
have it again later on a few words will not be superfluous
chapter iv m
have it on the day when m
mabe he said to marius certainly i approve or political opinions he expressed the real state of his mind
all political opinions were matters of indifference to him and he approved them all without distinction provided they left him in peace as the greeks called the furies the beautiful the good the charming the eumenides
m
like all the rest of the world he possessed the termination inist without which no one could exist at that time but he was neither a royalists bonapartist a chartist a girl danish not an anarchist he was an ou qui just a collector of old books
he did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other hs cause of silly stuff like the charter democracy legitimacy monarchy the republic etc
when there were in the world all sorts of bosses grasses and shrubs which they might be looking at and heaps of folios and even if los which they might turnover
he took goods are not to become useless having books did not prevent his reading being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener
m
have it had succeeded in producing seedling pears as savory as the pears of st
germain it is from one of his combinations apparently that the october mirabelle now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer mirabelle owes its origin
he went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety and because as he loved the facts of men but hated their noise he found them assembled and silent only in church
feeling that he must be something in the state he had chosen the career of warden
however he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bilby or any man as much as an elzevir
he had long passed sixty when one day someone asked him have you never been married
i have forgotten said he
when it sometimes happened to him and to whom does it not happen
today on
if i were only rich
it was not when ogling a pretty girl as was the case with father gil lenormand but when contemplating a good book
he lived alone with an old housekeeper
he was somewhat youth and when he was asleep his ages fingers stiffened with rheumatism lays rolled up in the folds of his sheets
he had composed and published a flora of the environs of cauterets with colored plates a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well
people ran this belkin the rue mezieres two or three times a day to ask for it
he sees as much as two thousand francs a year from it this constitutes nearly the whole of his fortune
although poor he had had the talent to form for himself by dint of patience privations and time a precious collection of rare copies of every sort
he never went out without a book under his arm and he often returned with two
the sole decoration of the four rooms on the ground floor which composed his lodgings consisted of framed herbarium sand engravings of the old masters
the sight of a sword of a gun chilled his blood
he had never approached a cannon in his life even at the invalides
he had a passable stomach a brother who was a cure perfectly white hair no teeth either in his mouth of his mind a trembling in every limb a picard accent an infantile laugh the air of an old sheep and he was easily frightened
add to this that he had no other friendship no other acquaintance among the loving than an old bookseller of the ports saint jacques naked royal
his dream was to naturalize indigo in france
his servant was also a sort of innocent
the poor good old woman was a spinster
none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man
she had never been able to get further than her cat
like him she had a mustache
her glory consisted in her caps which were always white
she passed her time on sundays after mass in counting over the linen in her chest and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought and never had made up
she knew how to read
m
have it had nicknamed her mother plug atque
m
have it had taken a fancy to marius because marius being young and gentle warned his age without startling his timidity
youth combined with gentleness produced on old people the effect of the sun without wind
when marius was saturated with military glory with gunpowder with marches and counter marches and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword he went to week
mabey ranch

his brother the cure died about and almost immediately as when the night is drawing on the whole horizon grew dark form

the revolution of july brought a crisis to publishing
in a period of embarrassment the first thing which does not sell is a flora
the flora of the environs of cauterets stopped short
weeks passed by without a single purchaser
sometimes m
have it started at the sound of the bell
monsieur said mother plug atque sadly it is the water carrier
in short one day m
he carried off his flora his copper plates his herbarium show portfolios and his books and established himself near the salpetriere in a sort of thatched cottage of the village of austerlitz where for fifty crowns a year he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge and containing a well
he took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture
on the day of his entrance into his new quarters he was very gay and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbarium s were to hang with his own hands dog in his garden the rest of the day and at night left giving that mother plug atque had a melancholy air and was very thoughtful he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile we have the indigo
only two visitors the bookseller of the ports saint jacques and marine were admitted to view the thatched cottage at austerlitz a brawling name which was to tell the truth extremely disagreeable to him
however as we have just pointed out brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom of folly or as it often happens in both at once are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life
their own destiny is a far off thing to them
there results from such concentrations passivity which if it were the outcome of reasoning would resemble philosophy
it always ends it is true in an awakening but the awakening is tardy
on the meantime it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness
we are the stake and we look on at the game with indifference
it is thus that athwart the cloud which formed about him when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other m
have it remained rather puerile it but profoundly serene
his habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum
once mounted on an illusion he went for a very long time even after the illusion had disappeared
a clock does not stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost
m
have it had his innocent pleasures
these pleasures were inexpensive and unexpected the merest chance furnished them
one day mother plug atque was reading a romance in one corner of the room
she was reading aloud finding that she understood better thus
there are people who read very loud and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing
it was with this sort of energy that mother plug atque was reading the romance which she had in hand
m
man eur heard her without listening to her
in the course of her reading mother pluta take came to this phrase
it was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty the beauty poured and the dragoon here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses
bouddha and the dragon struck in m
have it in a low voice
yes it is true that there was a dragon which from the depths of its save spouted flame through his jaw and set the heavens on fire
many stars had already been consumed by this monster which besides had the class of a tiger
bouddha went into its demand succeeded in converting the dragon
that is a good book that you are reading mother pour atque
there is no more beautiful legend in existence
and m
have it fell into a delicious revert
chapter v poverty a good neighbor for misery marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the clutches of indi hence and who came to feel astonishment little by little without however being made melancholy by it
marius metcourt eurac and sought out m
man eur
very rarely however twice a month at most
he often spent half a day in gazing at a marketgarden the beds of lettuce the chickens on the dung heap the horse turning the water wheel
the passers by stared at him instr pride and some of them though this attire suspicious and his mnem sinister
he was only a poor young man dreaming in an object less way
it was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the gorge zu house and tempted by its isolation and its cheapness had taken up his abode there
he was known there only under the name of m
marius
marius had not refused their invitations
they afforded opportunities of talking about his father
thus he went from time to time to comte paull to general bell avec nero general tridion to the invalides
there was music and dancing there
on such evenings marius put on his new coat
but he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was free sign cold because he could not afford a carriage and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors
he said sometimes but without bitterness men are so made that in a drawing room you may be a oiled everywhere except on your store
in order to insure a good reception there only one irreproachable thing is asked if you your conscience
nk your boots
all passions except those of the heart are dissipated by revert
the revolution of assisted in the process by satisfying and calming him
he remained the same setting aside his fits of wrath
he still held the same opinions
only they had been tempered
to speak accurately he had no longer any opinions he had sympathies
to what party did he belong
to the party of humanity
out of humanity he chose france out of the nation he chose the people out of the people he chose the woman
it was to that point above all that his pity was directed
now he preferred an idea to a feeds post to a hero and he admired a book like job more than an event like marengo
and then when after a day spent in meditation he returned in the evening through the boulevards and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond the nameless gleams the abyss the shadow the mystery all that which is only human seemed very petty indeed to him
he thought that he had and he really had in fact arrived at the truth of life and of human philosophy and he had ended by gazing at nothing but heaven the only thing which truth can perceive from the bottom of her well
this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans his combinations his scaffolding show projects for the future
in fact had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams than according to what he thinks
there is fill in thought there is none in dreams
r every which is utterly spontaneous takes and keeps even in the gigantic and the ideal the form of our spirit
nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul than our unpremeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny
in these aspirations much more than in deliberate rational coordinated ideas is the real character of a man to be found
our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us
each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance with his nature
towards the middle of this year the old woman who waited on marius told him that his neighbors the wretched jon dee the family had been turned out of doors
marius who passed nearly the whole of his days out of the house hardly knew that he had any neighbors
why are they turned out
he asked
because they do not pay their rent they owe for two quarters
how much is it
twenty france said the old woman
marius had thirty france saved up in a drawer
here he said to the old woman take these twenty five france
pay for the poor people and give them five feet cs and do not tell them that it was i
chapter vi the substitute it chanced that the regiment to which lieutenant theory of belonged came to perform garrison duty in paris
this inspired aug triple normand with a second idea
at all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vagueness of a young face in the house these days of dawn are sometimes sweet to ruin it was expedient to find another marius
take it as a simple erratum she thought such as one sees in books
for marius read the odule
a grandnephew is almost the same as a grandson in default of a lawyer one takes a lancer
one morning when m
bill storm and was about to read something in the quotidienne his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice for the question concerned her favorite father the odule is coming to present his respects to you this morning
your grandnephew
ah
said the grandfather
then he went back to his reading thought no more of his grandnephew who was merely some theo rule or other and soon flew into a fate which almost always happened when he read
the sheet which he held although royalist of course announced for the following day without any softening phrases one of these little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in paris that the students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the place du pantheon at midday to deliberate
the students were to deliberate over this
it did not take much more than this roswell m
he thought of marius who was a student and who would probably go with the rest to deliberate at midday on the place du pantheon
as he was indulging in this painful dream lieutenant theory is entered clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois which was clever of him and was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle bolle normand
the lancer had reasoned as follows the old druid has not sunk all his money in a life pension
mademoiselle ville norm and said aloud to her father theory of your grandnephew
and on a low voice to the lieutenant approve of everything
and she withdrew
the lieutenant who was but little accustomed to such venerable encounters stammered with some timidity good day uncle and made a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute
ah
that said he totally forgot the lancer
the odule seated himself and m
gil lenormand rose
m
guile high and began to pace back and forth his hands in his pockets talking aloud and twitching with his irritated old fingers at the two watches which he wore in his two dogs
that lack of brats
they convene on the place dj pantheon
by my life
urchins who were with their horses but yesterday
if one were to squeeze their noses milk would burst out
and they deliberate tomorrow at midday
what are we coming to
what are we coming to
it is clear that we are making for the abyss
that is what the desc amid a dos have brought us to
to deliberate on the citizen artillery
to go and jabber in the open air over the mines of the national guard
and with whom are they to meet there
just see whither jacobin i am leads
i will get anything you like a million against a counter that there will be no one there but returned convicts and released galley slaves
the republicans and the galley slaves they form but one nose and one handkerchief
that is true said the odule
m
gil lenormand half turned his head saw the odule and went on when one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonaro
why did you leave my house
to go and become a republican
pssst
in the first place the people want none of your republic they have common sense they know well that there always have been kings and that there always will be they know well that the people are only the people after all they make door to fit of your republic do you understand idiot
is it not a horrible caprice
they are all alike
not one escapes
it suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the street to lose their senses
the nineteenth century is poison
what does that mean romantic
some tue favor to tell me what it is
all possible follies
a year ago they ran to hernani
now i just ask you hernani
antitheses
abominations which are not even written in french
and then they have cannons in the courtyard of the louvre
such a rather as calories of this age
you are right uncle said the odule
m
ville norm and resumed cannons in the courtyard of the museum
for what purpose
do you want to fire grapeshot at the apollo belvedere
what have those cartridges to do with the venus de medici
oh
the young men of the present day see all blackguards
what a pretty creature is their benjamin constant
and those who are not rascals are simpletons
they do all they can to make themselves ugly they are badly dressed they are afraid of women in the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the girls into fits of laughter in my word of honor one would say the poor creatures were ashamed of love
one might make use of their jargon to put news oleson their old shoes
and all this awkward batch of brats has political opinions if you please
political opinions should be strictly forbidden
ah
marius
ah
you blackguard
to go and voc iterate on the public place
to discuss to debate to take measures
they call that measures just god
disorder humbles itself and becomes silly
i have seen chaos know see a mess
students deliberating on the national guard such a thing could not be seen among the ovine was not the car peaches
savages who go naked with their god does dressed like a shuttlecock with a club in their paws are less of brutes than those bachelors of arts
the four lenny monkeys
and they set up for judges
those creatures deliberate and ratios image
the end of the world is some
this is plainly the end of this mixed able tree aqueous globe
a final hiccough was required and brands he admitted it
deliberate my rascals
such things will happen so long as they go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the odeon
that costs them as ok and their good sense and their intelligence and their heart and their soul and their wits
they emerge thence and decamp from their families
all newspapers are pests all even the drapeau blanc
at bottom mar rainville was a jacobin
ah
just heaven
you may boast of having driven your grandfather to despair that you may
that is evident said the odule
and profiting by the fact that m
villa norm and was taking breath the lender added in a magisterial manner there should be no other newspaper than the moniteur and no other book than the annuaire militaire
m
ville form and continued it is like theirs is yes
a regicide ending in a senator for that is the way they always end
they give themselves as far with the address if thou as citizens in order to get themselves called eventually monsieur le comte
monsieur le comte as big as my arm assassins of september
the philosophers if yes
i will do myself the justice to say that i have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers than of the spectacles of the grim addr of tivoli
one day i saw the senator across the quai map plaque high angles of violet velvet down with bees with marsala henri iv
they were hideous
citizens i declare to you that your progress is madness that your humanity is a dream that your revolution is a crime that your republic is a monster that your young and virgin france comes from the brothel and i maintain it against all whoever you may be whether journalists economists of hosts or even were you better judges of liberty of equality and fraternity that the knife of the guillotine
and that i announce to you my fine fellows

cried the lieutenant that is wonderfully true
m
ville norm and paused in a gesture which he had begun wheeled found stared lancer theory of intently in the eyes and said to him you are a book
book sixth
the conjunction of two stars chapter i the sobriquet mode of formation of family names marius was at this epoch a handsome young man of medium stature with thick and intensely black hair a lofty and intelligent grow well opened and passionate nostrils an air of calmness and sincerity and with something indescribably proud thoughtful and innocent over his whole countenance
his profile all of whose lines were rounded without thereby losing their firmness had a certain germanic sweetness which has made its way into the french physiognomy by way of alsace and lorraine and that complete absence of angles which rendered the si cambrex so easily recognizable among the romans and which distinguishes the leonine from the aquiline race
he was at that period of life when the kind of men who think is composed in nearly equal parts of depth and ingenuousness
a grave situation being given he had all that is required to be still done no return of the key and he might be sublime
his manners were reserved cold polished not very genial
as his mouth was charming his lips the reddest and his teeth the whitest in the world his smile corrected the severity of his face as a whole
at certain moments that pure brow and that voluptuous smile presented a singular contrast
his eyes were small but his glance was large
at the period of his most abject misery he had observed that young girls turned round when he passed by and he fled or bid with death in his soul
he thought that they were staring at him because of his old clothes and that they were laughing at them the fact is that they stared at him because of his grace and that they dreamed of jim
this nuts his understanding between him and the pretty passersby had made him why
he chosen one of them for the excellent reason that he fled from all of the h
he loved this indefinitely stupidly a scourge trac said
source year also said to him do not aspire to be venerable they called each other thou it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slip into this mode of address
let me give you a piece of advice my dear fellow
the jades have some good points about the mo marius
by dint of fleeing and blushing you will become brutalized
when source year had addressed to him some remark of this nature marius avoided women both young and old more than ever for a week to come and he avoided court by rac to boot
nevertheless there existed in all the immensity of wreath on two women whom marius did not flee and to whom he paid no attention whatever
in truth he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that they were women
one was the bearded old woman who swept on this chamber and caused source trac to say seeing that his servant woman wears his beard marius does not wear his own beard
the other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very often and whom he never looked at
every time that that chance which needles with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inward sled marius to that walk and it was nearly every day he found this couple there
the man appeared to be about sixty years of age he seemed sad and serious his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service
if he had worn a decoration marius would have said he is an ex officer
he had a kindly but unapproachable air and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one
he wore blue trousers a blue frock coat and abroad brimmed hat which always appeared to be news black cravat a quaker shirt that is to say it was dazzlingly white bit of coarse linen
his hair was very white
the first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted she was a sort of child thirteen or fourteen years of are so thin as to be almost homely awkward insignificant and with a possible promise of handsome eyes
only they were always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance
her dress was both aged and childish like the dress of the scholars in a convent it consisted of a badly cut town of black merino
they had the air of being farmer and daughter
marius scanned this old man who was not yet aged and this little girl who was not yet a person for a few days and thereafter paid no attention to them
they on their side did not appear even to see him
they conversed together with a peaceful and in different air
the girl chartered incessantly and merrily
the old man talked but little and at times he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity
marius has acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk
he invariably found them there
this is the way things went marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from their bench he walked the whole length of the alley passed in front of them then returned to the extremity whence he had come and began again
this he did five or six times in the course of his promenade and the promenade was taken five or six times a week without its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting
that person age and that young girl although they appeared and perhaps because they appeared to shun all glances had naturally caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along the pepin ieee from time to time the studious after their lectures the others after their game of billiards
source trac who was among the last had observed them several times but finding the girl homely he had speedily and carefully kept out of the way
he had fled discharging at them a sobriquet like a parthian cart
the students said ab
monsieur le blanc is on his bench
and marius like the best had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman monsieur le blanc
we shall follow their example and we shall say m
leblanc in order to facilitate this tale
so marius saw them nearly every day at the same hour during the first year
he found the man to his taste but the girl insipid
chapter iii us fact west during the second year precisely at the point in this history which the reader has now reached it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted without marius himself being quite aware why and nearly six months elapsed during which he did not set foot in the alley
one day at last he returned thither once more it was a serene summer morning and marius was in joyous mood as one is when the weather is fine
it seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees
he went straight to his alley and when he reached the end of it be perceived still on the same bench that well known couple
only when he approached it certainly was the same man but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl
the person whom he now be held was a tall and beautiful creature possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenious graces of the child a pure and fugitive moment which can be expressed only by these two words fifteen years
she had wonderful brown hair shared with threads of gold and is that seemed made of marble cheeks that seemed made of road leads lake flush an agitated whiteness an exquisite mouth whence smiles darted like sunbeams and words like music ahead such as raphael would have given to mary set up on an eco that is an goujon would have attributed to a venue
and in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face her nose was not handsome it was pretty neither straight not curved neither italian nor greek it was the parisian nose that is to say spiritual delicate irregular pure which drives painters to despair and charm sports
when marius passed near her he could not see her eyes which were constant lu powered
he saw only her long chestnut pasted permeated with shadow and modesty
this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white haired old man was saying to her and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile combined with those grouping eyes
for a moment marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man a sister of the former no doubt
but when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had examined her attentively he recognized her as the same
in six months the little girl had become a young maiden that was all
nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon
there is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye and become roses all at once
one left them children but yesterday today one finds them disquieting to the feelings
this child had not only grown she had become idealized
as three days in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers six months had sufficed to soothe her with beauty
her april had arrived
one sometimes a few people who poor and mean seem to wake up pass suddenly from indigence to luxury indulge in expenditures of all sorts and become dazzling prodigal magnificent all of a sudden
that is the result of having pocketed an income ago he tells us yesterday
the young girl had received her quarterly income
she wore a dress of black damask scale of the same material and an inner of white grape
her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hand which toyed with the carved chinese ivory handle of a parasol and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot
when one passed near her her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume
as for the man he was the same as usual
the second time that marius approached her the young girl raised her eyelids her eyes were of a deep celestial blue bug in that veiled azure there was as yet nothing but the glance of a child
she looked at marius in differently as she would have stared at the best running beneath the sycamores of the marble vast which cast a shadow on the bench and marius on his side continued his promenade and thought about something else
he passed near the bench where the young girls at five or six times but without even turning his eyes in her direction
on the following day she returned as was his wont to the luxembourg as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no further attention to them
he thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful than he had when she was homely
he passed very near the bench where she sat because such was his habit
chapter iii effect of the spring one day the air was warm the luxembourg was inundated with light and share the sky was as pure as though the angels had washed it that morning the sparrows were giving vent to life pet sitters in the depths of the chestnut trees
marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature he was not thinking of anything he simply lived and breathed he passed near the bench the young girl raised her eyes to him the two glance she t
marius could not have told
there was nothing and there was everything
it was a strange flash
she dropped her eyes and he pursues his way
what he had just seen was no longer the ingenious and simple eye of a child it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened then abruptly closed again
there comes away when the young girl glances in this manner
woe to him who chances to be there
that first gaze of scoop which does not as yet know itself is like the dawn in the sky
it is the awakening of something radiant and strange
nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows and which is composed of all the innocence of the present and of all the passion of the future
it is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance and which waits
it is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself and in which she captures hearts without either wishing or oil digg it
it is a virgin looking like a woman
it is rare that a profound rf very does not spring from that glance where it falls
all purified and all candles meet in that celestial and fatal glean which more than all the best planned tender glances of coquette s possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming in the depths of the soul of that sombre flower impregnated with perfume and with poison which is called love
chapter iv beginning of a great malady on the following day at the accustomed your marius drew from his wardrobe his new coat his new trousers his new hat and his new boots be clothed himself in this complete panoply put on his gloves a tremendous luxury and set off for the luxembourg
on the way thither he encountered source trac and pretended not to see him
he was going to pass an examination no doubt
he looked utterly stupid
on arriving at the luxembourg marius made the four of the fountain basin and stared at the swans then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould and one of whose tips was missing
near the basin there was a bourgeois fifty years of age with a prominent stomach who was holding by the hand a little urchin office and saying to him chun excess my son keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy
marius listened to this bourgeois
then he made the circuit of the basin once more
atlas the directed his course towards his alley slowly and as it with regret
one would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so
he did not perceive it himself and thought that he was doing as he always did
on turning into the wall has a am
leblanc and the young girl at the other end on their bench
he buttoned his coat up to the very top pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles examined with a certain complaisance the lustrous gleams of his trousers and marched on the bench
this march savored of an attack and certainly of a desire for conquest
so i say that he marched on the bench as i should say hannibal marched on rome
however all his movements were purely mechanical and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors
at that moment he was thinking that the manuel du baccalaureate as a stupid book and that it must have been drawn up but are idiots to allow of these tragedies of racine and only one comedy of moliere being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind
there was a piercing whistling going on in his ears
as he approached the bench he held fast to the folds in his coat and fixed his eyes in the young girl
it seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague bluelight
in proportion as he drew near his pace slackened more and more
on arriving at some little distance from the bench and long before he had reached the end of the walk he halted and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps
he did not even say to himself that he would not goes far as the end
it was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance on his new clothes
nevertheless be held himself very erect in case anyone should be looking at him from behind
he attained the opposite end then came back and this time he approached a little nearer to the bench
he even got to within three intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further and he hesitated
but he exerted a manly and violent effort subdued his hesitation and walked straight ahead
a few seconds later he rushed in front of the bench erect and firm reddening to the very ears without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman
at the moment when he passed under the cannon of the place he felt his heartbeat wildly
as on the preceding day she wore her damask gown and her x rape bonnet
he heard an ineffable voice which must have been her voice
she was talking tranquilly
she was very pretty
he felt it although he made no attempt to see her
she could not however he thought help feeling esteem and consideration for me if she only knew that i am the veritable author of the dissertation on marcos obregon de la ronde which m
francois de neufchateau out as though it were his own at the head of his edition of golf las
he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the wall which was very near then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl
this time he was very pale
moreover all his emotions were disagreeable
as he went further from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble
he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halted near the middle of the walk and there a thing which he never did he sat down and reflecting on the most profoundly in distinct depths of his spirit that after all it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour he rose as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole
but he remained standing there motionless
for the first time in fifteen months he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter had on his side noticed him and probably considered his assiduity singular
for the first time also he was conscious of some irreverence in designating that stranger even in his secret thoughts by the sobriquet of m
leblanc
he stood this for several minutes with drooling head trading figures in the sand with the cane which he held in his hand
then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench tom
leblanc and his daughter and went home
that way he forgot to dine
and are a bit of bread
he did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with great care
marius was going out again in his new coat
he went to the luxembourg again but he did not proceed further than his bench his way of the alley
he seated himself the reason the preceding day surveying from a distance and clearly making out the white bonnet the black dress and above all that bluelight
he did not stir from it and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg closed
he did not seem
leblanc and his daughter retire
later on several weeks afterwards when he came to think it over he could never recall where he had dined that evening
marius went out in his new coat
three days in succession
she exclaimed
she tried to follow him but marius walked briskly and with immense strides it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois
she lost sight of him in two minutes and returned breathless three quarters choked with asthma and furious
marius betook himself to the luxembourg
the young girl was there with m
leblanc
marius approached as near as he could pretending to be busy reading a book but he halted afar off then returned and seated himself on his bench where he spent four hours in watching the house sparrows who were skipping about the walk and who produced on him the impression that they were making sport of him
a fortnight passed this
marius went to the luxembourg no longer for the sake of strolling there but to seat himself always in the same spot and that without knowing why
once arrived there he did not stir
he put on his new coat every morning for the purpose of not showing himself and he began all over again on the morrow
she was decidedly a marvellous beauty
the only remark approaching a criticism that could be made was that the contradiction between her gaze which was melancholy and her smile which was merry have a rather wild effect to her face which sometimes caused this sweet countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming
chapter vi taken prisoner on one of the last days of the second week marius was seated on his bench as usual holding in his hand an open book of which he had not turned a page for the last two hours
all at once he started
an event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk
marius closed his book then opened it again then forced himself to read he trembled the aureole was coming straight towards him
ah
good heavens
though the i shall not have time to strike an attitude
still the white haired man and the girl advanced
it seemed to him that this lasted for a century and that it was but a second
what are they coming in this direction for
he asked himself
what
she will pass here
her feet will tread this sand this walk two paces from me
he was utterly upset he would have liked to be very handsome he would have liked to own the cross
he heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps
he imagined that m
leblanc was darting angry glances at him
is that gentleman going to address me
he thought to himself
he dropped his head when he raised it again they were very near him
the young girl passed and as she passed she glanced at him
she gazed steadily at him with a pensive sweetness which thrilled marius from head to foot
it seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed ailing a time to a lapse without coming as far as her and that she was saying to him i am coming myself
marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses
he felt his brain on fire
she had come to him what joy
and then how she had looked at him
she appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet
beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic with a complete beauty which would have made petrarch sing and dante intel
it seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure heavens
at the same time he was horribly vexed because there was due to this boots
he thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots top
he followed her with his eyes until she disappeared
then he started up and walked about the luxembourg garden like a madman
it is possible that at times he laughed to himself and talked aloud
he quitted the luxembourg hoping to find her again in the street
he encountered source head under the arcades of the odeon and said to him come and dine with me
marius are like an ogre
he gave the waiters i ask us
at dessert he said to source trac
have you read the paper
what a fine discourse query depuy rave au delivered
he was desperately in love
after dinner he said to source track will treat you to the list
marius was enormously amused
at the same time he had a redoubled attack of shyness
on emerging from the theatre he refused to look at the garter of a modis he who was stepping across a gutter and source trac who said i should like to put that woman in my collection almost horrified him
source trac invited him to breakfast at the date voltaire on the following morning
marius went thither and are even more than on the preceding evening
he was very thoughtful and very merry
one would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously
he tenderly embraced some major other from the provinces who was presented to him
marius interrupted the discussion to exclaim but it is very agreeable all the same to have the cross
whispered source trac to jean proud aire
it was serious in fact marius had reached that first violent and charming hour with which grand passions begin
a glance had wrought all this
when the mine is charged when the conflagration is ready nothing is more simple
a glance is a spark
it was all over with him
markus loved a woman
his fate was entering the unknown
the glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels which are tranquil in appearance yet formidable
you pass close to them everyday peaceably and with impunity and without a suspicion of anything
a moment arrived when you forget that the thing is there
you go and come dream speak laugh
all at once you feel yourself clutched all is over
the wheels hold you fact the glance has ensnared you
it has caught you no matter where it now by some portion of your thought which was fluttering loose by some distraction which had attacked you
you are lost
the whole of you passes into it
a chain of mysterious forces takes possession of you
you struggle in vain no more human succor is possible
you go on falling from hearing to hearing from agony to agony from torture to torture you your mind your fortune your future your soul and according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature or of a noble heart you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shame or transfigured by passion
chapter vii adventures of the letter u delivered over to conjectures isolation detachment from everything price independence the taste of nature the absence of daily and material activity the life within himself the secret conflicts of chastity a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation had prepared marius for this possession which is called passion
his worship of his father had gradually become a religion and like all religions it had retreated to the depths of his soul
something was required in the foreground
livecam e
a full month elapsed during which marius went every day to the luxembourg
when the hour arrived nothing could hold him back
he is on duty said source trac
marius lived in a state of delight
it is certain that the young girl did look at him
he had finally grown bold and approached the bench
still he did not pass in front of it anymore in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers
he considered it better not to attract the attention of the father
he combined his stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman
sometimes he remained motionless by the half hour together in the shade of a leonidas or a spartacus holding in his hands book above which his eyes gently raised sought the beautiful girl and sue on her side turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile
while conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white haired man she bent upon marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eye
ancient and time honored manoeuvre which eve understood from the very first day of the world and which every woman understands from the very first day of her life
her mouth replied to one and her glance replied to another
it must be supposed that m
leblanc finally noticed something for often when marius arrived he rose and began to walkabout
he had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the gladiator near the other end of the walk as though with the object of seeing whether marius would pursue them thither
marius did not understand and committed this error
the father began to grow in exact and no longer brought his daughter every day
sometimes he came alone
then marius did not stay
another blunted
marius paid no need to these symptoms
from the phase of timidity he had passed by a natural and fatal progress to the phase of blindness
his love increased
he dreamed of it every night
and the man in expects d bliss had happened to him oil on the forward doubling of the shadows over his eyes
one evening at dusk he had found on the bench which m
leblanc and his daughter had just quitted a handkerchief a very simple handkerchief without embroidery but white and fine and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume
he seized it with rapture
this handkerchief was marked with the letters u
f
marius knew nothing about this beautiful child neither her family name her christian name not yet above these two letters were the first thing of her that he had gained possession of adorable initials upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding
i was evidently the christian name
ursule
he thought what a delicious name
he kissed the handkerchief frankly in placed it on his heart in his flesh during the day and at night laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it
i feel that her whole soul lies within it
he exclaimed
this handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman who had simply let it fall from his pocket
in the days which followed the finding of this treasure he only displayed himself at the luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart
the beautiful child understood nothing of all this and signified it to him by imperceptible signs
o modesty
said marius
chapter viii the veterans them selves can be happy since we have pronounced the word modesty and since we conceal nothing we ought to say that once nevertheless in spite of his ecstasies his ursule caused him very serious grief
it was on one of the days when she persuaded m
leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk
a brisk may breeze was blowing which swayed the crests of the plain gain trees
marius had risen to his feet behind them and was following them with his eyes as was fitting in the deep sea he situation of his soul
a leg of exquisite shape appeared
marius saw it
he was exasperated and furious
the young girl had hastily thrust down her dress with a divinely troubled motion but he was nonetheless angry for all that
he was alone in the alley it is true
but there might have been someone there
and what if there had been someone there
can anyone comprehend such a thing
what she had just done is horrible
alas the poor child had done nothing there had been but one culprit the wind but marius in whom quivered the bartholow to exists in cherubim was determined to be vexed and was jealous of his own shadow
it is thus in fact that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart and takes possession of it even without any right
moreover setting aside even that jealousy the sight of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him the white shocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure
when his ursule after having reached the end of the walk retraced her steps with m
leblanc and passed in front of the bench on which marius had seated himself once more marius darted a sullen and ferocious glance at her
the young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement accompanied by a raising of the eyelids which signifies well what is the matter
this was their first quarrel
marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes when someone crossed the walk
it was a veteran very much bent extremely wrinkled and pale in a uniform of the louis xv
marius though the perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air
it even struck him that the aged cynic as he hobbled a long past him addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink as though some chance had created an understanding between them and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together
what did that relic of mars mean by being so contented
what had passed between that wooden leg and the other
marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy
perhaps he was there
he said to himself perhaps he saw
and he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran
with the air of time all points grow full
he finally pardoned her but this cost him a great effort has liked for three days
nevertheless in spite of all this and because of all this his passion augmented and grew to madness
chapter ix eclipse the reader has just seen how marius discovered or thought that jesus covered that she was named ursule
appetite grows with loving
to know that her name was ursule was a great deal it was very little
in three or four weeks marius had devoured this bliss
he wanted another
he wanted to know where she lived
he had committed his first blunder by falling into the ambush of the bench by the gladiator
he had committed a second by notre gaining at the luxembourg when m
leblanc came thither alone
he now committee a third and an immense one
he followed ursule
from that moment forth marius added to his happiness of seeing her at the luxembourg the happiness of following her home
his hunger was increasing
one evening after he had followed them to the it dwelling and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor who has just come in
no replied the porter
he is the gentleman on the third floor
another step gained
this success emboldened marius
on the front
he asked
par bleu
said the porter the house is only built on the street
began marius again
he is a gentleman of property air
a very kind man who does good to the unfortunate though not rich himself
what is his name
resumed marius
the porter raised his head and said are you a police spy air
marius went off quite abashed but delighted
he was getting on
on the following day m
leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the luxembourg they went away while it was still broad daylight
on arriving at the carriage entrance m
leblanc made his daughter pass in first then paused before crossing the threshold and stared intently at marius
on the next day they did not come to the luxembourg
marius waited for them all day in vain
he walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished
the next day no one at the luxembourg
marius waited all day then went and did sentinel duty under their windows
his dinner took care of itself
fever nourishes the sick man and love the liver
he spent a week in this manner
m
leblanc no longer appeared at the luxembourg
marius indulged in melancholy conjecture she dared not watch the ports cochere during the day he contented himself with going at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows
at times he saw shadows foot across them and his heart began to beat
on the eighth day when he arrived under the windows there was no light in them
hello
he said the lamp is not lighted yet
but it is dark
can they have gone out
until midnight
until one in the morning
not a light appeared in the windows of the third story and no one entered the house
he went away in a very gloomy frame of mind
on the morrow to the only existed from morrow tomorrow there was so to speak no today for him on the morrow he found no one at the luxembourg he had expected this
at dusk he went to the house
no light in the windows the shares were drawn the third floor was totally dark
marius tapped at the ports cochere entered and said to the porter the gentleman on the third floor
has moved away replied the porter
marius reeled and said freely how long ago
yesterday
where is he living now
so he has not left his new address
no
and the porter raising his eyes recognized marius
come
said he but you are decidedly a spy then
book seventh
patron minette chapter i mines and miners human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance a third lower floor
the social skills everywhere undermined sometimes for good sometimes for evil
these works are superposed one upon the other
there are superior mines and inferior mines
there is a top and a bottom in this obscure subsoil which sometimes gives way beneath civilization and which our indifference and heedlessness trample underfoot
the encyclopedia in the last century was a mind that was almost open to the sky
the shades those sombre hatchets of primitive christianity only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light
for in the sacred shadows there lies patent light
volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth
every form begins by being night
the catacombs in which the first mass was said were not alone the cellar of rome they were the vaults of the world
beneath the social construction that complicated marvel of a structure there are excavations of all sorts
there is the religious mine the philosophical mine the economic mine the revolutionary mine
such and such a pickaxe with the idea such a pick with ciphers
such another with wrath
people mail and answer each other from one catacomb to another
utopias travel about underground in the pipes
there they branch out in every direction
they sometimes meet and fraternize there
jean jacques lends his pick to diogenes who lends him his lantern
sometimes they enter into combat there
calvin seizes sicinius by the hair
but nothing arrests not interrupts the tension of all these energies toward the goal and the vast simultaneous activity which goes and comes mounts descends and mounts again in these obscurities and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside
society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels
there are as many different subterranean stage was there are varying works as there are extractions
what emerges from these deep excavations
the future
the deeper one goes the more mysterious are the toilets
the work is good up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed lower down it becomes terrible
at a certain depth the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization the limit breathable by man has been passed a beginning of monsters is possible
the descending scale is a strange one and each one of the rungs of this ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold and where one encounters one of these workmen sometimes divine sometimes misshapen
below john huss there is luther below luther there is descartes below descartes there is voltaire below voltaire there is condorcet below condorcet there is robespierre below robes pierre there is mar at below harsh there is babe uf
and so it goes on
lower down confusedly at the limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible one perceives other gloomy men who perhaps do not exist as yet
the men of yesterday are spectres those of tomorrow are forms
the eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely
the embryonic work of the future is one of the visions of philosophy
a world in limbo in the state of foetus what an unheard of spectre
saint simon owen fourier are there also in lateral galleries
surely although a divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves binds together all these subterranean pioneers who almost always think themselves isolated and who are not so their works vary greatly and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others
the first are paradisiacal the last are tragic
nevertheless whatever may be the contrast all these boilers from the highest to the most nocturnal from the wisest to the most foolish possess one likeness and this is it disinterested news
marat forgets to use of like jesus
they throw them selves on one side they omit themselves they think not of themselves
they have a glance and that glance seeks the absolute
the first has the whole heavens in his eyes the last enigmatic although he may be had still beneath his eyelids the pair beam of the infinite
generate the man whoever he may be who has this sign the starry eye
the shadowy eye is the other sign
within evil commences
reflect and tremble in the presence of anyone who has no glance at all
the social order has its black miners
there is a point where depth is tantamount to burial and where light becomes extinct
below all these kinds which we have just mentioned below all these galleries below this whole immense subterranean venous system of progress and utopia much further on in the earth much lower than mar at lower than babe i flower much lower and without any connection with the upper levels there lies the last mime
a formidable colt
this is what we have designated as the petrol sue me dessous
it is the grave of shadows
it is the cellar of the blind
inter k
this communicates with the abyss
chapter ii the lowest depths there disinterested news vanishes
the demon is vaguely outlined each one is for himself
theo in the eyes how is seeks fumbles and gnaws
the social ugolino is in this gulf
the wild spectres who roam in this grave almost beasts almost phantoms are not occupied with universal progress they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires
they are almost unconscious and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration
they have two mothers both stepmothers ignorance and misery
they have a guide necessity and for all forms of satisfaction appetite
they are brutally voracious that is to say ferocious not after the fashion of the tyrant but after the fashion of the tiger
from suffering these spec trespass to crime fatal affiliation dizzy creation logic of darkness
that which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute it is the protest of matter
man there becomes a dragon
to be hungry to be thirsty that is the point of departure to be satan that is the point reached
from that vault laden air e emerges
we have just seen in book fourth one of the compartments of the upper mine of the great political revolutionary and philosophical excavation
there as we have just said all is pure noble dignified honest
there assuredly one might be misled by terror is worthy of veneration there so thoroughly does it imply heroism
the work there effected taken as a whole has a name progress
the moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths hideous depths
there exists beneath society we insist upon this point and there will exist until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated the great cavern of evil
this cavern is below all and is the fog of all
it is barred without exception
this cavern knows no philosophers its dagger has never but a pen
its blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the inkstand
never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling turned the leaves of a book now unfolded a newspaper
babe it is a speculator to cartouche marat is an aristocrat to schinder hannes
this cavern has for its object the destruction of everything
of everything
including the upper superior mines which it exec rates
it not only undermines in or a hideous swarming the actual social order it undermines philosophy it undermines human thought it undermines civilization it undermines revolution it undermines progress
its name is simply the fy prostitution murder assassination
it is darkness and it desires chaos
its vault is formed of ignorance
all the others those above it have but one object to suppress it
it is to this point that philosophy and progress tend with all their organs simultaneously by their amelioration of the real as well as by their contemplation of the absolute
destroy the cavern ignorance and you destroy the lair crime
let us condense in a few words a part of what we have just written
the only social peril is darkness
humanity is identity
all men are made of the same clay
there is no difference here below at least in predestination
the same shadow in front the same flesh in the present the same ashes afterwards
but ignorance mingled with the human paste blackens it
this incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil

gueule her was a hercules of no defined position
for his lair he had the sewer of the arche marion
he was six feet high his pectoral muscles were of marble his biceps of brass his breath was that of a cavern his torso that of a colossus his head that of a bird
one thought one beheld the farnese hercules clad in duck trousers and a cotton velvet waistcoat
gueule her built after this sculptural fashion might have subdued monster she had found it more expeditious to be one
his muscles called for work his stupidity would have none of it
he was a great idle force
he was an assassin through coolness
he was thought to be a creole
he had probably somewhat to do with marshal brune having been a porter at avignon in
after this stage he had turned ruffian
the dial hand it yorba get contrasted with the grossness of gueule mer
banet was thin and learned
he was transparent but impenetrable
daylight was visible through his bones but nothing through his eyes
he declared that he was a chemist
he had been a jack of all trades
he had played in vaudeville at saint mihiel
he was a man of purpose at installer who underlined his smiles and accentuated his gestures
his occupation consisted in selling in the open air plaster busts and portraits of the head of the state
in addition to this be extracted teeth
he had exhibited phenomena affairs and he had owned a booth with a trumpet and this poster babe t dental artist member of the academies makes physical experiments on metals and metalloids extracts teeth undertake a stumps abandoned by his brother practitioners

this take advantage of this opportunity meant have as many teeth extracted as possible
he had been married and had had children
he did not know what had become of his wife and children
he had lost them as one loses his handkerchief
babe tread the papers a striking exception in the air is to which he belonged
my wife has not the air to present me with a child like that
later on he had abandoned everything in order to undertake paris
this was his expression
who was clashes ous
he was right
he waited until the sky was daybed with black before he showed himself
at nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before daylight
where was this hole
no one knew
he only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness and with his back turned to them
was his name claw keep us
certainly not
if a candle was brought he put on a mask
he was a ventriloquist
banet sa is claque sous is a nocturne for two voices
clashes ous was vague terrible and a roamer
no one was sure whether he had a name clashes ous being a sobriquet no new assure that he had a voice as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice no one was sure that he had a face as he was never seen without his mask
he disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air when he appeared it was as though he sprang from the earth
a lugubrious being was montparnasse
montparnasse was a child less than twenty years of age with a handsome face lips like she tries charming black hair the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes he had all vices and aspired to all crimes
the digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse
it was the street boy turned pickpocket and a pick pocket turned garrote r
he was genteel effeminate graceful robust sluggish ferocious
the rim of his hat was curled up on the left side in order to make room for a tuft of hair after the style of
he lived by robbery with cum pence
his coat was of the best cut but threadbare
montparnasse was a fashion plate in misery and given to the commission of murders
the first grise the who had said to him you are handsome
had cast the stain of darkness into his heart and had made a cain of this abel
finding that he was handsome he desired to be elegant now the height of elegance is idleness idleness in a poor man means crime
few prowlers were so dreaded as montparnasse
at eighteen he had already numerous corpses in his past
more than one passerby lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch with his face in a pool of blood
curled pomade d with laced waist the hips of a woman the bust of a prussian officer the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him his cravat knowingly tied a bludgeon in his pockets flower in his buttonhole such was this fancy of the sepulchre
these four men were not four men they were a sort of mysterious robber with four heads operating on a grand scale in paris they were that monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society
thanks to their ramifications and to the network underlying their relations vsnet the uk diet clashes ous and montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise of the ambushes of the department of the seine
the inventors of ideas of that nature men with nocturnal imaginations applied to them to have their ideas executed
they furnished the canvas to the four rascals and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery
they labored at the stage setting
they were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder and which were sufficiently lucrative
when a crime was in quest of arms they under let their accomplices
they kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies
they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they woke up on the plains which adjoin the salpetriere
there they held their conferences
they had twelve black hours before them they regulated their employment accordingly
patron minette such was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation in the association of these four men
in the fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day patron minette signifies the morning the same as entre chiens tip up between dog and do it signifies the evening
this appellation patron minette was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians
these four men were known under this title
when the president of the assizes visited laden site in his prison and questioned him concerning a misdeed which laden air e denied who did it
demanded the president
lace naked made this response enigmatical so far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police perhaps it was patron ninette
a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it
here are the appellations to which the principal members of patron minette answered for the names have survived in special memoirs

we pass over some and not the worst of them
these names have faces attached
they do not express merely being shut species
each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the underside of civilization
those beings who were not very lavish with their countenances were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets
ratified by the wild nights which they passed they went off by day to sleep sometimes in the limekilns sometimes in the abandoned quarries of montmarte or montrouge sometimes in the sewers
they ran to earth
what became of these men
they still exist
they have always existed
horace speaks of the mahbub alarum collegia pharmaco polar mendicino mae and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what they are
beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually born again from the social ooze
they return spectres but always identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins
the individuals extirpated the tribe subsists
they always have the same faculties
from the vagrant to the tramp the race is main gained in its purity
they did in courses in pockets they scent out watches info be
gold and silver possess an odor for them
there exist ingenuous bourgeois of whom it might be said that they have a steal able air
these men patiently pursue these bourgeois
they experience the slivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger or of a man from the country
these men are terrible when one encounters the mod catches a glimpse of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard
they do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in nowise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of loving for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the night
what is necessary to cause these spectres to vanish
light
light in floods
not a single bat can resist the dawn

book eighth
the wicked poor man chapter i marius while seeking a girl in a bonnet encounters a man in a cap summer passed then the autumn winter came
neither m
leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden
thenceforth marius had but one thought to gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face
he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found nothing
he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm resolute seven than the bold defied of date the brain which erected future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects with pride with ideas and wishes he was a list dog
he fell into a black melancholy
all wa cover
work disgusted him walking hired him
fast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsels perspectives horizons teachings bowl an empty before him
it seemed to him that everything had disappeared
he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise by the no longer took loews urs in his though us
to everything that they proposed to him in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use
he healed a hundred reproaches on himself
why did i follow her
i was so happy at the mere sight of her
she looked at me was not that immense
she had the air of loving me
was not that everything
i wished to have what
there was nothing after that
i have been absurd
it is my own fault etc
etc
source trac to whom he confided nothing it was his nature but who made some little guess at everything that was his nature has begun by congratulating him on being in love though he was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state he ended by saying to him i see that you have been simply an animal
here come to the shaun ieee
once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed himself to be taken to the falls reseaux by source head bossuet and grant site hoping what a dream
that he might perhaps find her there
of course he did not see the one he sought
but this is the place all the same where all post women are found grumbled grant site in an aside
marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on food alone through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes stunned by the noise and dust of the merry wagons filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to him send in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut trees along the road in order to refresh his head
he took to losing more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love
on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect
he met in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a working man and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white hair
marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation
strange to say he thought that he recognized m
leblanc
the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cao permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed
what was the meaning of this
what signified that disguise
marius was greatly astonished
when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking
in any case he must see the man near at hand and clear up the mystery
but the idea occurred to him too late the man was no longer there
he had turned into some little side street and marius could not find him
this encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced
after all he said to himself it was probably only a resemblance
chapter ii treasure trove marius had not left the goffeau house
he paid no attention to anyone there
at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the house except himself and those kind rettes whose rent he had once paid without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or daughters
the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been turned out in default of payment
marius mary had emerged from his night was failing
it was the hour for his dinner for he has been obliged to take to dining again alas
oh infirmities of ideal passions
everything is dead
there is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world
marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue saint jacques
he was walking along with dropping head
all at once he felt someone elbow him in the disk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the install and slim the other a little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed
through the twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats and their bare feet
they were talking as the tran
the taller said in a very low voice the bobbies have come
they came near nagging me at the half circle
the other answered i saw them
i bolted bolted bolted
through this repulsive slang marius understood that gendarmes of the police had come near apprehending these two children and that the latter had escaped
they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot then disappeared
markus had halted for a moment
he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet
he stooped and picked it up
it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers
good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it
he retraced his steps he called he did not find them he reflected that they just already be far away put the package in his pocket and went off to dine
the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind
poor mothers
he thought
then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations
he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg
how gloomy my life has become
he said to himself
young girls are always appearing time only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls
chapter iii quadri frogs that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to bed his hand came in contacting me pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard
he had forgotten of
he thought that it would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it
he opened the envelope
it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed
they bore addresses
all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco
the first was addressed to law and madame la marquise de geus her at the place opposite the chamber of deputies no
marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety
it was conceived as follows madame la marquise the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely united society
turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion on this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood consecrated his fortune ev very thing to defend that cause and today finds himself in the greatest miss egy
he doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence water emely painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance on the humanity which animated you and on the interest which madame la marquise bears to a nation so unfortunate
their prayer will not be in vain and their gratitude will preserve the irs charming souvenir
my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be madame donald area spanish captain of cavalry a royalist who has take refuge in france who finds himself on travel is for his country and the resources are lacking him to continue his travails
no address was joined to the signature
marius hoped to find the address in the second letter whose superscription read a madame madame la comtesse de bont verne true cassette no
this is what markus read in it madame la comtesse it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old
icici since my last confinements can fined by my husband five months ago haveing no resources in the world the most frightful in finance
in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect mistress ba lizard
marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the preceding he read monsieur labour grote left or wholesale sticking merchant rue saint denis on the corner of the ruraux fees
i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pre tious favor of your simla ties and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the theatre francais
the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have some merit
there are couplets to be sung in four places
the comic the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds listed loudly and ends after striking altar ations in the midst of many beautiful strokes of brilliant scene c
my principal object is to say is to the desire which progressively animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion that capri tious and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind
in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy the egotism if priviliged authors may obtain e my exclusion from the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortifications with which newcomers are treated
monsour go about felt your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters emboldens me to send you my daughter who will explain our indig any situation to you lacking bread and fire in this wynter season
when i say to you that i beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection and of adorning my writings with your name
if you deign to honor me with the most modest offering i shall immediately occupy myself in making a piesse of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude
which i shall endeavor to render this piece was perfect as possible will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage
to monsieur and madame osbourne of my most respectful complements gentoo that of letters
l
s
even if it is only forty sous
excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself but saw motives connected with the toilet do not permit me alas
to go out
finally marius opened the fourth letter
the address ran to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques du haut pas
it contained the following lines benevolent man if you deign to accompany my daughter you will be hold a missed able calamity and i will show you my certificates
at the aspect of these writings your generous soul will be moved with a sentiment of obvious benevolence for true philosophers always feel lively emotions
admit compassionate man that it is necessary to suffer the most cruel need and that it is very painful for the sake of obtaining a little relief to get oneself attested by the authorities as though one were not free to suffer and to die of in a motion while waiting to have our misery relieved
destinies are very fatal for several and top prodigal or too protecting for others
i await your presence of your offering if you deign to make one and i beseech you to accept the respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be truly magnanimous many our very humble and very obedient servant p
fagan you dramatic artist
after per using these four letters marius did not find himself much further advanced than before
in the first place not one of the signers gave his address
then they seemed to come from four different individuals donal vegas mistress ball z add the poet ten foot and dramatic artist fagan you but the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written by the same hand
what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come from the same person
moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four theodor of tobacco was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the style the same orthographical faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity and the labor letters ten foot was no more exempt from them than the spanish captain
it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery
had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a just ification
marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him
nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius has met on the boulevard
after all they were evidently papers of no value
marius replaced them in their envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to bed
as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work
even when absent he left his key in the lock
of what
said marius
there came a second knock as gentle as the first
come in said marius
the door opened
asked marius without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts in his table
marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl
chapter iv abode in misery illustration rose in misery brose in misery a very young girl was standing in the half open door
the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figured it has an light
she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness
her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemises blond and lymphatic pallor earth colored collarbones red hands a half open and degraded mouth missing teeth full bold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corgi of old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep
marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams
the most heartbreaking thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely
in her early childhood chemist even have been pretty
the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty
that face was not wholly unknown to marius
he thought here he mb free having seen it somewhere
what do you wish mademoiselle
he asked
the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict here is a letter for you monsieur marius
she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl
how did she know his name
without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered
she entered resolutely sharing with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the un made bed
her feet were base
large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her think news
she was shivering
she held a letter other hand which she presented to marius
marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist
the message could not have come from a distance
he read my amiable neighbor young man i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid by rent six months ago
i bless you youngman
my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill
if i am not des saved in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by dairying to lavish on me a slight favor
i am with the dust in guished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity jon dee the
p
s
my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius
all was suddenly illuminated
this letter came from the same place as the other four
there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco
there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signed
the spanish captain ron alvarez the unhappy mistress balls are the dramatic post ten foot the old comedian fagan you were all four names jon dee their indeed jon dee the himself were named monde free
marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors
his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also
he had been obliged more than once to pass them on fretted in the corridor or on the stairs but they were mr reforms to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jon dee the girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere
now he saw everything clearly
he understood that his neighbor jon dee the in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compare iovate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had come to such a pass that he risked his daughter she was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake
marius understood that probably judging from their flight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures we replying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls hot women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery
sad creatures without name or sexo rate to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility
souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faced today like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of more while waiting for some wheel to crush them
nevertheless while marius bent a pained and astonish cd gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the target with the audacity of a spectre
she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness
occasionally her chemise which was untied and horn fell almost to her waist
hullo
said she you have a mirror
and she hummer scraps of vaudeville was though she had been alone frolicsome refrains which had hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious
an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood
effrontery is a disgrace
nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak to it with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing
one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and over free mien if this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming
never even among animals does the creature born to be adobe change into an osprey
that is only to be seen among men
marius reflected and allowed her to have her way
she approached the table
ah
said she books
a flash pierced her glassy eye
she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible i know how to read ido
she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the tank rand read with tolerable fluency general nauru in received orders to take the chateau if you go mont which stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalions of his brigade
she paused
ah
waterloo
i know about that
it was a battle long ago
my father was there
my father has served in the armies
we are fine bonap artists in our house that we are
waterloo was against the english
she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed and i know how to write top
she sipped her pen in the ink and turning to marius do you want to see
and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper which lay in the middle of the table the hobbies are here
then throwing down the pen there are no faults of orthography
you can look
we have received an education my sister and i
we have not always been as we are now
we were not made here she paused fixed her full eyes on marius and burst out laughing saying with an intonation which contained every form of anguish stifled by every form of cynicism bag
i am hungry father
padded ricoh
i have no food
i am cold mother

i have no clothes

had quit
she had hardly finished this coupler when she exclaimed do you ever go to the play monsieur marius
i do
i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets sometimes
one is cramped and uncomfortable there
there are rough people there sometimes and people who smell bad
then she scrutinized marius assumed a singular air and said do you know mg
markus that you are a very handsome fellow
and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both and made her smile and him blush
she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder you pay no need to me but i know you md
marius
i meet you here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named fathermag eur who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter
it is very be coming to you to have your hair tumbled this
she tried to render her voice soft not only succeeded in making it very deep
a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing
marius had retreated gently
mademoiselle said he with his cook gravity i have here a package which belongs to you i think
permit me to return it to you
and he held out the envelope containing the four letters
she slapped her hands and exclaimed we have been looking everywhere for that
then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope saying as she did so dieu de dieu
how my sister and i have hunted
and it was you who found it
on the boulevard was it not
it must have been on the boulevard
you see we let it fall when we were running
it was that beat of a sister of mine who was so stupid
when we got home we could not find it anywhere
and how did you find out that they belonged to me
ah
yes the writing
so it was you that we jostled as we passed last night
here
said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass
by the way this is his home
perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on
then she began to laugh again and added do you know what it will mean if we get a breakfast today
it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our breakfast of yesterday our dinner of today and all that at once and this morning
come
par bleu
if you are not satisfied dogs burst
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there
i often go off in the evening
last winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges
we huddled together to keep from freezing
my little sister cried
how melancholy the water is
i think people are clinging stones at me if lee without knowing a higher everything whorls and whirls
you feel very queer when you have had no good
and then she stared at him with a bewildered air
by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets markus had finally collected five france sixteen sous
this was all he owned in the world for the moment
at all events he thought there is my dinner for today and tomorrow we will see
he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five france to the young girl
she seized the coin
good
said she the sun is shining
and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain she went on five france
the shiner
a monarch
in this hole
bravo for the good fellows
and meat
and stew
and a good tool
she pulled her chemise upon her shoulders made a low how to marius then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying good morning air
it breaks my teeth
then she departed
chapter va provide n goal peephole markus had lived for five years in poverty in restitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery
true misery he had but just had a view of
it was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes
in fact he who has only be held the misery of man has seen nothing the misery of woman is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child
when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last resources at the same time
woe to the defenceless beings who surround him
world ages bread for e courage goodwill all daily in simultaneously
the light of day seems extinguished without the moral light within in these shadows man encounters the new bidness of the woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy
then all horrors become possible
despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open in either vic for crime
health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated in sinister wide by that fumbling which seeks resources which encounters opprobrium and which accommodates itself to it
fathers mothers children brothers sisters men women daughters ad here and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky promiscuous news or sexes relationships ages in gamies and innocence s
they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of date
they exchange woebegone glances
on the unfortunate wretched
how pale they are
how cold they are
it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours
this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows
she revealed to him a hideous side of the night
marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revert and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day
the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement which anyone would have yielded to by the marius should have done better than that
what
only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived groping it in the dark outside the isle of the rest of the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or rather cattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no need to them
every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even lend a near
and geo and lay in those words and he did not even listen to then his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dream who impossible radiance who lives in the air to fillies and all the whole human creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people were agonizing in vain beside him
he even formed a part of their misfortune and he aggravated in
for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable man evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold of and rescued
they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no doubt very vii every odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single words fatal word the miserable whose fault is this
and then should not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great
while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which separated him from the job fretted as though he were able to make his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people
the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished
only a hamas dreamy as marius could have failed to perceive this long before
there was no paper pasted on the wall either on the side of the hon dr effexor in that of marius the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness
marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes revert examines observes and scrutinize was thought would
all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceilings triangular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes
commiseration has and should have its curiosity
this aperture formed a sort of peephole
it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it
let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought markus and in what condition they are
he climbed up on the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked
chapter vi the wild man in his lair cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves
only in cities that which this conceals itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful
caverns are better than novels
what marius now be held was a novel
marius was poor and his chamber was poverty stricken but as his poverty was noble his target was neat
the den up in which his eye now tested was an next fifty fetid pestiferous means or die
through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom
the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a visage disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded from them
obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them
the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled not planked its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the novel which had grown black under the long continued pressure of feet
upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly incrusted and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes socks and repulsive tags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty frances year
there was every sort of thing in that fireplaces brazier a lot broken boards days suspended from nails a bird cage ashes and even a little fire
two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way
one thing which added still more to the horrors of this target was that it was large
it had projections and angles and black holes the lower sides of roofs bays and promontories
some monstrous human beings must be hiding
one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window
one end of each touched the fireplace and faded marius
in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription the dream
it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the fall of a frame probably showing a rain on the other side of some pier glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to get stung
near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and lakers at a man about sixty years of age small think i did haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel
if lavater had studied this view gets would have found the culture mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pettifor get rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the pet to forget making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the pettifor get horrible
this man had a long gray beard
beneath this chemise buddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible
he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking
there was no bread in the novel but there was still tobacco
he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had read
on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique mood reading rooms betrayed a romance
on the cover sprawled the following title printed in large capital show the king honor and the ladies by duc gay cum in il
as the man wrote he talked a loud and marius heard his words the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead
just look at pere lachaise
the great those who are rich are up above in the acacia alley which is paved
they can reach it in a carriage
the little people the poor the unhappy well what of them
they are put down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places
they are out there so that they will decay the sooner
you can not go to see them without sinking into the earth
he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground his teeth on
i could eat the whole world
a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace other bar wheels
she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth
a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat
although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature
she was a sort of giant beside her husband
she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails
beside her in the floor wide open lay a book of the same form as the other and probably a volume of the same romance
on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening ordering of living
no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age
on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen
she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted
she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time then suddenly starts up rapidly
it is indigence which produces these melancholy human plants
these creatures have neither childhood not youth
at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen they seem twenty
today a little girl tomorrow a woman
one might say that they strive through life in order to get through with it the more speedily
at this moment this being had the air of a child
moreover no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft no spinning wheel got a tool
in one corner lay some ironmongery of dubious aspect
it was the full listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony
marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior more terrifying than the interior of a tomb for the human soul could be felt fluttering there and life was palpitating there
they are at the cellar the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber but as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of their palaces it seems that death which stands directly side by side with them places its greatest miseries in that vestibule
the man held his peace the woman spoke no word the young girl did not even seem to breathe
the scratching of the pen on the paper was audible
the man grumbled without pausing in his writing
ca taille
canal old
everybody is can wille
calm yourself my little friends he said
you are too good to write to all those people husband
bodies press close to eachother in misery as in cold but hearts draw a part
this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging from the amount of love within her but probably in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group this has become extinct
there no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband
nevertheless caressing appellations had survived as is often the case
she called him my dear my little friend my goodman etc
with her mouth while her heart was silent
the man resumes his writing
chapter vii strategy and tactics markus with a loss upon his breast was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post
the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly
the eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold
marius had not seen it in her an hour previously but she had probably deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity and had picked it up again on emerging
she entered pushed the door to behind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy he is coming
the father hot new his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the little sister did not stir
who
demanded her father
the gentleman
the philanthropist
yes
from the church of saint jacques
yes
that old fellow
yes
and he is coming
he is following me
you are sure
i am sure
there truly he is coming
he is coming in a fiacre

he is rothschild
the father rose
how are you sure
if he is coming in a fiacre now is it that you arrive before him
you gave him out address at least
did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor on the right
if he only does not make a mistake
so you found him at the church
did he read my letter
what did he say to you
ta ta ta said the girl how you do gallop on my goodman
i certainly did tell him the last foot in the corridor on the right
and what makes you think that he will come
i have just seen the fiacre turn into the rue petit gam quiet
that is what made me runs o
how do you know that it was the same fiacre
because i took notice of the numbers others
what was the number
good you are a clever girl
i prefer to go barefoot
one can not go barefoot to the good god he added bitterly
then returning to the subject which absorbed him so you are sure that he will come
he is following on my heels said she
the man started up
a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance
wife
he exclaimed you hear
here is the philanthropist
extinguish the fire
the stupefied mother did not stir
the father with the ability of an acrobat seized a broken nose dj in which stood on the chimney and flung the water on the brands
then addressing his eldest daughter here you
pull the straw off that chair
his daughter did not understand
he seized the chair and with one kick be rendered its eat less
his leg passed through it
as he withdrew his leg he asked his daughter is it cold
very cold
it is snowing
the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window and shouted to her in a thundering voice quick
get off that bed you last thing
will you never do anything
breaks page of glass
the little girl jumped off the bed with a shiver
breaks page
he repeated
the child stood still in bewilderment
do you hear me
repeated her father i tell you to break a page
the child with a sort of certified obedience rose on tiptoe and struck a page with her fist
the glass broke and fell with a loud clatter
good said the father
he was grave and abrupt
his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garret
one would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning
the mother who had not said a word so far now rise and demanded in a full slow languid voice whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state what do you mean to do my dear
get into bed replied the man
his intonation admitted or no deliberation
the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets
in the meantime as if became audible in one corner
cried the father
the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fiat without quitting the corner in which she was cowering
what follows you commit
she has cut herself breaking that page for you
so much the better
said the man
i foresaw that
what
so much the better
retorted his wife
peace
replied the father i suppress the liberty of the press
that done his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his horn chemise
and the chemise too said he this has a good appearance
an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room
the outermost penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers
through the broken pane the snow could be seen falling
the snow promised by the candlemas fun of the preceding day had actually done
the father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing
he seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to entirely conceal them
then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney piece now said he we can receive the philanthropist
feel how cold i am said she
bah
replied the father i am much colder than that
the mother exclaimed impetuously you always have something better than anyone else so you do
even bad things
down with you
said the man
the mother being eyed after a certain fashion held her tongue
silence reigned for a moment in the hotel
no
exclaimed the father quite the contrary
son
son
then turning to the elder there now
he is not coming
what if he were not to come
i shall have extinguished my fire wrecked my chair torn my shirt and broken my page ali for nothing
and wounded the child
murmured the mother
what if that man should not come
in
see there you
he makes us wait
they will wait for me
how i hate them and with what you jubilation enthusiasm and satisfaction i could strangle all those rich folks
all those rich folks
old dude that are not worth four sous
and bread
ah
money
never
because they say that we would go off and drink it up and that we are drunkards and idlers
and they
what are they then and what have they been in their time
thieves
they never could have become rich otherwise
ph
society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed onto the sir all of it
it would all be smashed very likely but at least no one would have anything and there would be that much gained
but what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing
will become
perhaps the animal has forgo then the address
deign to enter most respected benefactor and your charming young lady also
a man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the threshold of the attic
marius had not quitted his post
his feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue
it was she
whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that words me
it was certainly aye
marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor which has suddenly spread before his eyes
it was that sweet absent being that star which has beamed upon him for six months it was those eyes that growth at mouth that love it vanished face which had created night by its departure
the vision has been eclipsed now it reappeared
it reappeared in that gloom in that garreton that misshapen attic in all that horror
marius shuddered in dismay
what
it was she
the palpitations of his heart troubled his sight
he felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears
what
he beheld her again at last after having sought her so long
it seemed to him that he had lost his soul and that he had just found it again
she was the same as ever only a little pale her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet her figure was concealed beneath spells self black satin
beneath her long dress a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot show in a silken boot
she was still accompanied by m
leblanc
she had taken a few steps into the room and had deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table
the eldest jon dee the girl had retired behind the door and was staring with sombre eyes at that velvet bonnet that will mantle and that charming happy face
chapter ix jon dee the comes near weeping the novel was so dark that people coming from without felton entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar
the two newcomers advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able to distinguish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the garret who were accustomed to this twilight
m
leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to non frette the father monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets
our angelic benefactor overwhelms is said jon dee the bowing to the very earth
then bending down to the war of his eldest daughter while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in a low and rapid voice hey
what did i say
duds
no money
they are all alike
by the way how was the letter to that old blockhead signed
fagan you replied the girl
the dramatic artist good
it was lucky for non frente that this has occurred to him for at the very moment m
leblanc turned to him and said to him with the air of a person who is seeking to recall and me i see that you are greatly to be pitied monsieur fagan you replied jon dee the quickly
monsieur fagan routes that is it
i remember
dramatic artists it and one who has had some success
here jon dee the evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the philanthropist
he exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mountebank affairs and the humility of the mendicant on the highway a pupil of talks
sir
i am a pupil of talks
fortune formerly smiled on meal as
you see my benefactor no bread no fire
my poor babes have no fire
my only chair has no seat
a broken page
and in such weather
my spouse in bed

poor woman
salem
leblanc
my child wounded
add edmond tette
the child diverted by the arrival of the strangers had fallen to contemplating the young lady and had ceased to sob
cry
baal
said jon frette to her in a low voice
at the same time he punched her sore hand
all this was done with the talent of a juggler
the little girl gave vent to loud shrieks
the adorable young girl whom marius in his heart called his ursule approached her hastily
poor dear child
said she
you see my beautiful young lady pursued yonder the her bleeding wrist
it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sousa day
it may be necessary to cut off her arm
really
said the old gentleman in alarm
the little girl taking this seriously fell to sobbing more violently than ever
alas
yes my benefactor
replied the father
for several minutes yonder the had been scrutinizing the benefactor in a singular fashion
as he spoke he seemed to be examining the other attentively as though seeking to summon up his recollections
all at once profiting by a moment when the newcomers were questioning the child with interest as to her injured hand he passed near his wife who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air and said to begin a rapid but very low tone take a look at that man
then turning tom

the resid
i owe for four quarters a whole year
that is to say sixth franca
jon dee the lied
four quarters would have amounted to only forty franca and he could not owe four because six months had not elapsed since marius had paid for two
m
leblanc drew five france from his pocket and threw them on the table
yonder the found time to mutter in the war of his eldest daughter the scoundrel
what does he think i can do with his five france
in the meanwhile m
leblanc had removed the large brown great coat which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the chair
monsieur fagan you he said these five brands are all that i have about me but i shall now take my daughter home and i will return this evening it is this evening that you must pay is it not
he replied vivaciously yes respected air
i will be here at six and i will fetch you the sixty france
my benefactor
exclaimed jon dee the overwhelmed
and he added in a low bone take a good look at him site
m
leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had turned towards the door
farewell until this evening my friends
said he
said jon dee the
at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder jon dee the girl
you are forgetting your coatsie said she
jon fretted after an annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders
m
leblanc turned back and said with a smile i have not forgotten it i am leaving it
o my protector
said jim frette my august benefactor i melt into tears
permit me to accompany you to your carriage
if you come out answered m
leblanc put on this coat
it really is very cold
jon frette did not need to be told twice
he hastily donned the brown greatcoat
and all three went out jon dee the preceding the two strangers
chapters tariff of licensed cabs two france an hour marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing
his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that garret
during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitated the whole soul on a single point
he contemplated not that girl but that light which does a satin of lisse and a velvet bonnet
the star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any more dazzled
while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words
he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form her walk he did not know the sound of her voice
he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact
he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might bear away in missoula little of that music
but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclam at home and trumpet bursts of jon dee the
he devoured her with his eyes
he could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those file creatures in that monstrous lair
it seemed to him that he beheld a hummingbird in the midst of roads
when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously rediscovered her
he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat
as he laid his hand on the lick of the door and was on the point of opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause
the corridor was long the staircase steep monde et he was talkative m
leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage icon turning round in the corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final
what was metodo
should be wait a little
but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off
marius was perplexed
atlas the accepted the risk and quitted his room
there was no one in the corridor
he hastened to the stairs
there was no one on the staircase
he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see aflac returning the corner of the rue du petit ban quiet on its way back to paris
marius rushed headlong in that direction
on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fiacre again rapidly descending the rue mouffetard the carriage was already a long way off and there was no means of overtaking it what
run after it
impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly notice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiacre and the father would recognize him
at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck marius perceived an empty can passing along the boulevard
there was but one thing to be done to jump into this car and follow the fiacre
that was sure efficacious and free from danger
marius made the drivers sign to halt and called to him by the hour
markus wore no cravat he had on his working coat which was destitute of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plants on the bosom
the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb
what is it
said marius
pay in advance said the coachman
marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him
how much
he demanded
for the ous
i will pay only return
markus stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air
for the lack of four and twenty sludge was losing his joy his happiness his love
he had seen and he was becoming blind again
he reflected bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five francs which he had bestowed that very morning on that miserable girl
if he had had those five grand she would have been saved he would have been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed state he might have re knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant once more
he returned to his novel in despair
he might have told himself that m
leblanc had promised to return in the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully so that he might follow him on that occasion but in his contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this
these two men standing there motionless and in conversation in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed
still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom monde et he was talking resembled a certain land may call a spring an ideal is a big ten all of whom court eur act as once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer
this land may dallas print an ideal is a big demaille figured later on in many criminal trials and became a notorious rascal
he was at that time only a famous rascal
today he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins
he was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign
and in the evening at nightfall at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers he was discussed at la force in the god sexual konz
one might even in that prison precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape in broad daylight of thirty prisoners in passes under the culvert read his name own chair audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer during one of his attempts at flight
in the police already had their eye on him but he had not as yet have a serious beginning
chapter vi offers of service from misery to wretchedness marius ascended the stairs of the novel with slow steps at the moment when he was about to reenter his cell he caught sight of the elder jon dee the girl following him through the corridor
the very sight of this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was too late to demand them back the cab was no longer there the fiacre was far away
moreover she would not have given them back
as for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the letter signed rabah you had been addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques duh auto as
markus entered his room and pushed the door to after him
it did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open
what is it
he asked who is there
it was the jon dee the girl
is if you
resumed marius almost harshly still you
what do you want with me
she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him
she no longer had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning
she did not enter but held back in the darkness of the corridor where marius could see her through the half open door
come now will you answer
cried marius
what do you want with me
she raised her full eyes in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely and said monsieur marius you look sad
what is the matter with you
with me
said marika
yes you
there is nothing the matter with me
yes there is
no
i tell you there is
let me alone
marine gave the door another push but she regained her hold on it
stop said she you are in the wrong
although you are not rich you were kind this morning
be so again now
you gave me something today now tell me what ails you
you are grieved that i domain
i do not want you to be grieved
what can be done for it
can one of any service
employme
i do not ask for your secrets you need not tell them to me but i may be of use nevertheless
i may be able to help you since i tell my father
when it is necessary to carry letters to go to houses to inquire from door to door to find out an address to follow any one i am of service
sell you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you and i will go and speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if someone speaks to the persons that suffices to let them understand matters and everything comes right
make use of me
what branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling
he drew near to the jon dee the girl
listen he said to her
she interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes
oh yes do call me thou
i like that better
well he resumed thou hast brought higher that old gentleman and his daughter
yes
dost thou know their address
no
find it for me
is that what you want
she demanded
yes
do you know them
no
that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know her but you wish to know her
this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it
well can you do it
said marius
there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled marius
he resumed never mind after all the address of the father and daughter
their address indeed
she gazed fixedly at him
what will you give me
anything you like
anything i like
yes
you shall have the address
she dropped her head then with an risque movement she pulled to the door which closed behind her
marius found himself alone
he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp and as though a prey to vertigo
all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his brain confusedly
all at once he was violently aroused from his revert
he heard the shrill hard voice of jon dee the utter these words which were fraught with a strange interest for him i tell you that i am sure if it and that i recognized him
of whom was jon dee the speaking
whom had he recognized
m
leblanc
the father of his ursule
what
did jon dee the know him
was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark go min
as she about to learn at last who it was that he loved who that young girl was
who her father was
was the dense shadow which enwrapped them on the point of being dispelled
was the veil about to be rent
ah
heavens
he founded rather than climbed up on his commode and resumed his post near the little peep hole in the partition wall
chapter xii the use made of m
two new blankets were thrown across the two beds
monde et de had evidently just returned
he still had the breathlessness of out of doors
his wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative of astonishment
hon dr byte was pacing up and down the garret with long strides
his eyes were extraordinary
the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband turned to say what really
you are sure
surf
eight years have passed
but i recognize him
ah
i recognize him
i knew him at once
what
no
he is better dressed that is all
ah
he paused and said to his daughters get out of here you
they arose to obey
the mother stammered with her injured hand
the air will do it good said jon dee the
geoff
it was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one offers to reply
the two girls departed
but not you
i shall need you
marius redoubled his attention
on being left alone with his wife jon deer he began to pave the room again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence
all at once he turned to the female jon dee the folded his arms and exclaimed and would you like to have me tell you something
the young lady well what
retorted his wife the young lady
marius could not doubt that it was really age of whom they were speaking
he listened with ardent anxiety
his whole life was in his ears
but you frette had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper
then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud it issue
that one
said his wife
that very ones and the husband
surprise rate hate wrath were mingled and combined on one monstrous intonation
the pronunciation of a few words the name no doubt which her husband had whispered in her ear has sufficed to rouse this huge somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible
it is not possible
she cried
when i think that my daughters are going barefoot and have not shown to their backs
what
so that one would think she was a lady
no you are mistaken
why in the first place the other was hideous and this one is not so bad looking
she really is not bad looking
i tell you that it issue
you will see
at this absolute assertion the jon dee the woman raised her large red blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression
at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her husband
she was a cow with the look of a tigress
what
she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who gazed at my daughters with an air of pity she is that beggar brad
oh
i should like to kick her stomach informer
she sprang off of the bed and remained standing for a moment her hair in disorder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists clenched and drawn back
then she fell back on the bed once more
the man paced to and friend paid no attention to his female
after a silence lasting several minutes he approached the female jon frette and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done a moment before and shall i tell you another thing
what is it
she asked
he answered in a low curt voice my fortune is made
the women stared at him with the look that signifies is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad
he went on thunder
it was not so very long ago that i was a parishioner of the parish of die of hunger if you have a fire die of cold if you have bread
i have had enough of misery
no more farces eternal father
i want to eat till i am till i want to drink my bill
honor jan size
to sleep
to do nothing
i want to have my turn so i do come now
before i die
i want to be a bit of a million naire
he took a turn round the novel and added like other people
what do you mean by that
asked the woman
he shook his head winked screwed up one eye and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration what do i mean by that
listen
bush
muttered the woman not so loud
these are matters which must not be overheard
bah
our neighbor
i saw him go out a little while ago
and i tell you that i saw him go out
nevertheless by a sort of instinct job see the lowered his voice although not sufficiently to pre feng markus hearing his words
one favorable circumstance which enabled marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard
this is what marius heard listen carefully
the croesus is caught or as good as caught
everything is arranged
i have seen some people
to bring sixty francs the rascal
did you notice how i played that game on him by sixty france my landlord my fourth of february
mother bouton is off washing dishes in the city
the children shall stand on watch
you shall help us
he will give in
and what if he does not give in
demanded his wife
and he burst out laughing
this was the first time marius had seen him laugh
the laugh was cold and sweet and provoked a shudder
jon dee the opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from it an old cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve
i have some more people that i must see
good ones
if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back again
he would have slipped through our fingers
it was my beard that saved us
my romantic beard
my pretty little romantic beard
and again he broke into a laugh
he stepped to the window
the snow was still falling and streaking the gray of the sky
what beastly weather
said he
then lapping his overcoat across his breast this fund is too large for me
nevermind he added he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel
what shall points things hang on any way
and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quitted the room
he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening
i calendar for getting said he
you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready
a brazier of charcoal
asked his wife
yes
how many bushels
two good ones
that will come to thirty sous
with the rest i will buy something for dinner
the devil no
why
why
because i shall have to buy something too
what
something
how much shall you need
the mouffetard
ah
yes at the corner of a street i can see the shop
but tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase
fifty sous three france
eating is not the point today
at this word from his wife mindre the closed the door again and this time marius heard his steps of a way in the corridor of the novel and descend the staircase rapidly
chapter xiii solus cum solo un poco de moto non do not a guntur or are paternoster marius dreamer as he was was as we have said firm and energetic by nature
his habits of solitary meditation while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion had perhaps diminished the faculty for irrigation but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had the kindliness of a brahmin and the severity of a judge he took pity upon a road but he crushed a viper
now it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed it was a nest of monsters that he had beneath his eyes
these wretches must be stamped upon said he
not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated in the contrary all of them had been rendered more at her if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the luxembourg and the man whom he called m
leblanc except that monde et he was acquainted with the n
athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered the only thing on which he caught a distinct vii move was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparations dark but terrible trap that both of them were incurring great danger she probably her father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the job fretted must be thwarted and the web of these spiders broken
he scanned the female jon frette for a moment
she had pulled an old sheet iron stove from a corner and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron
he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to make the least noise
amid his terror as to what was in preparation and in the horror with which the kind refresh as inspired him he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him pst maps to render a service to the one whom he loved
but how was it to be done
how warn the persons threatened
he did not know their address
they had reappeared for an instant before his eyes and had them plunged back again into the immense depths of paris
should be wait form
bution frette and his men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely they were stronger than me they would device means to seize him or to get him away and the man whom marius was anxious to save would be lost
marius had five hours before him
there was but one thing to be done
he put on his decent coat knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck took his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet
moreover the jon dee the women continued to rummage among her old iron
once outside of the house he made for the rue du petit ban quiet
he had almost reached the middle of this street near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he heard voices talking very close by
he turned his head the street was deserted there was not a soul i got it was broad daylight and yet he distinctly heard voices
it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting
there in fact sat two men flat on the snow with their backs against the wall talking together in subdued tones
these two persons were strangers to him one was a bearded man in a blouse and the other a long haired individual in rags
by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear their remarks
do you think so
said the bearded man
then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the tao te theatre
marius went his way
that must be the affair
he directed his course towards the faubourg saint marceau and asked at the first stop he came to where he could find a commissary of police
he was directed to rue de pontoise no
thither marius betook himself
on the way he rendered justice to providence
be reflected that had he not given his five france to the kind betts girl in the morning he would have followed m
leblanc would have been lost and his daughter with him no doubt
chapter xiv in which a police agent bestows two fistfuls on a lawyer on arriving at no
rue de pontoise he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police
the commissary of police is not here said a clerk but there is an inspector who takes his place
would you like to speak to him
are you in haste
yes said markus
there stood at all man behind a grating leaning against a stove and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast top coat with three dollars
his face was square with a thin firm mouth thick gray and very ferocious whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out
of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but that it searches
what do you want
he said to marius without adding monsieur
is this monsieur le commissaire de police
he is absent
i am here in his stead
the matter is very private
then speak
and great taste is required
then speak quick
this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time
he inspired fear and confidence
at the sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said coldly so it is in the room at the end of the corridor
precisely answered marius and he added are you acquainted with that house
the inspector remained silent for a moment then replied as he warned the heel of his boot at the door of the stove apparently
he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so much as his cravat patron minette must have had a hand in this
this words truck marius
patron minette said he i did hear that word pronounced in fact
and he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du petit ban quiet
the inspector muttered the long haired man must be brunob and the bearded one de miller dallas deux milliards
he had dropped his eyelids again and became absorbed in thought
they always have too much fire in these cursed stoves
number
former property of god beau
then he glanced at marius
you saw only that bearded and that long haired man
and pancha us
no
nor a big lump of matter resembling an elephant in the jardin des plantes
no
nor as camp with the air of an old red tail
no
as for the fourth no one sees him not even his adjutants clerks and employees
it is not surprising that you did not see him
no
who are all those persons
asked marius
the inspector answered besides this is not the time for them
he relapsed into silence then resumed
i know that barrack
impossible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us and then they will get off simply by count demanding the vaudeville
they are so modest
an audience embarrassed them
none of that none of that
i want to hear them sing and make them dance
this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at him intently the whole are you afraid
of what
said marius
of these men
no more than yourself
retorted markus rudely who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him
the inspector stared still more intently at marius and continued with sententious solemnity there you speak like a brave man and like an honest man
courage does not fear crime and honesty does not fear authority
marius interrupted him that is well but what do you intend to do
the inspector contented himself with the remark the lodger shade pads keys with which to get in at night
you must have one
yes said marika
have you it about you
yes
give it home said the inspector
marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket handed it to the inspector and added if you will take my advice you will come in force
the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the two immense pockets of his top coat and pulled out two small steel pistols of the sort called knock medians
then he presented them to marius saying rapidly in a curt tone take these
go home
hide in your chamber so that you may be supposed to have gone out
they are loaded
each one carries two balls
you will keep watch there is shops in the wall as you have informed me
these men will come
leave them to their own devices for a time
when you think matters have reached a crisis and that it is time to put a ship to them for each of
not too soon
the rest concerns me
a shot into the ceiling the air no matter where
above all things not too soon
wait until they begin to put their project into execution you are a lawyer you know the proper point
marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat
that makes a lump that can be seen as if the inspector
put them in your trousers pocket
marius must be pistoia in his trousers pockets
now pursued the inspector there is not a minute more to be lost by anyone
what time is it
half past two
i have plenty of time said the inspector but no more than enough
bang
a pistol shot
resteasy said marius
and as marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out the inspector called to him by the way if you have occasion for my services between now and they come or send here
you will ask for inspector javert
the snow had redoubled in violence and filled the air
bus such was just saying to source trac one would say to see all these snowflakes fall that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven
all at once bossuet caught sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air
hold
sale bosquet
i saw him said source trac
why
he is busy
with what
what air
he has the air of a man who is following someone
must see the eyes he is making
sales our vet rec
but who the deuce is he following
some fine flowery bonnet ed wench
a man in fact wearing a gray cap and whose graybeard could be distinguished although they only saw his back was walking along about twenty paces in advance of marius
this man was dressed in a great coat which was perfectly new and too large for him and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud
bossuet burst out laughing
who is that man
he
posts are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of peers of france
bosquet
exclaimed source traceable ormeaux
you are a prodigious brute
follow a man who is following another man indeed
they terraced their steps
marius had in fact seen jon dee the passing along the rue mouffetard and was spying on his proceedings
home fette walked straight ahead without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance
he quitted the rue mouffetard and marius saw him enter one of the most terrible novels in the rue gracie use he remained there about a quarter of an hour then returned to the rue mouffetard
at the top of the rue petit gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the rue du petit ban quiet
the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again
marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the rue du petit ban quiet which was deserted as usual and did not follow jon frette into it
it was lucky that he did so for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the long haired man and the bearded man conversing monde et he turned round made sure that no one was following him did not see him then sprang across the wall and disappeared
the wasteland bordered by this wall communicated with the backyard of an ec livery stable keeper of bad repute who had failed and who still kept a few old single seater berlins under his sheds
marius had given his key to the inspector of police it was important therefore that he should make haste
evening had arrived night had almost closed in on the horizon and in the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun and that was the moon
it was rising in a ruddy flow behind the low some of salpetriere
marius returned to no
with great strides
the door was still open when he arrived
he mounted the stairs on tiptoe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber
this corridor as the reader will remember was bordered on both sides by attics all of which were for the moment empty and to let
as he passed one of these attics marius though the perceived in the uninhabited sell the motionless heads of four men vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight falling through a dormer window
marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself
he succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise
it was high time
chapter xvi in which will be found the words to an english air which was in fashion in marius seated himself on his bed
only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen
he heard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark
he thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark crime advancing on one side justice coming up on the other
he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place
as is the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets
it was no longer showing the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect
there was a light in the job fretted en
marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to tim
it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle
however there was not a sound in the jon dee the quarters not a soul was moving there not a soul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre
marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed
several minutes elapsed
marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the latch of the novel was noisily lifted it was jon dee the returning
instantly several voices arose
the whole family was in the garret
good evening daddy helped the girls
well
said the mother
good
you have dressed up
you have done well
you must inspire confidence
all ready to go out
you will do everything sure
resteasy
because said jon dee the
and he left the phrase unfinished
marius heard him lay something heavy on the table pro ha glu the chisel which he had purchased
by the way said jim frette have you been dating here
yes said the mother
i got three large potatoes and some salt
i took advantage of the fire to cook them
good returned jon dee the
tomorrow i will take you out to dine with me
we will have a duck and fixings
you shall done like charles the tenth all is going well
then he added the mouse trap is open
the cats are there
he lowered his voice still further and said put this in the fire
marius heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the rings or some iron utensil and jon dee the continued have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak
yes replied the mother
what time is it
nearly six
the half hour struck from saint med area while ago
the devil
ejaculated jon dee the the children must go and watch
come you do you listen here
a whispering ensued
yes said the mother
he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his dinner hour
you are sure
surf
jeremy girl take the candle and got here
marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his new
hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived a light through the crack of his door
he recognized the voice of the eldest daughter
did you goin
demanded her father
no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out
the father exclaimed go in nevertheless
the door opened and marius saw the tail jon dee the come in with a candle in her hand
she was as she had been in the morning only still more repulsive in this light
she walked straight up to the bed
marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps
she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it
in the neighboring room the sound of iron articles being moved was audible
she smoothed her hair with the palm other hand and smiled into the mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice no sam our son try reroute une semaine mais que du bonheur les instant saint courts
le temps des a hours devait durer toujours
devrait durer toujours
devrait durer toujours
in the meantime marius trembled
it seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing
she stepped to the window and looked out with the half foolish way she had
how ugly paris is when it has put on a white chemise
said she
she returned to the mirror and began again to put on aids before it scrutinizing herself full face and three quarters face in turn
well
dried her father what are you about there
booby
helped her father
come here thus minute
coming
coming
said she
one has no time for anything in this novel
she hummer vous ne quitted plural kerala gloire mon triste coeur suivre partout
she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out shutting the door behind her
one on the side of the barrier the other at the corner of the rue du petit ban quiet
as hard as you can go
you have a key to get in
the eldest girl grumbled the idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot
tomorrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots
said the father
they ran downstairs and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside
there now remained in the house only marius the hon fretted and probably also the mysterious persons or whom marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic
in a twinkling and with the ability of his age he had reached the hole in the partition
he looked
the interior of the jon dee the apartment presented a curious aspect and marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed
a candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris but that was not what really lighted the chamber
the novel was completely illuminated as it were by the reflect job from a rather large sheet iron brazier standing in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal the brazier prepared by the non see the woman that morning
the charcoal was glowing hot and the frazier wasted a blue flame flickered over it and helped him to make out the form of the chief i purchased by jon dee the in the rue pierre lombard where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat
in one corner near the door and as though prepared for some definite use two meals were visible which appeared to be the one a heap of old iron the other a heap of ropes
all this would have caused the kind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation to saver between a very sinister and a very simple idea
throw in this lighted up more resembled a forget mans mouth of hell both on frette on this light had rather the air of a demon than of a smith
the heat of the brazier was so great that the candle on the table was melting in the side near the chafing dish and was drooling over
an old dark lantern of copper worthy of diogenes turned cartouche stood on the chimney piece
the brazier placed in the fireplace itself beside the nearly extinct brands sent its vapors up the chimney and gave out good or
the moon entering through the four lanes of the window castles whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret and to the poetic spirit of marius who was dreamy even in the moment of action it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth
a breath of air which made its way in through the open page helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier
the jon dee the laird as if the reader recalls what we have said of the goffeau building admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed and as the envelope for a crime
it was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in paris
if the system of ambush and traps had not already existed they would have been invented there
the whole thickness of a house and a multitude of uninhabited rooms separated this den from the boulevard and the only window that existed opened on wastelands enclosed with walls and palisades
jon dee the bad lighted his pipe seated himself on the seat less chair and was engaged in smoking
his wife was talking to him in a low tone
if marius had been source trac that is to say one of those men who laugh on every occasion in life he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the jon dee the woman
she had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds at arms at the so donation of charles x
it was this toilette which had extracted from non frette the exclamation good
you have dressed up
you have done well
you must inspire confidence
as for non frette he had not taken off the new surtout which was too large for him and which m
all at once jon dee the lifted up his voice by the way
now that i think of it
in this weather he will come in a carriage
light the lantern take it and go downstairs
you will stand behind the lower door
the very moment that you hear the carriage stop you will open the door instantly he will come up you will light the staircase and the corridor and when he enters here you will go downstairs again as speedily as possible you will pay the coachman and dismiss the fiacre
and the money
inquired the woman
jon dee the fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five france
she exclaimed
none yet he replied with dignity that is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning
and he added do you know what
two chairs will be needed here
what for
to sit in
marius delta cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from non dredge
larrieu
and with a rapid movement she opened the door of the demand went out into the corridor
marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode reach his bed and conceal himself beneath it
take the candle cried jon dee the
no sales be it would embarrass me i have the two chairs to carry
there is moonlight
the door opened
he remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror
the mindre the entered
the dormer window permitted the entrance of a day of moonlight between two blocks of shadow
one of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against which marius was leaning so that he disappeared within it
mother jon dee the raised her eyes did not see marius took the two chairs the only ones which marius possessed and went away letting the door fall heavily to behind her
where entered the lair
here are the two chairs
and here is the lantern
go down as quick as you can
she hastily obeyed and none yet he was left alone
he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table turned the chisel in the brazier set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing dish then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope and bent down as though to examine something
marius then recognized the fact that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well made rope ladder with wooden rings and two hooks with which to attach it
those are the utensils of an edge toolmaker thought marius
had marius been a little more learner in this line he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of an edge toolmaker certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock and others which will cut or slice the two families of tools which bug fix recall cadets and faux hants
the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius
the brazier being concealed the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle the smallest bit of crockery on the table or in the chimney piece cast a large shadow
there was something indescribably calm threatening and hideous about this chamber
one felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible
jon dee the had allowed his pipe to go out a serious sign of preoccupation and had again seated himself
the candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance
he indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfoldings of the right hand as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue
in the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him took out along kitchen knife which was concealed there and tried the edge of its blade on his mail
that done he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it
marius on his side grasped the pistol in his right pocket drew it out and cock edit
the pistol emitted a sharp clear click ashe cock edit
jon frette started half rode listened a moment then began to laugh and said what a fool i am
marius kept the pistol in his hand
jon frette marked off each stroke with a toss of his head
when the sixth had struck he sniffed the candle with his fingers
then he began to pace up and down the room listened at the corridor walked on again then listened once more
provided only that becomes
he muttered then he returned to his chair
he had hardly re seated himself when the door opened
mother monde et he had opened it and now remained in the corridor making a horrible amiable grimace which one of the holes of the dark lantern illuminated from below
enter sir she said
enter my benefactor repeat we jon dee the rising hastily
m
leblanc made his appearance
he wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable
he laid four louis on the table
monsieur fagan you said he this is for your rent and your most pressing necessities
we will attend to the rest hereafter
may god require it to you my generous benefactor
said jon dee the
and rapidly approaching his wife dismiss the carriage
she slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering m
leblanc a chair
the snow which had not ceased falling since the morning was so deep that the arrival of the fiacre had not been audible and they did not now hear its departure
meanwhile m
leblanc had seated himself
jon dee the had taken possession of the other chair facing m
leblanc
now in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow let the reader picture to himself in his own mind a cold night the solitudes of the salpetriere covered with snow and white as winding sheets in the moonlight the taper like lights of the street patterns which shone feel there and there along those tragic boulevards and the long rows of black elms not a passerby for perhaps a quarter of a league around the gorge auto delay its highest pitch of silence of horror and of darkness in that building in the midst of those solitudes in the midst of that darkness the vast jon dee the garret lighted by a single candle and in that went women seated at a table m
leblanc tranquil jon dee the smiling and alarming the jon dee the woman the female wolf in one corner and behind the partition marius invisible erect not losing a word hot missing a single movement his eye on the watch and pistol in hand
however marius experienced only an emotion of horror but no fear
he clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured
i shall be able to stop that wretch whenever i please he thought
he felt that the police were there somewhere in ambuscade waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm
moreover he was in hopes that this violent encounter between jon dee the age m
leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was interested in learning
leblanc seated when he turned his eyes towards the pallets which were empty
how is the poor little wounded girl
he inquired
bad replied jon frette with a heartbroken and grateful smile very bad my worthy cir
her elder sister has taken her to the bourne to have her hurt dresses
you will see them presently they will be back immediately
madame fagan you seems to me to be better went on m
leblanc casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the jon dee the woman as she stood between him and the door as though already guarding the exit and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat
she is dying said jon dee the
but what do you expect air
she has so much courage that woman has
the jon dee the touched by his compliment deprecated it with the affected airs of a flattered monster
you are always too good time monsieur jon dee the
jon dee the
said m
leblanc i thought your name was fab anjou
fagan you alias jon dee the
replied the husband hurriedly
an artistic sobriquet
and launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which k
leblanc did not catch he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice am
we have had a happy life together this poor darling and i
what would there be left for us if we had not that
we are so wretched my respectable air
we have arms but there is no work
we have the will no work
here for instance i wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper box makers
a trade
a trade
a simple trade
a breadwinner
what we all my benefactor
what a degradation when one has been what we have been
alas
there is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity
one thing only a picture of which i think a great deal but which i am willing to part with for i must live
item one must live
while non frette this talked with an apparent in coherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy markus raised his eyes and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before
a man had just entered so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges
this may words violet knitted vest which was old work spotted cut and gaping at every gold wide trousers of cotton velvet wooden shoes on his feet no shirt had his neck bare his bare arms tattooed and his face smeared with black
he had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed and as he was behind jon dee the he could only be indistinctly seen
that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m
leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius
he could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape jon dee the
ah
i see
exclaimed jon dee the buttoning up his coat with an air of complaisance you are looking at your overcoat
it fits me
my faith but it fits me
who is that man
said m
leblanc
jim
the neighbor was a singular looking individual
however manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg saint marceau
many of the workmen might have black faces
besides this h
he went on excuse me what were you saying j
fagan you
i was telling you sit and dear protector replied jon dee the placing his elbows on the table and contemplating m
leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the boa constrictor i was telling you that i have a picture to sell
a slight sound came from the door
a second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed behind mindre the
like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of inuit lampblack
although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been able to prevent m
leblanc catching sight of him
so i was saying that there remains in my possession a valuable picture
but stops or take a look at ut
heroes went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned and turned it round still leaving it supported against the wall
it really was something which resembled a picture and which the candle illuminated somewhat
marius could make nothing out of it as yonder the stood between the picture and him he only saw a coarse day bands sort of principal personage colored with the harsh cruelty of foreign canvasses and screen paintings
what is that
asked m
leblanc
jon dee the exclaimed a painting by a master a picture of great value my benefactor
i am as much attached to it as i am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs home
but i have told you and i will not take it back that i am so wretched that i will part with it
either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness n
there were now four men three seated on the be done standing near the door post all four with bare arms and motionless with faces smeared with black
one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep
he was old his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect
the other two seemed to be young one wore a beard the other wore his hair long
none of them had on shoes those who did not wear socks were barefooted
jon dee the noticed that m
they are friends
they are neighbors said he
their faces are black because they work in charcoal
they are chimney builders
have pity on my misery
i will not ask you much for it
how much do you think it is worth
well said m
leblanc looking jon dee the full in the eye and with the manner of a man who is on his guard it is done signboard for a tavern and is worth about three craggs
jon dee the replied sweetly have you your pocketbook with you
i should be satisfied with a thousand crowns
m
leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid glance around the room
he had jon dee the on his left on the side near the window and the yonder the woman and the four men on his right on the side near the door
the four men did not stir and did not even seem to be looking on
jon dee the bad again begun to speak in a plaintive tone with so vague an eye and so lamentable an intimation that m
leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery
if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactor said jon dredge i shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river
well
a table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required then a special stove is needed a lot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the past f according as it is to be used for wood paper or stuff a paring knife to cut the cardboard should go adjust its hammerton all the steels pincers how the devil do i know what all
and all that in order to earn four sousa day
and you have to work fourteen hours a day
and you must keep the past shot
the devil i tell you
four sousa day
how do you suppose a man is to live
as he spoke monde et he did not look at m
leblanc who was observing him
m
j
leblanc seemed to be asking himself is this man an idiot
jon dee the repeated two or three distinct times with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplicating order there is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river
i went down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose
all at once his full eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little man sees himself up and became terrible took a step toward m
leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder that has nothing to do with the question
do you know me
chapter xv the trap the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses and masked with masks of black paper
the third a man with thick set shoulders not so slender as the first held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison
it appeared that the arrival of these men was what monde et he had been waiting for
a rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel the thin one
is everything ready
said jon dee the
yes replied the thin man
where is montparnasse
the young principal act or stopped to chat with your girl
which
the eldest
is there a carriage at the door
yes
if the team harnessed
yes
with two good horses
excellent
i sit waiting where i ordered
yes
good said jon dee the
m
leblanc was very pale
he was scrutinizing everything around him in the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into and his head directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear
he had improvised an in french ment out of the table and the man who but an instant previously had borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man had suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture
this old man who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger seemed to possess one of those natures which areas courageous as they are kind both easily and simply
the father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us
marius felt proud of that unknown man
three of the men of whom monde et he had said they are chimney builders had armed themselves from the pile of old iron one with a heavy pair of shears the second with weigh in thongs the third with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable
the old man had remained on the bed and had merely opened his eyes
the jon dee the woman had seated herself beside him
marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling in the direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol
more dette having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel turned once more tom
leblanc and repeated his question accompanying it with that los repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him so you do not recognize me
m
leblanc looked him fill in the face and replied no
then mindre the advanced to the table
he leaned across the candle crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m
leblanc to retreat and in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite he exclaimed my name is not fagan you my name is not jon dee the my name is thenardier
i am the innkeeper of mont vermeil
do you understand
thenardier
how do you know me
an almost imperceptible flush crossed m
marius did not hear this reply
anyone who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard stupid thunderstruck
at the moment when jon dee the said my name is thenardier marius had trembled in every limb and had leaned against the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart
then his right arm all ready to discharge the signals not dropped slowly and at the moment when jon are the repeated thenardier do you understand
jon dee the by revealing his identity has not moved m
leblanc but he had quite upset marius
that name of the barrier with which m
leblanc did not seem to be acquainted marius knew well
let the reader recall what that name meant to him
before it at the bottom of his mind in the depths of his memory in that sacred injunction a certain thenardier saved my life
if my son encounters him he will do him all the good that lies in his power
that name it will be remembered was one of the pieties of his soul he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship
what
this man was that the barrier that innkeeper of hong vermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought
he had found him a toast and how
that man to whose service marius was burning to devote himself was a non star
that liberator of colonel pont mercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope marius did not as yet clearly comprehend but which resembled an assassination
and against whom great god
what a fatality
what a bitter mockery of date
he had sworn to himself that if ever be found that the barrier he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet and now he actually had found him but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner
his father said to him succor thenardier
and he replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing the barrier
he was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life executed on the place saint jacques through the means of his son of that marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will
but on the other hand now look on that trap and not prevent it
condemn the victim and to spare the assassin
could one be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch
all the ideas which marius has cherished for the last four years were pierced through and through as it were by this unforeseen blow
he shuddered
everything depended on him
unknown to themselves he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes
if he fired his pistol m
leblanc was saved and thenardier lost if he did not fire m
leblanc would be sacrificed and who knows
the barrier would escape
should be wash down the one or allow the other to fall
re horse awaited him in either case
what was metodo
what should be choose
be false to the most imperious souvenirs to all those solemn vow z to himself to the most sacred duty to the most generated text
on the one hand it seemed to him that he heard his ursule supplicating for her father and on the other the colonel do i mending the barrier to his date
he felt that he was going mad
his knees gave way beneath him
and he had not even the time for deliberation so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe
it was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master and which was now sweeping him away
he was on the verge of swooning
in the meantime thenardier whom we shall henceforth call by no other name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph
he seized the candle in his fish and set it on the chimney piece with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished and they allow be spattered the wall
then he turned tom
leblanc with a horrible look and spit out these words done for
smoked brown
cooked
s pitch cocked
and again he began to march back and forth in full eruption
ah
mister threadbare hill john aire
mister giver of dolls

what bosh
merry andrew
an
well i recognize you that i do
i recognized youth every moment you liked your shout in here
ah
he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment
one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole like the rhone then as though he were c including aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and shouted and with his goody goody air
and a post room is in gm
leblanc par bleu
you made game of me in the past
you are the cause of all my misfortune e
for fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom i had and who certainly belonged to rich people and who had already brought in a great deal of money and from whom i might have extracted enough to live on all my life
a girl who would have made up to me for everything that i lost in that file cookshop where there was nothing but one continual row and where like a fool i ate up my last farthing
lh
i wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it
well nevermind

you had your cudgel in the forest
you were the stronger
revenge
oh but i can laugh
really i laugh
absurd idiot
and the four miserable philip per which he has brought me
scoundrel
and how he swallowed my platitudes
that did amuse me
he was out of breath
his little narrow chest panted like a forge bellows
his eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble cruel and cowardly creature which finds that it can at last harass what it had feared and insult what it has flattered the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of goliath the joy of a jackal which is beginning to renew sick bulk so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself but sufficiently alive to suffer still
m
leblanc did not interrupt him but said to him when he paused i do not know what you mean to say
you are mistaken in me
i am a very poor man and anything but a million naire
i do not know you
you are mistaking me for skis other person
ah
roared thenardier hoarsely a pretty lie
you stick to that pleasantry do you
ah
excuse me sir said m
leblanc with a politeness of accent which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful i see that you are a villain
who has got remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own that monsters are ticklish
at this word villa in the female thenardier sprang from the bed thenardier grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands
he shouted to his wife and turning tom
leblanc villain
yes i know that you call us that you rich gentlemen
shop
ah
we if i see who are thermometers
just see here mister million naire i have been a solid man i have held a license i have been an elector jama bourgeois that i am
here thenardier tools step towards the men who stood near the door and added with a shudder when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler
them addressing m
leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy and listen to this also mister philanthropist
i was at waterloo so i was
all i caught was merci thanks
that would have helped me to find him again
the picture that you see here and which was painted by david at brushes files do you know what it represents
it represents me
david wished to immortalize that fear of prowess
i have that general on my back and i am carrying him through the grapeshot
that general never did a single thing for me he was no better than the rest
but nonetheless i saved his life at the risk of my own and i have the certificate of the fact in my pocket
i am a soldier of water looby all the furies
marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was listening
the last possibility of doubt had just vanished
it certainly was the thenardier of the will
marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying
his perplexity was redoubled
moreover there was in all these words of the barrier in his accent in his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that mixture of braggadocio and abject ness of pride and pettiness of rage and folly in that chaos of real briefs and false sentiments in that immodesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatreds something which was as hideous as evil and as heartrending as the truth
the picture of the master the painting by david which he had proposed that m
leblanc should purchase was nothing else as the reader has divine x than the sign of his tavern painted as it will be remembered by himself the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at mont vermeil
it was the group composed of pont mercy and thenardier the sergeant the rescuer the colonel rescued
marius was like a drunken man this picture restored his father to life in some sort it was no longer the sign board of the wine shop at mont vermeil it was a resurrection atom h had yawned a phantom had risen these
marius heard his heart beating in his temples he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears his bleeding father vaguely depicted on that sinister page p terrified him and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him
when thenardier had recovered his breath he turned his bloodshot eyes on m
leblanc and said to him on a low curt voice what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you
m
leblanc held his peace
it was the man with the axe who was growing merry
at the same mike by an enormous bristling and clayey face made its appearance at the door with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth but fangs
why have you taken off your mask
cried the barrier in a rage
for fun retorted the man
for the last few minutes m
leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of the barriers to blinded and dazzled by his own rate was stalking to and fro in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded and of holding an unarmed name as the being armed himself of being nine against one supposing that the female thenardier counted for but one man
during his address to the man with the pile as she had turned his back to m
leblanc
m
leblanc seized this moment overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist and with one bound with prodigious ability before the barrier had time to turn round he had reached the window
to open it to scale the frame to be stride it was the work of a second only
he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the novel
these were the three chimney builders who had flung themselves upon him
at the same time the thenardier woman has wound her hands in his hair
at the trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor
one of the chimney builders who seem irc her face was lighted up by the candle and in whom marius recognized in spite of his daubing pan chair alias or in tanker alias big demaille lifted a given
marius could not resist this sight
my father he thought forgive me
and his finger sought the trigger of his pistol
this desperate attempt of the victim far from exasperating thenardier had calmed him
there existed in hunt women the ferocious man and the adroit man
up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down and which did not stir the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and tried to resist the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand
he repeated and without suspecting it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting awhile longer
a herculean struggle had begun
with one blow violin the chest m
leblanc had sent the old man tumbling rolling in the middle of the room them with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants and he held one under each of his knees the wretched were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck and were holding him doubled up over the two chimney builders in the floor
thus the master of some and mastered by the rest crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him m
leblanc djs appeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds
they succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window and there they held him in awe
the thenardier woman had not released her clutch on his hair
the thenardier on eyed as the female wolf obeys the male wolf with a growl
now said thenardier search him you other fellows
m
leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance
they searched him
he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six france and his handkerchief
thenardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket
what
no pocketbook
he demanded
non or watch replied one of the chimney builders
thenardier went to the corner near the door picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men
tie him to the leg of the bed said he
and catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the flow from m
sweep him into a corner said thenardier
two of the chimney builders pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet
banet sa is the barrier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel why did you bring so many they were not needed
what can you do
replied the man with the cudgel they all wanted to be in it
this is a bad season
the pallet on which m
leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed elevated on four coarse wooden legs roughly been
m
leblanc let them take their own course
the ruffians found him securely in an upright attitude with his feet on the ground at the head of the bed the end which was most remote from the window and nearest to the fireplace
when the last knot had been tied thenardier took a chair and seated himself almost facing m
leblanc
thenardier no longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness
marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been foaming but a moment before he gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should be hold a tiger converted into a lawyer
monsieur said the harrier
and dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on m
leblanc standoff a little and let me have a talk with the gentleman
all retired towards the door
he went on monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window
you might have broken your leg
now if you will permit me we will converse quietly
in the first place i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry
the barrier was right this detail was correct although it had escaped marius in his agitation
m
leblanc had barely pronounced a few words without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence
thenardier continued mon dieu
you might have done that and noone would have troubled you on that account
you would not even have been tagged
and i will tell you why
this room is very private
you might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the shores of a drunken man
here a cannon would make a book and the thunder would make a loud
but in short you did not shout and it is better so
i present you my compliments and i will tell you the conclusion that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man shouts who comes
the police
and after the police
justice
well
it is because i have long suspected if you have some interest in hiding something
on our side we have the same interest
so we can do it to an understanding
as he spoke thus it seemed as though thenardier who kept his eyes fixed on m
leblanc were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner
moreover his language which was stamped with a sort of moderated subdued insolence and crafty in silence was reserved and almost choice and in that rascal who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood
the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention has been called to it troubled marius and affected him with painful astonishment
here evidently was a soul which was inaccessible to terror and which did not know the meaning of despair
here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances
extreme as was the crisis inevitable as was the catastrophe there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man who opens his horror filled eyes under the water
the barrier to a woman unpretending manner went to the fireplace shoved aside the screen which he leaned against the neighboring pallet and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars
then thenardier returned to his seat beside m
leblanc
i continue said he
we can come to an understanding
let us arrange this matter in an amicable way
for example because you are a million naire i told you that i exacted money alot of money a deal of money
that would not be reasonable
mon dieu in spite of your riches you have expenses of your own who has not
i am not one of those people who because they have the advantage of the position profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous
i only want two hundred thousand francs
m
leblanc uttered not a word
i only ask one thing if you
have the goodness to write what i am about to dictate to you
a grand inquisitor might have envied that smile
thenardier pushed the table close to m
leblanc and took an inlet and a pen and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife
he placed the sheet of paper before m
leblanc
write said he
the prisoner spoke at last
how do you expect me to write
i am bound
ejaculated thenardier you are quite right
understand thoroughly sir that you are in our power at our discretion that no human power can get you out of this and that we shall be really briefed if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities
i know neither your name nor your address but i warn you that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have return ad
now be so good as to write
what
demanded the prisoner
i will dictate
m
leblanc took the pen
thenardier began to dictate my daughter the prisoner shuddered and raised his eyes to thenardier
m
leblanc obeyed
thenardier continued come instantly he paused you address her as thou do you not
who
asked m
leblanc
par bleu
cried thenardier the little one the park
m
leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion i do not know what you mean
go on nevertheless ejaculated thenardier and he continued to dictate done immediately i am in absolute need of the e
the person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct the stone
i am waiting for the e
come with confidence
m
leblanc had written the whole of this
thenardier resumed at
m
leblanc erased the three words
now pursued thenardier sign it
the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded for whom is this letter
you know well retorted the barrier for the little one i just told you so
it was evident that the barrier avoided naming the young girl in question
he said the park he said the little one but he did not pronounce her name the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices
to mention the name was to deliver the whole affair into their hands and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing
he went on sign
what is your name
urbain fabre said the prisoner
thenardier with the movement of a car washes his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on m
leblanc
he looked for the mark on it and held it close to the candle
u
f
urbain fabre
well dignity
f
the prisoner signed
as two hands are required to fold the letter give it time i will fold it
i see that you understand your situation
as you have not lied about your name you will not lie about your address
write it yourself
the prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment then he took the pen and wrote mademoiselle fa breath
thenardier seized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion
wife
he cried
the thenardier woman hastened to him
you know what you have to do
there is a carriage at the door
set out at once and return ditto
and addressing the man with the meataxe since you have taken off your nose screen accompany the mistress
you will get up behind the fiacre
you know where you left the team
yes said the man
and depositing his axe in a corner he followed madame thenardier
remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you
i have it in my bosom
a minute had not elapsed when the sound of the tracking of a ship was heard which rapidly retreated and died away
good
growled thenardier
at such a gallop the bourgeoise will be back inside three quarters of an hour
he drew a chair close to the fireplace holding his arms and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier
my feet are sold
said he
only five ruffians now remained on the den with the barrier and the prisoner
they were crowded together in one corner like brutes and remained silent
thenardier warned his feet
the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturnity
a sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before
the candle on which a large stranger had formed cast but a dim light in the immense novel the frazier had grown dull and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling
no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man who was fast asleep
marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle
the enigma was more impenetrable than ever
who was this little one whom thenardier had called the park
was she how ursule
the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the park and had replied in the most natural manner in the world i do not know what you mean
on the other hand the two letters u
f
were explained they meant urbain fabre and ursule was no longer named ursule
this was what marius perceived most clearly of all
a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene
there he stood almost in cape bid of movement of reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters
he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide
in any case he said if she is the park i shall see her for the thenardier woman is to bring her mother
that will be the end and then i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her
nothing shall stop me
nearly half an hour passed in this manner
thenardier seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir
still marius fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a faint full noise in the direction of the prisoner
all at once thenardier addressed the prisoner by the way monsieur fabre i might as well say it to you at once
these few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation
marius strained his ears
i think that the park really is your daughter and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her
only listen to me a bit
my wife will go and gunther up with your letter
i told my wife to dress herself in the way she did so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her
they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind
somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses
your young lady will be taken to it
she will a light from the fiacre
the prisoner uttered not a syllable
i warn you so that you may be prepared
you see that our intentions are not evil
what
that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back
one of those monsters was to hear her off into the darkness
whither
and what if it were she
it was clear that it was she
marius felt his heart stop beating
what was metodo
discharge the pistol
place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice
this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment
marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heartbreaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none
the tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den
in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again
the prisoner made a movement in his bonds
he had hardly uttered the words when the thenardier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously false address
the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again
she resumed nobodythere
rue saint dominique no
no monsieur urbain fabre
they know not what it means
she paused choking then went on monsieur thenardier
that old fellow has duped you
you are too good you see
he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is and where he keeps his whiners
people are perfectly right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women
nobody at no
no monsieur fabre in the rue saint dominique
and after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all
i spoke to both the porter and the port tessa finest out woman and they know nothing about him
marius breathed freely once more
she ursule of the park be no longer knew what to call her ass safe
while his exasperated wife voc iterated thenardier had seated himself in the table
for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savaged every
finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious to be a false address
what did you expect to gain by that
to gain time
cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut
the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg
before the seven men had time to collect their senses and dawn forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier and had them straightened himself up again and now thenardier the female thenardier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the hotel stared at him in stupefaction as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the red hot chisel which emitted a threatening glow
the judicial examination for host the ambush in the goffeau house eventually gave rise established the fact that a large couple debut and worked in a peculiar fashion was found in the target when the police made their descent on it
this so i piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the valleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape
there are benvenuto cellini win the galleys just as there are violins in language
the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance find a means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common wooden handles knife to saw a siu into two thin plates to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow on the edge of the siu in such a manner that the plates will adhere again
this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is a nod
in this box he hides a watch spring and this watch spring properly handled cuts good sized chains and bags of iron
the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely as i unit shall be possessed liberty
it was a large sou of this sort which during the subsequent search of the police was found under the bed near the window
they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou
it is probable that the prisoner had this so i piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searched him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand and that afterward having his right hand greene unscrewed it and used it as a sad to cut the cords which fastened him which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which marius had observed
as he had not been able to bend down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg
the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise
be easy said bug demaille to thenardier
i tied that law for him
in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it
when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to say he stripped up his left sleeve and added see here
at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh
the crackling of the burning flesh became audible and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the novel
with grand and lofty natures there bolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself
wretches
said he have no more fear of me than i have for you
and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window which had been left open the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flea and help far away on the snow
the prisoner resumed do what you please with me
he was disarmed
seize him
said thenardier
at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone there is only one thing left to do
cut his throat
it was the husband and wife taking counsel together
the barrier walked slowly towards the table opened the drawer and took out the knife
marius fretted with the handle of his pistol
unprecedented perplexity
these two voices continued in interrupt rely that struggle which tormented him to agony
up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two cities but nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself
however the period as urgent the last bounds of delay had been reached the married was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner
marius cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair
all at once a shudder ran through him
at his feet on the table a bright day of light from the full moon illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper
on this paper he read the following line written that very morning in large letters by the eldest of the thenardier girls the hobbies are here
he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round it and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den
it was high time
thenardier had conquered his last fears of his last scruples and was advancing on the prisoner
something is falling
cried the thenardier woman
what is it
asked her husband
the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster
she handed it to her husband
where did this come from
demanded thenardier
pardue
ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from
through the window of course
i saw it pass said big ten zille
thenardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle
the devil
he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper then he added in a subdued voice quick
the ladder
asked the thenardier woman
through what
resumed big demaille
through the window replied thenardier
since po nine has thrown the stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on that side
this was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action onboard ship
the ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window and solidly fastened to the sill by the two iron books
the prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him
he seemed to be dreaming of praying
as soon as the ladder was arranged thenardier cried dome
the bourgeoise first
and he rushed headlong to the window
but just as he was about to throw his leg over big demaille seized him roughly by the collar
not much come now you old dog after us
after us
yelled the ruffians
you are children said thenardier we are losing time
the police are on our heels
thenardier exclaimed are you mad
are you crazy
what a lack of boobies
you want to waste time do you
draw lots do you
by a wet finger by a short straw
with written names
thrown into a hat
would you like my hat
cried a voice on the threshold
all wheeled round
it was javert
he had his hat in his hand and was holding it out to them with a smile
chapter xxi one should always begin by arresting the victims at nightfall javert had posted his men and had gone into an bush himself between the trees of the rue de la barriers des gobelins which faced the goffeau house on the other side of the boulevard
he had begun operations by opening his pockets and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping search on the approaches to the den
but he had only canada selma
as for eponine she was not at her posts he had disappeared and he had not been able to seize her
then javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon
the comings and goings of the fi acres had greatly agitated him
at last he had grown impatient and sure that there was anesth here sure of being in luck having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol shot
he had arrived just in the nick of time
the terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight
in less than a second these seven men horrible to behold had grouped themselves in an attitude of defence one with his meataxe another with his key another with his bludgeon the rest with shears pincers and hammers
thenardier had his knife in his fist
the thenardier woman snatched up an enormous paving stone which lay in the angle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman
illustration snatched up a paving stone b paving stone javert out on his hat again and advanced a couple of paces into the room with arms folded his cane under one arm his sword in its sheath
halt there said he
you shall not go out by the window you shall go through the door
there are seven of you there are fifteen of us
do you care
par bleu
replies thenardier
well then fire
thenardier took the pistol and aimed at javert
the barrier pulled the trigger
the pistol missed hire
ejaculated javert
i surrender
and you
is very asked the rest of the ruffians
they replied so do we
i only ask one thing said big demaille and that is that i may not be denied tobacco while i am in confinement
granted said javert
and turning round and falling behind him come in now
they pinioned the ruffians
this throng of men sparely lighted by the single candle filled the sen with shadows
handcuff the mall
shouted javert
come on
the thenardier woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window and it was she who had just given vent to this road
the policemen and agents recoiled
she had thrown off her shawl but retained her bonnet her husband who was crouching behind her was almost hidden under the discarded shawl and she was shielding him with her body as she elevates the paving stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock
beware
she shouted
all crowded back towards the corridor
a broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret
the thenardier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinioned and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents the cowards
javert smiled and advanced across the open space which the thenardier was devouring with her eyes
what a grenadier
and he continued to advance
at the same moment javert reached the thenardier couple
the handcuffs
he shouted
the thenardier female overwhelmed stared at her li joined hands and at those of her husband who had dropped to the floor and exclaimed we doing my daughters
they are in the jun said javert
in the meanwhile the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door and were shaking him he awoke stammering is it all over jon dee the

the six pinioned ruffians were standing and still preserved their spectral mien all three be smeared with black all three masked

that said he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table where the candle and the writing materials still remained drew a stamped paper from his pocket and began to prepare his report
when he had written the first lines which are formulas that never vary he raised his eyes let the gentleman whom these gentlemen found step forward
the policemen glanced round them

as soon as he had found himself released from his bonds and while javert was drawing up his report he had taken advantage of confusion the crowd the darkness and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him to wash out of the window
an agent sprang to the opening and looked out

a few pages of history chapter i seki cut and the two years which are immediately connected with the revolution of july form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history
these two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them
they have a revolutionary grandeur
precipices are to be distinguished there
the social has see the very as sizes of civilization the solid group of superposed and adhering interests the century old profiles of the ancient french formation appear and disappear in them every instant athwart the storm clouds of systems of passions and of theories
these appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance
at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried shining there
this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow of our grasping the principal lines even at the present day
we shall make the attempt
the restoration had been one of those intermediate phases hard to define in which there is fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting place
these epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit
in the beginning the nation as is nothing but repose it thirsts for but one thing peace it has but one ambition to be small
which is the translation of remaining tranquil
of great events great hazards great adventures great men thank god we have seen enough we have them heaped higher than our heads
we would exchange caesar for pru size and napoleon for the king of y de tot
what a good little king waste
we have marched since daybreak we have reached the evening of a long and toil someday we have made our first change with mirabeau the second with robespierre the third with bonaparte we are worn out
each one demands a bed
devotion which is weary heroism which has grown old ambitions which are dated fortunes which are made seek demand implore solicit what
a shelter
they have it
they take possession of peace of tranquillity of leisure behold they are content
but at the same time certain facts arise compel recognition and knock at the door in their turn
these facts are the products of revolutions and wars they are they exist they have the right to install themselves on society and they do install themselves therein and most of the time facts are the stewards of the household and couriers who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles
this then is what appears to philosophical politicians at the same time that weary men demand repose accomplished facts demand guarantees
guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men
this is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector this is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire
these guarantees are a necessity of the times
they must be accorded
princes grant them but in reality it is the force of things which gives them
a profound truth and one useful to know which the stuarts did not suspect in and which the bourbons did not even obtain a glimpse of in
the predestined family which returned to france when napoleon fell had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed and that what it had bestowed it could take back again that the house of bourbon possessed the right divine that france possessed nothing and that the political right conceded in the charter of louis xviii
was merely a branch of the right divine was detached by the house of bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should please the king to re assume it
still the house of bourbon should have felt from the displeasure created by the gift that it did not come from it
this house was churlish to the nineteenth century
it put on an ill tempered look at every development of the nation
to make use of a trivial word that is to say of a popular and a true word it looked glum
the people saw this
it thought it possessed strength because the empire had been carried away before it like a theatrical stage setting
it did not perceive that it has itself been brought in in the same fashion
it did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed napoleon
it thought that it has roots because it was the past
it was mistaken it formed a part of the past but the whole past was france
the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons but in the nations
these obscure and lively roots constituted not the right of a family but the history of a people
they were everywhere except under the throne
the house of bourbon was to france the illustrious and bleeding knot in her history but was no longer the principal element of her destiny and the necessary base of her politics
she could get along without the bourbons she had done without them for two and twenty years there had been a break of continuity they did not suspect the fact
and how should they have suspected if they who fancied that louis xvii
reigned in the thot thermidor and that louis xviii
was reigning at the battle of marengo
never since the origin of history had princes been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which facts contain and promulgate
never had that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high
a capital error which left his family to pay its hand once more on the guarantees granted in on the concession was interned them
sad
a sad thing
what it termed its concessions were our conquests what it termed our encroachments were our rights
when the hour seemed to it to have come the restoration supposing itself victorious over bonaparte and well rooted in the country that is to say believing itself to be strong and deep abruptly decided on its plan of action and risk edits stroke
one morning it drew itself up before the face of france and elevating its voice it contested the collective title and their dividual right of the nation to sovereignty of the citizen to liberty
in other words it denied to the nation that which have it a nation and to the citizen that which made him a citizen
this is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the ordinances of july
the restoration fell
it fell justly
but we admit it had not been absolutely hostile to all forms of progress
great things had been accomplished with it alongside
under the restoration the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion which had been lacking under the republicans to grandeur in peace which had been wanting under the empire
france free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of europe
the revolution had had the word under robespierre the cannon had had the word under bonaparte it was under louis xviii
and charles x
that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word
the wind ceased the torch was lighted once more
on the lofty heights the pure light of mind could be seen flickering
a magnificent useful and charming spectacle
for a space of fifteen years those great principles which are so old for the thinkers ones for the statesman could be seen at work in perfect peace on the public square equality before the law liberty of conscience liberty of speech liberty of the press the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions
thus it proceeded until
the bourbons were an instrument of civil ization which broke in the hands of providence
the fall of the bourbons was full of grandeur not on their side but on the side of the nation
they quitted the throne with gravity but without authority their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history it was neither the spectral calm of charles i
nor the eagles cream of napoleon
they departed that is all
they laid down the crown and retained no aureole
they were worthy but they were not august
they lacked in a certain measure the majesty of their misfortune
charles x
during the voyage from cherbourg causing a roundtable to be cut over into a square table appeared to be more anxious about imperilled etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy
this diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons and serious men who honored their race
the populace was admirable
the nation attacked one morning with weapons by a sort of royal insurrection felt itself in the possession of so much force that it did not go into a rage
it defended itself restrained itself restored things to their places the government to law the bourbons to exile alas
and then halted
it took the old king charles x
from beneath that daos which had sheltered louis xiv
and set him gently on the ground
it touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution
it was not one man it was not a few men it was france france entire france victorious and intoxicated with her victory who seemed to be coming to herself and who put into practice before the eyes of the whole world these grave words of guillaume du fait after the day of the barricades it is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors of the great and to spring like a bird from bought i bought roman afflicted fortune to a flourishing one to show themselves harsh towards their prince in his adversity but as for me the fortune of my kings and especially of my afflicted kings will always be venerable home
the bourbons carried away with them respect but not regret
as we have just stated their misfortune was greater than they were
they faded out in the horizon
the revolution of july instantly had friends and enemies throughout the entire world
the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm the others turned away each according to his nature
at the first blush the princes of europe the owls of this dawn shut their eyes wounded and stupefied and only opened them to threaten
a bright which can be comprehended a wrath which can be pardoned
this strange revolution had hardly produces a shock it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy and of shedding its blood
in the eyes of despotic governments who are always interested in having liberty c alumni are itself the revolution of july committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle
nothing however was attempted or plotted against it
the most discontented the most irritated the most trembling saluted it whatever our egotism and our rancor may be a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration of someone who is working above man
the revolution of july is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact
a thing which is full of splendor
right overthrowing the fact
hence the brilliancy of the revolution of hence also its mildness
right triumphant has no need of being violent
right is the just and the true
the property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure
the fact even when most necessary to all appearances even when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries if it exist only as a fact and if it contain only too little of right or none at all is infallibly destined to become in the course of time deformed in pure perhaps even monstrous
if one desires to learn stone blow to what degree of hideousness the fact can attain viewed at the distance of centuries let him look at machiavelli
machiavelli is not an evil genius not a demon not a miserable and cowardly writer he is nothing but the fact
and he is not only the italian fact he is the european fact the fact of the sixteen th century
he seems hideous and so he is in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth
this conflict of right and each has been going on ever since the origin of society
to terminate this duel to amalgamate the pure idea with the humane reality to cause right to penetrate pacific ally into the fact and the fact into right that is the task of wages
chapter ii badly sewer but the task of sands is one thing the task of clever men is another
the revolution of came to a sudden halt
as soon as a revolution has made the coast the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck
the skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of statesmen so that this word statesmen has ended by becoming somewhat of a slang word
it must be borne in mine in fact that wherever there is nothing but skill there is necessarily pettiness
to say the skilful amounts to saying the mediocre
in the same way to say statesmen is sometimes equivalent to saying traitors
if then we are to believe the skilful revolutions like the revolution of july are severed arteries a prompt ligature is indispensable
the right too grandly proclaimed is shaken
also night once firmly fixed the state must be strengthened
liberty once assured attention must be directed to power
here the wages are not as yet separated from the skilful but they begin to be distrustful
power very good
but in the first place what is power
in the second whence comes it
the skilful do not seem to hear the murmured objection and they continue their manoeuvres
according to the politicians who are ingenious in putting the mask of necessity on profitable fictions the first requirement of a people after a revolution when this people forms part of a monarchical continent is to procure for itself a dynasty
in this way say they peace that is today time to dress our wounds and to repair the house can be had after a revolution
the dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance
now it is not always easy to procure a dynasty
if it is absolutely necessary the first man of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king
you have in the first case napoleon in the second iturbide
but the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty
there is necessary my required a certain modicum of antiquity in a race and the wrinkle of the centuries can not be improvised
if we place ourselves at the point of view of the statesmen after making all allowances of course after a resolution what are the qualities of the king which result from it
he may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary that is to say a part of ip anton his own person in that revolution that he should have left a hand to it that he should have either compromise for distinguished himself therein that he should have touched the sad or wielded the sword in it
what are the qualities of a dynasty
it should be national that is today revolutionary at a distance nov through acts committed but by reason of ideas accepted
it should be composed of past and be historic be composed of future and be sympathetic
all this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with finding a man from sell or napoleon and why the second absolutely insisted on finding a family the house of brunswick of the house of orleans
royal houses resemble those indian fortress each branch of which bending over to the earth takes root and becomes a big tree itself
each branch may become a dynasty
on the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people
such is the theory of the skilful
practices this theory already applied to england by
is a revolution arrested midway
half of progress quasi right
now logic knows not the almost absolutely as the sun knows not the candle
who arrests revolutions halfway
the bourgeoisie
why
because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction
yesterday it was appetite today it is plenitude tomorrow it will be satiety
the phenomenon of after napoleon was reproduced in after charles x
the attempt has been made and wrongly to make a class of the bourgeoisie
the bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people
the bourgeoisie the man who now has time to sit down
a chair is not a vast e
but through a desire to sit down too soon one may arrest the very march of the human race
this has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie
one is not a class because one has committed a fault
selfishness is not one of the divisions of the social order
moreover we must be just to selfishness
the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness and which contains a little shame it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams it was the half
the half is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory sense a troop on the march that is to say movement act and that is to say repose
the baltic the restoration of forces it is repose armed and on the alert it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its guard
the half presupposes the combat if yesterday and the combat of tomorrow
it is the partition between and
what we he recall combat may also be designated as progress
the bourgeoisie than as well as the statesmen required a man who should express this word halt
an although because
a composite individuality signifying revolution and signifying stability in other terms strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future
this man was already found
the made louis philippe king
lafayette undertook the coronation
he called it the best of republics
the town hall of paris took the place of the cathedral of rheims
this substitution of a half the one for a while the one was the work of
when the skilful had finished the immense code of their solution became apparent
all this has been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute right
absolute right cried i protest
then terrible to say it retired into the darkness
chapter iii louis philippe revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand they strike firmly and choose well
even incomplete even debased and abused and reduced to the state of a junior revolution like the revolution if they nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss
their eclipse is never an abdication
nevertheless let us not boast too loudly resolutions also may be deceived and grave errors have been seen
let us return to
in its deviation had good luck
in the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut short the king amounted to more than royalty
louis philippe was a rare man
the son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame possessing all private virtues and many public virtues careful of his health of his fortune of his person of his affairs knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a tears over serene peaceable patients goodman and a good prince sleeping with his wife and having in his palace jackets charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois an ostentation of the regular sleeping apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch knowing all the languages of europeans what is more rare all the languages of all interests and speaking them an admirable representative of the middle class but outstripping it and in every way greater than it possessing excellent sense while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung counting most of all on his intrinsic worth and on the question of his face very particular declaring himself orleans and not bourbon thoroughly the first prince of the blood royal while he was still only a serene highness but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king diffuse in public concise in private reputed but not proved to be amused at bottom one of those economists who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty lettered but not very sensitive to letters a gentleman but not a chevalier simple calm and strong adored by his family and his household a fascinating talked an undeceived statesman inwardly cold dominated by immediate interest always governing at the shortest range incapable of rancor and if gratitude making use without mercy of superiority in mediocrity clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious in an unities which mutter fully under the ones unreserved sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve but with marvellous address in that imprudence fertile in expedients in countenances in masks making france fear europe and europe france
incontestably fond of his country but preferring his family assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity a disposition which has this unfortunate property that as it turns everything to success it admits of rose and does not absolute it repudiate baseness but which has this valuable side that it preserves politics from violent shocks the state from fractures and society from catastrophes minute correct vigilant attentive sagacious indefatigable contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie bold against austria stand on a obstinate against england in spain bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard singing the marseillaise with conviction inaccessible to despondency to lassitude to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal to daring generosity to utopia to chimeras to wrath to vanity to fear possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity a general at balmya soldiers the mapped attacked eight times by regicide sand always smiling
brave as a grenadier courageous as a thinker uneasy only in the face of the chances of a european shaking up and unfitted for great political adventures always ready to risk his life never his work disguising his will in influence in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king endowed with observation and not with divination not very attentive to minds but knowing men that is to say requiring to see in order to judge prompt and penetrating good sense practical wisdom easy speech prodigious memory drawing incessantly on this memory his only point of resemblance with caesar alexander and napoleon knowing deeds facts details dates proper names ignorant of tendencies passions the diverse geniuses of the crowd the interior aspirations the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls in a word all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences accepted by the surface but little in accord with france lower down extricating himself by dint of fact governing too much and not enough his own first minister excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization of order and organization an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery the founder and lawyer of a dynasty having something of charlemagne and something of an attorney in short a lofty and on inibap figures prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of france and power in spite of the jealousy of europe
louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful
louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age he remained graceful not always approved by the nation he always was so by the masses he pleaded
he had that gift of charming
he lacked majesty he wore no crown although a king and to white hair although an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the news mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited louis philippe was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote is soooo good and he pronounced les hong raiz
he wore the uniform of the national guard like charles x
and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon
he went a little to chapel not at all to the chase never to the opera
incorruptible by sacristan any shippers in by ballet dancers this made a part of his bourgeois popularity
he had no heart
he went out with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole
he was a bit of amazon a bit of a gardener something of a doctor he blew a postilion who had tumbled from his horse louis philippe no more went about without his lancet than did henri iv
without his poniard
the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing
for the grievances against louis philippe there is one deduction to be made there is that which accused royalty that which accuses the reign that which accuses the king three columns which all five different totals
democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of secondary interest the protects of the street violently repressed military execution of insurrections the rising passed over by arm after he means no gain the counsels of war the absorption of the real country by the legal country in half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused algeria too harshly conquered and as in the case of india by the english with more barbarism that civilization the breach of faith to abdelkader blaye debts bought pritchard paid these are the doings of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the king
this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france
whence arises this fault
we will state of
louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed hence excessive timidity which is displeasing to the people who have the th of july in their civil and austerlitz in their military tradition
moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his family was deserved by the family
that domestic group was worthy of admiration
virtues there dwelt side by side with talents
this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is the truth about louis philippe
to be prince equality to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power therein lay the fortune of louis philippe im never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event the one entered into the other and the incarnation took place
louis philippe is made man
moreover he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile
he had been proscribed a wanderer poor
he had lived by his own labor
in switzerland this held to the richest princely domains in france had sold an old horse in order to obtain bread
at reichenau he gave lessons in mathematics while his sister adelaide did will work and sewer
these souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic
he had with his own hands demolished the iron cage of mont saint michel built by louis xi and used by louis xv
de chartres he had witnessed from the depth of a box the trial of louis xvi
so well named that poor tyrant
the blind clairvoyance of the revolution breaking royalty in the king and the king with royalty disco almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea the vast storm of the assembly tribunal the public wrath interrogating capet not knowing what to reply the alarming stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned he had looked on those things he had contemplated that giddiness he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the assembly convention he had be held behind louis xvi
that unfortunate passerby who was made responsible the terrible culprit the monarchy rise through the shadows and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god
they have left in him by the revolution was prodigious
its memory was like a living imprint of those great years minute by minute
one day in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt be rectified from memory the whole of the lettera in the alphabetical list of the constituent assembly
louis philippe was a king of the broad daylight
while he reigned the press was free the tribune was free conscience and speech were free
the laws of september are open to sight
although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges he left his throne exposed to the light
history will do justice to him for this loyalty
louis philippe like all historical men who have passed from the scene is today put on his trial by the human conscience
his case is as yet only in the lower court
the hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent has not yet sounded for him the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king the austere and illustrious historian louis blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict louis philippe was elected by those two almosts which are called the age that is today by a half parliament and a half revolution and in any case from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself we can not judge him here as the reader has seen above except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle in the eyes of the absolute outside these two fights the right of man in the first place the right of the people in the second allis usurpation but what we can say even at the present day that after making these reserves is that to sum up the whole and in whatever manner he is consider rd louis philippe taken in himself and from the point of view of human goodness will remain to use the antique language of ancient history one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne
what is there against him
that throne
take away louis philippe the king there remains the man
and the man is good
he is good at times even to the point of being admirable
often in the midst of his grave at souvenirs after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the congo nem the returned at night to his apartments and there exhausted with fatigue overwhelmed with sleep what did he dk
he took a death sentence and passed the night in devising a criminal suit considering it something to hold his own against europe but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner
he obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals be disputed the ground with the guillotine foot by foot against the crown attorneys those charterers of the law as he called them
sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table he examined them all it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable condemned heads
one day he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred i won seven last night
during the early years of his reign the death penalty was as good as abolished and the erection of a scaffold was a violence committed against the king
the greve having disappeared with the elder branch a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name of the barriers saint jacques practical men felt the necessity of a quasi legitimate guillotine and this was one of the victories of casimir perier who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie over louis philippe who represented its liberal sides
louis philippe annotated beccaria with his own hand
after the fieschi machine he exclaimed what a pity that i was not wounded
then i might have pardoned
on another occasion alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry he wrote in connection with a political criminal who is one of the most generous figures of our day his pardon is granted it only remains for me to obtain it
louis philippe was as gentle as louis ix
and as kindly as henri iv
how to our mind in history where kindness is the rarest of pearls the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great
louis philippe having been severely judged by some harshly perhaps brothers it is quite natural that a man himself a phantom at the present day who knew that king should come and testify in his favor before history this deposition whatever else it may be is evidently and above all things entirely disinterested an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere one shade may console another share the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise if it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile this one flattered the other
he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have been elected king
he had not served this mandate on himself he had not taken if it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in accordance with right and that the qx ceptance of it was in accordance with duty
hence his possession was in good faith
now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king not on the democracy
a clash of principles res wmv iraq clash of elements
the ocean dr fence the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes its suffering today will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is evidently his taken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two stores at once with one foot on the republican done in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than a van de am is a ruffian
let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions
whatever the nature of these tempests may be human it responsibil k this mingled with them
let us complete this exposition
the government of led a hard life immediately
born yesterday it was obliged to fight today
hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid and so lacking in solidity
resistance was born on the morris perhaps even it was born on the preceding evening
from month to month the hostility increased and from being concealed it became patent
the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have said
god delivers over to menu is visible will in events an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue
men immediately make translations of it translations hasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense
very few minds comprehend the divine language
the most sagacious the calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with their test the task has long been completed there are already twenty translations on the public place
from each remaining springs a party and from each his interpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the light
power itself is often a faction
there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are the old parties
for the old parties who cling to heredity by the grace of god think that revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the right to revolt against them
error
for in these revolutions the one who revolts is not the people it is the king
revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt
every revolution being a normal outcome contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives even when stained with blood
revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity
a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real
it is because it must be that it is
nonetheless did the old legiti most parties assail the resolution of with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning
errors make excellent projectiles
they strike it cleverly in its vulnerable spot in default of a cuirass in its lack of logic they attacked this revolution in its royalty
they shouted to it revolution why this king
factions are blind men who aim correctly
this cry was uttered equally by the republicans
but coming from then this cry was logical
what was blindness in the legiti mists was clearness of vision in the democrats
had bankrupted the people
the enraged democracy reproached it with this
between the attack of the past and the attack of the future the establishment of july struggled
it represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries on the other hand with eternal right
in addition and beside all this as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy was obliged to take per cd dence of all europe
to keep the peace was an increase of complication
a harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war
from this secret conflict always muzzled but always growling was born armed peace that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the harness of the european cabinets is suspicious in itself
the royalty of july reared up in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets
metternich would gladly have put it in kicking straps
pushed on in france by progress it pushed on the monarchies those loiterers in europe
after having been towed it undertook to tow
meanwhile within her pauperism the proletariat salary education penal servitude prostitution the bane of the woman wealth misery production consumption division exchange coin credit the rights of capital the rights of labor all these questions were multiplied above society a terrible slope
outside of political parties properly so called another movement became manifest
philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation
the elect felt troubled as well as the masses in another manner but quite as much
thinkers meditated while the soil that is to say the people traversed by revolutionary currents trembled under them with indescribably vague epileptic shocks
these dreamers some isolated others united in families and almost in communion turned over social questions in a pacific but profound manner impassive miners who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano hardly disturbed by the full commotion and the form acts of which they caught glimpses
this tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated epoch
these men left to political parties the question of rights they occupied themselves with the question of happiness
the wellbeing of man that was what they wanted to extract from society
they raised material questions questions of agriculture of industry of commerce almost to the dignity of a religion
in civilization such as it has formed itself a little by the command of god a great deal by the agency of man interests combine unite and amalgamate in a manner to form a veritable hard rock in accordance with a dynamic law patiently studied by economists those geologists of politics
these men who grouped themselves under different appellations but whom shall be designated by the generic title of socialists endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity
from the question of the scaffold to the question of war their works embraced everything
to the rights of man as proclaimed by the french revolution they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child
the reader will not be surprised if for various reasons we do not be retreat in a thorough manner from the theoretical point of view the questions raised by socialism
we confine ourselves to indicating the m
all the problems that the socialist a proposed to themselves to a moronic visions revert and mysticism being cast aside can be reduced to two principal problems
first problem to produce wealth
second problem to share it
the first problem contains the question of work
the second contains the question of salary
in the first problem the employment of forces is in question
in the second the distribution of enjoyment
from the proper employment of forces results public power
from a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness
by avoid distribution not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood
from these two things combined the public power without individual happiness within results social prosperity
social prosperity means the man happy the citizen free the nation great
england solves the first of these two problems
she creates wealth admirably she divides it badly
this solution which is complete on one side only leads her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence monstrous wretchedness
all enjoyments for some all privations for the rest that is to say for the people privilege exception monopoly feudalism born from tool itself
a false and dangerous situation which dates public power or private misery which sets the roots of the state in the sufferings of the individual
a badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters
communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem
they are mistaken
their division kills production
equal partition abolishes emulation and consequently labor
it is a partition made by the butcher which kills that which it divides
it is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions
slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it
the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved
the two problems must be combined and made but one
solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will be england
you will have like venice an artificial power or like england a material power you will be the wicked richman
you will die by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england will fall
and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue of an idea
it is well understood here that by the words venice england we designate not the peoples but social structures the oligarchies superposed on nations and not the nations themselves
the nations always have our respect and our sympathy
venice as a people will live again england the aristocracy will fall but england the nation is immortal
that said we continue
solve the two problems encourage the wealthy and protect the poor suppress misery put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by the strong put a bridle on the ubiquitous jealousy of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached the goal adjust mathematically and fraternally salary to labor mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of child good and make of science the base of manliness develop minds while keeping arms bush beat one and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men render property democratic not by abolishing it but by making it universal so that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor an easier matter than is generally supposed in two words learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it and you will have at once moral and material greatness and you will be worthy to call yourself france
this is what socialism said outside and above a few sects which have gone astray that is what it sought in facts that is what it sketched out in mind s
efforts worthy of admiration
sacred attempts
these doctrines these theories these resistances the unforeseen necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse a new system of politics to be created which shall be in accord with the old world without too much did accord with the new revolutionary idea la situation in which it became necessary to use lafayette to defend polignac the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt the chambers and streets the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him his faith in the revolution perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right his desire to remain of his face his domestic spirit his sincere respect for the people go down honesty preoccupied louis philippe almost painfully and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was he was overwhelm ex by the difficulties of being a king
he felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation which was not nevertheless a reduction to dust france being more france than ever
piles of shadows covered the horizon
a strange shade gradually drawing nearer extended little by little over men over things over odessa share which came from deaths and systems
everything which had been hastily stifled was moving and fermenting
at times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophie ms were in her mingled with truths
spirits trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm
the electric tensions as such that at certain instants the first comer a stranger brought light
then the twilight obscurity closed in again
at intervals deep and full mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud
twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july the year had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening
chapter v facts whence history springs and which history ignores towards the end of april everything had become aggravated
the fermentation entered the billingsgate
ever since petty partial revolts had been going on here and there which were quickly suppressed but ever bursting forth a fresh the sign of a vast underlying conflagration
something terrible was in preparation
glimpses could be caught of the features still in distinct and imperfectly lighted of a possible revolution
france kept an eye on paris paris kept an eye on the faubourg saint an tonne
the faubourg saint antoine which was in a full good was beginning its ebullition
illustrations street orator b street orator the wine shops on the rue de charonne were although the union of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine shops grave and stormy
the government was there purely and simply called in question
there people public in discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet
there were back ships where working men were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm and that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy
this engagement once entered into a man seated in the corner of the wine shop assumed a sonorous tone and said you understand
you have sworn
sometimes they went upstairs to a private room on the first floor and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted
they made the initiated take paths to render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families
that was the formula
in the two rooms subversive pamphlets were read
they treated the government with contempt days a secret report of that time
we folks shall not know the day until two hours before hand
one workman said there are three hundred of islet each contribute geneous that will make one hundred and fifty frames with which to procure powder and shot
in less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government
with twenty five thousand men we can face them
from time to time men of bourgeois appearance and in good costs came and caused embarrassment and with the air of command shook hands with the most important and then went away
they never stayed more than ten minutes
significant remarks were exchanged in a low tone theologis ripe the matter is arranged
it was murmured by all who were there to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present
the exaltation was such that one day a working man exclaimed before the whole wine shop we have no arms
one of his comrades replied the soldiers have
it is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said
these reunions were sometimes periodical
at certain ones of them there were never more than eight or ten persons present and they were always the same
in others anyone entered who wished and the room was so full that they were forced to stand
some went thither through enthusiasm and passion others because it was on their way to their work
as during the revolution there were patriotic women in some of these wine shops who embraced newcomers
other expressive facts came to light
a man would enter a shop drink and to his way with the remark wine merchant the revolution will pay what is due to you
revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine shop facing the rue de charonne
the balloting was carried on in their caps
working men met at the house of a fencing master who gave lessons in the rue de corte
there there was atrophy of arms formed of wooden broadswords canes clubs and tools
one day the buttons were removed from the tools
later on that machine became when is set
the indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety
a woman sweeping off her footsteps said to another woman for a long time there has been a strong force busy making cartridges
in the open street proclamation could be seen addressed to the national guard in the departments
one of these proclamations was signed by rt of wine merchant
one day a man with his beard worn like a dollar and with an italian accent mounted a stone lost at the door of a liquor seller in the marcus lenoir and read aloud a singular document which seemed to emanate from an occult lower
groups formed around him and applauded
the passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and noted down
our doctrines are trammell ed our proclamation storm our hill stickers are spied upon and thrown into prison
the breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many mediums
the future of nations is being worked out in our obscure ranks
here are the fixed terms action or reaction revolution or counter revolution
for a tour epoch we no longer believe either in inertia of in immobility
for the people against the people that is the question
there is no other
on the day when we cease to suit you break usb it up to that day help us to march oh
all this in broad daylight
other deeds more audacious still were suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity
ont meth of april a passerby mounted the lost on the corner which forms the angle of the rue saint e marguerite and shouted i am aba bouvier
but beneath babe if the people scented bosquet
among other things this man said down with property
the opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous
when it wants to be on the right side it preaches revolution it is democratic in order to escape being beaten and royalist so that it may not have to fight
the republicans are beasts with feathers
distrust the republicans citizens of the laboring classes
silence citizen spy
cried an artisan
this shoutout a tend to the discourse
mysterious incidents occurred
at nightfall a working man encountered near the canal a very well dressed man who said to him whither are you found citizen
sir replied the working man i have not the honor of your acquaintance
i know you very well however
you are suspected of not being quite faithful
you know that if you reveal anything there is an eye fixed on you
then he shook hands with the working man and went away saying we shall meet again soon
the police who were on the alert collected singular dialogues not only in the wine shops but in the street
get yourself received very soon said as eager to a cabinet maker
why
there is going to be a shot to fire
two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies fraught with evident jacque die who governs us
m
philippe
no it is the bourgeoisie
the reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word jacque die in an adsense
the jacques were the poor
on another occasion two men were heard today to each other as they passed by we have a good plan of attack
only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men who were crouching in a dutch of the circle of the barrier edit done everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about paris any more
who was theme
menacing obscurity
the principal leaders as they said in the faubourg held themselves apart
it was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine shop near the point saint eustache
a certain aug chief of the society aid for tailors the monde your had the reputation of serving as intermediary central between the leaders and the faubourg saint antoine
nevertheless there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders and no certain facts an invalidate the singular arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before the court of peers who was your leader
i knew of nine and i recognized home
there was nothing but words transparent but vague sometimes idle reports rumors hearsay
other indications cropped up
a carpenter occupied in mailing boards to a fence around the ground on which a house was in process of construction in the rue de re hilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible the following lines the committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections for the different societies
and as a postscript we have learned that there are guns in the rue du faubourg poisson nie reno
visto the number of five or six thousand in the house of a gunsmith in that court
the section owns no arms
what excites the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact that a few paces further on he picked up another paper torn like the first and still more significant of which were produce a facsimile because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents illustration code table b pages cds learn this list by heart
after so doing you will tear it up

the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance
it appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth at one is cement of the society of the rights of man with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections
today when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history we may publish them
it should be added that the foundation of the society of the rights of man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paper was found
perhaps this was only a rough draft
still according to all the remarks and the words according to written notes material facts begin to make their appearance
in the rue pop in court in the house of a dealer in bric a brac there were seized seven sheets or gray paper all folded alike lengthwise and in four these sheets enclosed twenty six squares of this same gray paper folder in the form of a cartridge and a card on which was written the following saltpetre
ounces
sulphur
ounces
charcoal
ounces and a half
water
ounces
the report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell of powder
this package was taken to the police station
it was opened and in it were found two printed dialogues signed lahat to see a song entitled workmen band together and atom box full of cartridges
one artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how warm he was the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat
in a ditch on the boulevard between pere lachaise and the barrier exit done at the most deserted spot some children while playing discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of woods bag containing a bullet mould a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges a wooden bowl in which there were grains of hunting powder and a little cast iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead
towards the hour when working men repose two men were seen to meet between the barrier epic pus and the barriers charenton in a little lane between two walls hear a wine shop in front of which there was a jeu de siam
one drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other
as he was handing it to him he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder camp
he primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan
then the two men parted
a certain gallais afterwards killed in the rue beaubourg in the affair of april boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and twenty four blinds
the government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg
on the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed
the remarkable point about it was that the police were not able to seize a single one
an intercepted letter read the day is not far distant when within four hours by the clock eighty thousand patriots will be under arms
all this fermentation was public one might almost say tranquil
the approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of the government
no singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis which was already perceptible
the bourgeois talked peaceably to the working classes of what was in preparation
they said how is the rising coming along
in the same time in which they would have said how is your wife
a furniture dealer of the rue moreau inquired well when are you going to make the attack
another shopkeeper said the attack will be made soon
i know it
a month ago there were fifteen thousand of you now there are twenty five thousand
he offered his gun and a neighbor offered a small pistol which he was willing to sell for seven france
moreover the revolutionary fever was growing
not a point in paris not in france was exempt from it
the artery was bearing everywhere
like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body the network of secret societies began to spread all over the country
from the associations of the friends of the people which was at the same time public and secret sprang the society of the rights of man which also dated from one of the orders of the day plug lose year of the republican era which was destined to survive even the mandate of the court of assizes which pronounced its dissolution and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following pikes
tocsin

the vagabonds
forward march

the society of the rights of man engendered the society of action
these were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead
other associations sought to rest but themselves from the great mother societies
the members of sections complained that they were torn asunder
thus the gallic society and the committee of organization of the municipalities
thus the associations for the liberty of the press for individual liberty for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes
then the society of equal working men which was divided into these fractions the levellers the communists the reformers
then the army of the bastille sa sort of cohort organized on a military footing four men commanded by a corporal ten by a sergeant twenty by a sub lieutenant forth by a lieutenant there were never more than five men who knew each other
creation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of venice
the central committee which was at the head had two arms the society of action and the army of the bastille s
a legiti most association the chevaliers of fidelity stirred about among these the republican affiliations
it was denounced and repudiated there
the parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities lyons nantes lille marseille sand each had its society of the rights of man the charbonnier e and the free men
all had a revolutionary society which was called the coin purse
we have already mentioned this word
in paris the faubourg saint marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the faubourg saint antoine and the schools were no less moved than the faubourg a
scare in the rue saint hyacinthe and the wine shop of the seven billiards rue des mathurin a saint jacques served as rallying points for the students
the society of the friends of the abc affiliated to the mutualist so dangers and to the coin purse of six met as we have seen in the cafe husain
these same young men assembled also as we have stated already in a restaurant wine shop of the rue monde tour which was called for in the
these meetings were secret
others were as public as possible and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions where was this meeting held
in the rue de la paix
at whose house
in the street
what sections were there
only one
which
the manuel section
who was its leader
i
you are too young to have decided alone upon the golf course of attacking the government
where did your instructions come from
from the central committee
the army was mined at the same time as the population as was proved subsequently by the operations of before luneville and e pinard
they counted on the fifth second regiment on the fifth on the eighth on the thirty seventh and in the twentieth light cavalry
in burgundy and in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree that is to say apple surmounted by a few cap
such was the situation
the faubourg saint antoine more than any other group of the population as we stated in the beginning accentuated this situation and made it felt
that was the sore point
this old faubourg peoples like an ant hill laborious courageous and angry as a hive of beeswax quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult
everything was in a state of ago tation there without any interruption however of the regular work
it is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy
in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic ropes there also exist rare and ardent minds
it is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extreme sheet
the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble for it received the countershock of commercial crises of failures strikes slack seasons all inherent to great political disturbances
in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect
the flow which it deals rebounds upon it
this population full of proud virtue capable to the highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark
whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events it is impossible not to think of the faubourg saint antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of paris that powder house of suffering and ideas
the wine shops of the faubourg antoine which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess historical notoriety
in troublous times people grow intoxicated there more on words that on wine
a sort of prophetic spirit and an act oaths of the future circulates there swelling hearts and enlarging souls
the cabarets of the faubourg saint antoine resemble those taverns of mint and brine erected on the cave of the sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath taverns where the tables were almost tripods and where was drunk what ennius calls the sibylline wine
the faubourg saint antoine is a reservoir of people
revolutionary agitations create fissures there through which trickles the popular sovereignty
this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any other but even when led astray it remains great
we may say if it as of the blind cyclops ingens
savage
let us explain this word
when these bristling men who in the early days of the revolt to inary chaos tattered howling wild with uplifted bludgeon like on high hurled themselves upon ancient paris in an uproar what did they want
they wanted an end to oppression an end to tyranny an end to the sword work for men instruction for the child social sweetness for the woman liberty equality fraternity bread for all the idea for all the eden izing of the world
progress and that holy sweet and good thing progress they claimed in terrible wise driven to extremities as they were half naked club in vista road in their mouths
they were savages yes but the savages of civilization
they proclaimed right furiously they were desirous of only with fear and trembling to force the human race to paradise
they seemed barbarians and they were saviours
they demanded light with the mask of night
facing these men who were ferocious we admit and terrifying but ferocious and terrifying for good ends there are other men smiling embroidered gilded beribboned starred in silk stockings in white plumes in yellow gloves unvarnished shoes who with their elbows on a velvet table beside a marble chimney piece insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past of the middle ages of divine right of fanaticism of innocence of slavery of the death penalty of war glorifying in low tones and with politeness the sword the stake and the scaffold
for our part if we were forced to make a choice be tween the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism we should choose the barbarians
but thank heaven still another choice is possible
no perpendicular fall is necessary in front any more than in the rear
neither despotism not terrorism
we desire progress with a gentle slope
gps takes care of that
chapter vi enjolras and his lieutenants it was about this epoch that enjolras in view of a possible catastrophe instituted a kind of mysterious census
all were present at a secret meeting at the cafe husain
enjolras said hiding his words with a few half enigmatical but significant metaphors it is proper that we should know where we stand and in whom we may count
if combatants are required they must be provided
it can do no harm to have something with which to strike
passersby always have more chance of being bored when there are bulls on the road than when there are none
let us therefore reckon a little on the herd
how many of us are there
there is no question of postponing this task until tomorrow
revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no time to lose
let us mistrust the unexpected
let us not be caught unprepared
we must go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast
this business ought to be concluded today
source trac you will see the polytechnic students
it is their way to go out
today is wednesday
f chilly you will see those of the glaciers will you not
conhecer re has promised me to go to lisp us
there is a perfect swarm and an excellent one there

i will take charge of the sky tour de myself
that arranged everything said source trac
no
what else is there
a very important thing
what is that
asked source trac
the barriers du maine replied enjolras
enjolras remained for a moment as though absorbed in reflection then he resumed at the barbiere di maine there are marble workers painters and journeymen in the studios of sculptors
they are an enthusiastic family but liable to cool off
they are thinking of something else
they are becoming extinguished
they pass their time playing dominoes
there is urgent need that someone should go and talk with them a little bit with firmness
those ashes must be banned into a glow
for that errand i had counted on that abstracted marius who is a good fellow on the whole but he no longer comes to us
i need someone for the barriers du maine
i have no one
what about me
said grant aire
here amu
you
i
you indoctrinated a public and
you warm up hearts that have grown cold in the name of principle
why not
are you good for anything
i have a vague ambition in that direction said grant aire
you do not believe in everything
i believe in you
grant wire will you do me a service
anything
sleep yourself sober from your absinthe
you are aging rate enjolras
you the man to go to the barriers du maine
you capable of it
i am capable of that
my shoes are capable of that
not much
we only address each other as thou
what will you say to them
i will speak to them of robespierre parsi
of canton

when i set about it i am terrible
i have read prudhomme i know the social contract i know my constitution of the year two by heart
i have an old bank bill of the republic in my drawer
the rights of man the sovereignty of the people capris to
i am even a bit of a hebert ist
i can talk the most superb twaddle for six hours by the flock watching and
be serious said enjolras
i am wild replied grant site
enjolras meditated for a few moments and made the gesture of a man who has taken a resolution
grant sure he said gravely i consent to try you
you shall go to the barriers du maine
grant wife lived in furnished lodgings very near the cafe husain
he went out and five minutes later he returned
he had gone home to put on a robespierre waistcoat
red said he as he entered and he looked intently at enjolras
then with the palm of his energetic hand he laid the two scarlet points of the waistcoat across his breast
and stepping up to enjolras he whispered in his ear be easy
he jammed his hat on resolutely and departed
a quarter of an hour later the backroom of the cafe husain was deserted
all the friends of the abc were gone each in his own direction each to his own task
enjolras who had reserves the coin purse of aid for himself was the last to leave
those members of the coin purse of six who were in paris then met on the plain of issy in one of the abandoned quarries which are so numerous in that side of paris
as enjolras walked towards this place he passed the whole situation in review in his own mind
the gravity of events was self evident
when facts the premonitory symptoms of latent social malady more heavily the slightest complications tops and entangled them
a phenomenon whence arises ruin and new births
enjolras descried a luminous uplifting beneath the gloomy skirts of the future
who knows
perhaps the moment was at hand
the people were again taking possession of right and what a fine spectacle
the revolution was again majestically taking possession of france and saying to the world the sequel tomorrow
enjolras was content
the furnace was being heated
he had at that moment a powder train of friends scattered all over paris
all hands to work
surely the result would answer to the effort
this was well
this made him think of grant aire
hold said he to himself the barriers dumaine will not take me far out of my way
let us have a look at what grant wire is about and see how he is getting on
he pushed open the door entered folded his arms letting the door fall gland strike his shoulders and gazed at that room filled with tables men and smoke
a voice broke forth from the most of smoke interrupted by another voice
it was grant site holding a dialogue with an adversary
grant site was sitting opposite another figure at a marble saint anne table strewn with grains of brag and dotted with dominos
he was hammering the table with his fist and this is what enjolras heard double six

book second
marius betook himself to source trac
source trac was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la verne die for political reasons this quarter was one where at that epoch insurrection liked to install itself
markus said to source track have come to sleep with you
source trac dragged a mattress off his bed which was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said there
who would ever have said it
she exclaimed to the port red sea of the quarter a young man like that who had the air of a girl
marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence
the first was that he now had a horror of that house where he had be held so close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious developments social deformity which is perhaps even more terrible than the wicked richman the wicked poorman
the second was that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would incur in all probability and be brought into testify against the man dies
javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home at the time of the ambush he made some efforts to find him however but without success
a month passed then another
marius was still with source trac
he had learned from a young licentiate in las an habitual frequented of the courts that the barrier was in close confinement
as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five france from four be trac
it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money
these periodical five france were a double riddle to court eurac who lent and to the barriers to received them
to whom can they go
thought source trac
e hence can this come home
the barrier asked himself
moreover marius was heartbroken
everything had plunged through a trap door once more
he no longer saw anything before him his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered dumbly ugly
he had for a moment be held very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl whom he loved the old man who seemed to be her father thoas unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world and at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping the marist had swept all these shadows away
not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions
no conjecture was possible
he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew
it certainly was not ursule
and the park was a nickname
and what waste to think of the old man
was he actually in hiding from the police
the white haired work man whom marius had encountered in the vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind
it now seemed probable that that working man and m
leblanc were one and the same person
some disguised himself
that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides
why had he not called for help
why had he fled
waste of waste not the father of the young girl
waste in short the man whom the barrier thought that he recognized
thenardier might have been mistaken
these formed so many insoluble problems
all this it is true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg
heartrending distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes
he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir
all had vanished save love
of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations
ordinarily this flame which burns us lights is also a little and casts some useful gleams without
but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion
he never said to himself what if i were to go to such a place
what if i were to try such and such a thing
the girl whom he could no longer call ursule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her
his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable for
to see her once again he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it
to crown all his poverty had returned
he felt that icy breath close to him on his heels
in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and notting is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes
a habit which is easy to get rid of and difficult to take up again
a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic indiscreet costs
it pulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirits soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over harsh contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas
but too much dreaming sinks and crowns
woe to the brain worker who allows himself to fall entirely from though hint of every
he thinks that he can be a scene with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same thing
error
thought is the toil of the intelligencer every its voluptuousness
to replace thought with revert is to confound a poison with a good
marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember
passion had supervenes and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaeras without object or bottom
idle production
tumultuous and stagnant gulf
and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase
this is a law
man in a state off every is generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind can not hold life within close bounds
there is in that mode of life good mingled with evil for i denervation is baleful generosity is good and healthful
but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost
resources are exhausted needs crop up
fatal declivity town which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holes suicide or crime
excess of revert breeds men like e scouse randle bras
marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw
what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true
the memory of an absent being kindled in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and desk during soul sees this light on its horizon the star of the inner night
he hesitated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible coat and that his new coat was growing old that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself if i could hit see her once again before iris
one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still loved him perhaps
who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her
sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming home
then he added perhaps my thoughts teach her also
this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul
from time to time especially at that evening tour which is the most depressing to even the dream the allowed the purest the most impersonal the most ideal if there series which filled his brain to fall upon a notebook which contained nothing else
he called this writing to her
it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged
quite the contrary
he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more clear sightedness and rectitude than ever
marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most in different deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest rejection and candid disinterested news
his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared in high
in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny
happy even in the midst of anguish is me to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness
he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true
the soul which lives and suffers is in a state of sublimity
however day followed day and nothing new presented itself
it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant
he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abuse
what
he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then
when you have ascended the rue saint jacques left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach the rue de la sante then the glaciers and a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris where guys feel would be tempted to sit down
with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid poplar trees women voice slaughter on the horizon the pantheon the pole of the deaf mutes the calder race black squat fantastic amusing magnificent and in the background the severe squares tests of the towers of notre dame
as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither
hardly one cart or wagoner passed in a quarter of an hour
that day there was a rarity in the boulevard a passerby
marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this passerby what is the game of this spot
and he added it was here that up bach killed the shepherdess of ivey
but after the word park marius heard nothing more
these sudden congeal ments in the state of revert which a single word suffices to evoke do occur
the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else
stop said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides this is her meadow
i shall know where she lives now
it was absurd but irresistible
and every day he returned to that meadow of the park
in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety is very had not taken the prisoner prisoner
the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this person age who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians would be no less done a prize for the authorities
and then montparnasse had escaped javert
montparnasse had in fact encountered eponine as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and has led her off preferring to play be morin with the daughter rather than schinder hannes with the father
it was well that he did so
he was free
as for eponine javert had caused her to be seized a mediocre consolation
eponine has joined a selma at les made lone tree
and finally in the way from the goffeau house to la force one of the principal prisoners claque so he had been lost
it was not known how this has been effected the police agents and the sergeants could not understand it at all
he had converted mom self into vapor he had slipped through the handcuffs he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage the fiacre was cracked and he had fled all that they were able to say was that on arriving at the prison there was no clashes ous
either the fairies of the police had had a hand knit
had claque so is melted into the shadows like a snowflake in water
mad there been in avowed connivance of the police agents
did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder
waste concentric with infraction and repression
