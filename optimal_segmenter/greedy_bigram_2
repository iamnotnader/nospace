my riel in m
charles francois bienvenu my riel was bishop of dhew as an old man of about seventy five years of age he had occupied the see of dsi nce
although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous if merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese
true or false that which is said of men often occupies a sim portant aplac ein the irl ives and above all in the ird est in ies as that which the yd o
m
my riel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of a ix hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar
it was said that his father destin in ghi mto beth ehe iro fhi sown post had married him at avery early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families
inspite of this marriage however it was said that charles my riel created a great deal of talk
he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry
the revolution came events succeeded eachother with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed
m
charles my riel emigrated to italy atthe very beginning of the revolution
the re his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered
he had no children
what to ok place next in the fate of m
my riel
the ruin of the french society of the old end ays the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of ' which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed the mfr oma distance with the magnifying power softer ror did the sec aus ethe ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him
was he inthe midst of the sedis traction sthe sea ffe ctions which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blow sw hich sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart aman who mpu blic catastrophe sw ould not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune
noone could have to lda llt hat was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest
in m
my riel was the cure of bbr ign olle s
he was already advanced in years and lived in avery retired manner
about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his curacy just what is not precisely known to ok him to paris
among other powerful person stow hom he went to solicit a idf or his parishioners was m
lec ard in a lfe sch
one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle the worthy cure who was waiting in the anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed
napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this oldman turned round and said abruptly who is this goodman who is staring at me
sire said m
my riel you are looking at a good man and iata great man
each of us can profit by it
that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and sometime after wards m
my riel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of dwh at truth was the rea fter all in the stories which were invented a sto the early portion of m
my riel 's life
noone knew
very few families had been acquainted with the myr ie lfa mil ybe for ether evolution
m
my riel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in alittle to wnw here there are many mouth sw hich talk and very few heads which think
he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop
but after all the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only noise saying swords less than words pala bres as the energetic language of the south express esi t
however that maybe after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in dall the stories and subject sofc on versa tion which engross petty to wns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion
noone would have dared to mention the mno one would have dared to recall the m
m
my riel had arrived at dacc omp an ied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptist in ewh owa shi ssis teran dte nye ars his junior
the iron lyd ome stic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle baptist in eand name dma dame magloire who after having been the servant of m
lec uren owa ssu med the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur
mademoiselle baptist in ewa salon gpa let hinge ntl ecre atures here alized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for its eem sth at a woman must needs beam other inorder to be venerable
she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but as ucce ssion of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her as orto fpa llo rand transparency and as she advanced in years she had acquired what maybe called the beauty of goodness
what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this dia phan eit yall owed the angel to be seen
she was a soul rather than a virgin
her persons eem edma de of asha do wthe re was hardly sufficient body toprovide for sex alittle matter enclosing a light large eyes forever drooping amer epr etext for a soul 's remaining on the earth
madame magloire was alittle fat white old woman corpulent and bustling always out of breath in the first place because of her activity and in the next because of her asthma
on his arrival m
my riel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop immediately after a major general
the mayor and the president paid the first call on him and he int urn paid the first call on the general and the prefect
the installation over the town waited to see it sbi shop at work
chapter ii m
my riel becomes m
welcome the episcopal palace of dad join sthe hospital
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m
henri puget doctor of the ology of the faculty of paris abbe of simo re who had been bishop of din
this palace was a genuine sei gno rial residence
everything about it had a grand air the apartment soft he bishop the drawing room sthe chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcade sin the old florentine fashion and garden spla nte dwi thm agni fice ntt rees
in the dining room along and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the garden sm
henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles bru lart degen lisa rchb is hop prince d' embrun antoine de mes grig nyt he capuchin bishop of grass eph il ipp ed even dome grand prior off rance abbe of saint honore de le rins francois de berton dec rill on bishop baron de vence cesar des abra ndef or cal qui erbi shops eign or of gland eve and jeans oan en priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishops eign or of sen ez
the portrait soft he sese ven reverend person ages decorated this apartment and this memorable date the tho fj uly was the reen grave din letters of gold on a table of white marble
the hospital was a low and narrow building of asin gles to ry with a small garden
three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital
the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house
monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you atthe present moment
twenty six monseigneur
that was the number which icount eds aid the bishop
the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other
that is what i observed
the halls are not hing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in the m
so it seems to me
and the nw he nthe reis ara yof sun the garden is very small for the convalescent s
that was what is a idt omy self
incase of epidemics wehave had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at times we know not what to do
that is the thought which occurred to me
what would you have monseigneur
said the director
one must resign on e 's self
this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the ground floor
the bishop remained silent for a moment the nhe turned abruptly to the director of the hospital
monsieur said he howmany beds do you think this hall alone would hold
monseigneur 's dining room
exclaimed the stupefied director
the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes
it would hold full twenty beds said he ast hough speaking to himself
the nra is in ghi svo ice hold monsieur the director of the hospital iwill tell you something
the reise vide ntl yami stake here

the rear eth re eof usher eand wehave room for sixty
the reiss ome mistake it elly ou you have myhouse and ihave your s
give me back myhouse you are at home here
onthe following day the thirty six patients were installed in the bishop 's palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital
m
my riel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution
his sister was in receipt of a year lyin come off ive hundred francs which suffice dfor her personal want sat the vicarage
m
my riel received from the state in his quality of bishop as a la ryo ffi ftee nth ousa ndf ran cs
onthe very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m
my riel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner

m
my riel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of dasha sbe ense en he called it regulating his household expenses
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptist in e
this holy woman regarded monseigneur of dasa to nea ndt he sametime her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church
she simply love dan dve nera ted him
when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her adherence
the iron lys e rva nt madame magloire grumbled alittle
it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptist in emad efi ftee nhu ndr edf ran csa year
onthe sefi ftee nhu ndr edf ran cst he set wool dwo menand the old man subsisted
and when avilla gec urate came to dthe bishops till found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptist in e
one day after he had been in dabo utt hree months the bishops aidan dst illiam quite cramped with it all
is hould think so
exclaimed madame magloire
monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage into wna ndf or his journey sabo utt he diocese
it was customary for bishops in former days
hold
cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire
and he made his demand
sometime after wards the general council took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading allowance to m
the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visit s
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and as ena to rof the empire afor me rme mber of the council of the five hundred which favored the brum air eand who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of dwr ote to m

those who had an dth ose who lacked knocked at m
my riel 's door the latter in search of the alms which the former came to deposit
in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress
considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities
far from it
as the reis always more wretchedness below than the reis brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received
it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money here ceived he never had any
the nhes tripped himself

chapter iii aha rd bishopric for a good bishop the bishop did not omit his pastoral visit sbec aus eheh adco nve rted his carriage into a lms
the diocese of disa fatiguing one
the rear every few plains and agreat many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen thirty two cura cies for tyo nevi cars hips and two hundred and eight yf ive auxiliary chapel s
to visit all the seis quite a task
the bishop managed to do it
he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted spring cart when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains
the two old women accompanied him
when the trip was too hard for the mhe went alone
one day hear rived at sen ez which is an ancient episcopal city
he was mounted on an ass
his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him anyother equipage
the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes
some of the citizens were laughing around him
monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens ip erc eiv eth at is hock you
you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ
ihave done so from necessity ias sure you and not from vanity
in the course of the set rips he was kinda ndi nd ul genta ndt al ked rather than preached
he never went far in search of his arguments and his example s
he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of an eigh boring district
in the cantons where the yw ere harsh to the poor he said look at the people of brian con
the yha veco nfer red on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have the irm ead ows mown three days in advance of everyone else

therefore it is a country which is blessed by god
for a whole century there has not been asin gle murderer among the m
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun
if at the harvest season the father of a family has his son away on service in the army and his daughter sat service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommend shim to the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the village men women and children goto the poor man 's field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his grain to his granary
to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of dev olny acount rys owi ldt hat the nightingale is not heard the reon cei nfi ft yy ears
well when the father of a family dies the boys go off to see kthe irf or tunes leaving the property to the girls so that the yma yf in dhu sba nds
to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined the mse lve sins tamped paper he said look at those good peasants in the valley of que yr as

it is like alittle republic
neither judge nor bailiff is known there
the mayor does everything
he allots the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritance swith out charge pronounce ssen tences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men
to villages where he found no school master he quoted on cem or ethe people of que yr as do you know how they manage
he said

but what a disgrace to be ignorant
do like the people of que yr as
thus he discourse dgr ave lya ndp at erna lly in default of examples hein vented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic for me dthe real eloquence of jesus christ
and being convinced himself he was persuasive
chapter iv works corresponding to words his conversation was gay and affable
he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed the irl ives beside him
when he laughed it was the laugh of a school boy
madame magloire like dto call him your grace votre grandeur
one day hero sef rom his armchair and went to his library in search of a book
this book was on one of the upper shelves
as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it
madame magloire said he fetch me a chair
my great ness grandeur does not reach a sfar as that she lf
one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lora rely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons
she had numerous relative sw how erev ery old and near to death and of whom he rso nswere the natural heirs
the youngest of the three was to receive from a grand aunt ago odh und red thousand livres of income these cond was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather
the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to the sein no cent and pardonable maternal boasts
on one occasion however heap peared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de low as relating once again the details of all the sein her it ances and all the see xp ect ations
she interrupted her self impatiently mon dieu cousin
what are you think i nga bout

' at another time on receiving an oti fication of the decease of agent leman of the countryside where in not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page what a stout back death has
he exclaimed
what astra nge burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much wit must men have inorder thus to press the tomb in to the service of vanity
he was gifted on occasion with agent lera iller yw hich almost always concealed as eri ous meaning
in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to dan dpr each edin the cathedral
he was tolerably eloquent
the subject of his sermon was charity
he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable
among the audience there was a wealth yr et ired merchant who was somewhat of a us ure rna med m
gebo rand who had amassed two million sin them an ufa ctu re ofc oars ecl oth serge sand woollen gallo on s
never in his whole life had m
gebo rand bestowed a lms on any poor wretch
after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a so ue very sunday to the poor old beggar women at the door of the cathedral
the re were six of the mto share it
one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m
gebo rand purchasing paradise for a so u
when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection
once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room of the town there was present the marquis de champ terc ie raw ealth yand avaricious oldman who contrived to be at one and the same time an ultra royalist and an ultra volta irian
this variety of man has actually existed
when the bishop came to him he touched his army oum us tgi vem eso meth in gm

the marquis turned round and answered dryly ihave poor people of my own monseigneur
give the mtom ere plied the bishop
one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral my very dear brethren my goodfriend sthe rear eth irt een hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in france which have butt hree opening sei ght een hundred and seventeenth ousa nd hovels which have butt woop ening sthe door and one window and three hundred and for tys i xth ousa ndc abi nsbe sides which have but one opening the door

he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains
he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms
ashes poke all tongue she entered into all hearts
moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes
he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances in to account
he said examine the road over which the fault has passed
being a shed escribe dhi msel fwi tha smile an ex sinner he had no neo fthe as per it ies of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinct ness and without the frown of the ferocious ly virtuous adoc trine which may be summed up as follows man has upon him his flesh which is a ton ceh is burden and his temptation
he drags it with him and yields to it
he must watch it check it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity
the rema ybe some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer
to be asain tis the exception to be an upright man is the rule
err falls in ifyou will but be upright
the least possible sin is the law of man
no sin at all is the dream of the angel
all which is terrestrial is subject to sin
sinisa gravitation
when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh
oh
he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits
the sea re hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter
he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest
he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husband sthe father sthe masters the strong the rich and the wise
he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces
this soul is full of shadows in isthe rein committed
the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things is us pect that he obtained it from the gospel
one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and onthe point of trial discussed in a drawing room
a wretched man being a tthe end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and forth ech il dwh ich he had had by her
counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch
the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man
she was held but there were no proof sex cept against her
she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession
she denied the yin sisted
she persisted in her denial
the re upon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown
he invented an infidelity on the part of the love rand succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her
the re upon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all
the man was ruined
he was shortly to be tried at a ix with his accomplice
the yw ere relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate
by bringing jealousy in to play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educ edt he just ice of revenge
the bishop listened to all this in silence
when the yha dfi nished he inquired where are this man and woman to be tried
atthe court of assizes
he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried
at rag ice vento ccu rre dat daman was condemned to death for murder
he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been amount eban kat fair sand awr it erf or the public
the town to oka great interest in the trial
onthe eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill
apr ies twas needed to attend the criminal in his last moments
the ys ent for the cure
it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine
ihave nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mount eban kit ooa milland besides it is not myplace
this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right it is not his place it is mine
he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell ofthe mount eban kcal led him by name to ok him by the hand and spoke to him
he passed the entire day with him for get ful of food and sleep praying to go dfor the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own
he told him the best truth sw hich are also the most simple
he was father brother friend he was bishop only to bless
he taught him everything encouraged and console dhi m
the man was on the point of dying in despair
death was an abyss to him
ashes to odt re mb lingo nits mournful brink here coiled with horror
he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent
his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through her eand the retha twa llw hich separate sus from the mystery of things and which we call life
he gazed incessantly beyond this world through the sef at a lbr each esa ndb ehe ldo nly darkness
the bishop made him see light
onthe following day when the yca met of etch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there
he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple cam aila nd with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords
he mounted the tumb ril with him he mounted the scaffold with him
the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant
he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god
the bishop embraced him and atthe moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him go drais esf rom the dead him who mma nsl a ys he who mhi sbr other shaver ejected find shi sfa the ron cem or e
pray believe enter into life the father is the re
when he descended from the scaffold the rewa sso meth in gin his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass
the ydi dno tkn oww hich was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity
on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister ihave just officiated pontifical ly
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood the re were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation
this however was a remark which was confined to the drawing room s
the populace which perceive sno jest in holy deeds was touched and admired him
as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was along time before her ecover edf rom it
infact when the scaffold is the real le rected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination
one may feel acer tain indifference to the death penalty on ema yr efrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no solo nga son eha snot seen a guillotine with one 's own eyes but if one encounters one of the mthe shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against
some admire it like dema is treo the rse xe crate it like beccaria
the guillotine is the concretion of the law itis called vind ict eit is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral
he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers
all social problems erect the irin terr oga tion point around this chopping knife
the scaffold is a vision
the scaffold is not apiece of carpentry the scaffold is not amach in ethe scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords
it seems as though it were a being possessed of iknow not what sombre initiative on ewo uld say that this piece of carpenter 's work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and the secord swer epos sessed of will
in the frightful meditation in to which it spre sence cast sthe soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and as though taking part in what is going on
the scaffold is the accomplice of the execution erit devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter aspect re which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed
the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him
he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself
at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice
this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved id id not think that it was so monstrous
it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law
death belongs to go dal one
by what right dome nto uch that unknown thing
in course of time the sei mpre ssion swe aken edan dpr oba bly vanished
nevertheless it was observed that the bishop the nce for tha voided passing the place of execution
m
my riel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying
he did not ignore the fact that the rein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor
widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord
he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child
as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech
ohad mira ble console r
he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope
he said have a car eof the manner in which you turn towards the dead
think not of that which perishes
gazes tea dil y
you will perceive the living light of your well beloved dead in the depths of heaven
he knew that faith is wholesome
he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him there signed man and to transform the grief which gazes upon agrave by showing him the grief which fixes it sga zeu pon as tar

my riel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life
the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of dlive dwo uld have been a solemn and charming sight for anyone who could have viewed it close at hand
like all oldmen and like the majority of thinkers he slept little
this brief slumber was profound
in the morning he meditated for an hour the nhes aid his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house
his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows
the nhes et to work

charges to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state onthe other the holy see and at hous and matters of business
what time was left to him after the set hous and details of business and his office sand his breviary he bestowed first onthe neces sito us the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the neces sito us he devoted to work
sometimes he dug in his garden again here ador wrote
he had but one word for both the seki nds of toil he called the mga rd ening
the mind is a garden said he
towards midday when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or into wno fte nent erin glow lyd well in gs
he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long can ecl adin his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points
it was a perfect festival where ver heap peared
one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it
the children and the old people came out to the doorstep sfor the bishop as for the sun
he bestowed his blessing and the yb less ed him

on his return hedin ed
the dinner resembled his breakfast
at half past eight in the evening he supped with his sister madame magloire standing behind the man dse rving the matta ble
nothing could be more frugal than this repast
if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire to oka dva nta geo fthe opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains
every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal the bishop did not interfere
with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oils oup
thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure he indulge sin the cheer of a trappist
after supper he converse dfor half an hour with mademoiselle baptist in eand madame magloire the nhe retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio
he was a man of letters and rather learned
he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others adis serta tion on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated up on the water s
with this verse he compares three texts the arabic verse which says the wind so fg odb lew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chal dai cpa rap hras eof on kelo sw hich renders it a wind coming from god blew up on the face of the water s
in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of pto lema is great grand uncle to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little work spu blish edd uring the last century under the pseudonym of barley court
sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation when ceh eon lye merged to write a few lines on the page soft he volume itself

toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to the irc ham berson the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor
it is necessary that we should inthis place give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of dcha pter vi who guarded his house for him the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of aground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above
behind the house was a garden aqua rte rof an acre in extent
the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below
the first room opening on the streets erv ed him as diningroom the second was his bedroom and the third his or at or y
the rewa sno exit possible from this oratory except bypassing through the bedroom nor from the bedroom with out passing through the dining room
atthe end of the suite in the oratory the rewa sade tached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality
the bishop of fered this bed to country curates who mbus in esso rthe requirements of the irpa rish esb rough tto dthe pharmacy ofthe hospital as mall building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar
inaddition to this there was in the garden as table which had formerly been the kitchen ofthe hospital and inwhich the bishop kept two cows
no matter what the quantity of milk the yg ave he invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital
iam paying my tithes he said
his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather
as wood is extremely dear at dhe hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cows he d
here he passed his evenings during season so fse vere cold he called it his winter salon
in this winter salon asin the dining room there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four straws eat edc hair s
inaddition to this the dining room was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted pink in watercolor s
out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white naper yand imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his or at or y
his wealth ype nite nts and the saint ed women of dha dmo retha non ceas sessed themselves to raise the money for an ewalt arf or monseigneur 's oratory one acho ccas ion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor
the most beautiful of altars he said isthe soul of an unhappy creature console dan dth an king god
in his or at or ythe re were two straw pried ieuan dthe re was an armchair also in straw in his bedroom
when by chance here ceived seven or eight persons at one time the prefect or the general or the staff of the regiment in garrison or several pupils from the little seminar ythe chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable the pried ie ufr omt he oratory and the armchair from the bedroom in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors
aro om was dismantled for each new guest
it sometimes happen edt hat there were twelve in the party the bishop the nrel ie ved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer
the rewa sst ill another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall
mademoiselle baptist in ehad also in her own room avery large easy chair of wood which had formerly been gilded and which was covered with flower edp ekin but the yha dbe en obliged to hoist this berger eu pto the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture
mademoiselle baptist in e 's ambition had been to be able to purchase as et of drawing room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in swan 's neck style with a sofa
but this would have cost five hundred francs atleast and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty two francs and tens ous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by renouncing the idea
however who is the re who has attained his ideal
nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishop 's bedchamber

the book case was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire
in the chimney stood a pair of fire dog so fir on ornamented above with two garland ed vases and fluting sw hich had formerly been silver ed with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the chimney piece hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen near the glass door ala rge table with an in ks tan dlo ade dwi tha confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table ana rmc hair of straw in front of the bed apr ie die ubo rro wed from the oratory

madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered the sepa rti cular swri tte nin whitish in kona little square of paper yellow ed by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of grand champ with four wafers
at his window heh adana nti que curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that inorder to avoid the expense of an ew one madame magloire was forced to take a large sea mint hever ym id dle of it
this seam to okt he form of across
the bishop of ten called attention to it how delightful that is
he said
all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor aswell as those on the first floor were whitewashed which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals
however inthe irl at ter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornament in gthe apartment of mademoiselle baptist in eas we shall see further on
before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois
hence this decoration
the chamber swer epa vedi nre dbr ick sw hich were washed every week with straw mats in front of all the beds
altogether this dwelling which was attended to bythe two women was exquisite lyc lean from top to bottom
this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted
he said that takes nothing from the poor
it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possession ssi xsi lve rk nive sand for ksa ndas oup ladle which madame magloire contemplated everyday with delight as the yg listened splendidly upon the coarse line ncl oth
and since we are now painting the bishop of dash ewa sin reality we must add that he had said more than once if i ndi tdi ffi cult to renounce eating from silver dishes
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from agreat aunt
the sec and lest i cks held two wax candles and usually figure dont he bishop 's chimney piece
when he had anyone to dinner madame magloire light edt he two candles and set the candlesticks on the table
in the bishop 's own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and for ksa ndt hebig spoon everynight
but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed
the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly building sw hich wehave mentioned was composed of four alleys in cross for mrad iat in gfr oma tank
another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it
the sea lle y sle ft behind the mfo urs quare plots rimmed with box
in three of the sema dame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and the rest ood afew fruit trees
madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot
it would be better to grow salads the retha nbo uq uet s
madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken
the beautiful is a suse fula sthe useful
head de daft era pause more soper haps
this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books
he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming hoeing and making holes here and the rein the earth into which he dropped seeds
he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him
moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tour nef or tan dthe natural method het ook part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus
he did not study plants he loved flowers
here spec ted learned men great lyh eres pected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in the set wore spec tsh ewa tered his flowerbeds every summer evening with a tin watering pot painted green
the house had not as in gle door which could be locked
the door of the dining room which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison
the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch
all that the first pass erb yha dto do at any hour was to give it apus h
at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de dha dsa id to the mha veb olt spu to nyo urr ooms if that will please you
the yha den de dby sharing his confidence or by atleast acting as though the ys haredi t
madame magloire alone had fright sfr omt imet oti me
as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or atleast indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priests hould always be open
on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note am not iap hys icia nli ket he m

the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custo die rit do mum in van um vigilant qui custo di un team unless the lord guard the house in vain doth eyw at chw hog uar dit
the nhes poke of something else
he was fond of saying there is a brave ryo fthe priest aswell as the bravery of a colonel of dragoon son lyh ead de dour smu st be tranquil

his highway robberies laid waste the countryside
the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain
he always escaped sometimes here sisted by main force
he was a bold wretch
in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived
he was making his circuit to chaste la r
the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps

he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide

while the yw ere thus embarrassed ala rge chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horsemen who departed on the instant
the chest was opened it contained a cope of cloth of gold amit re ornamented with diamonds anarch bishop 's cross am a gni fice ntc rosie rall the pontifical vestments which had been stolen amon th previously from the treasury of notre dame d' embrun

the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god
when he returned to chaste lart he people came out to stare at him as a tac uri osi tya lla long the road

those are dangers from without petty dangers
let us fear ourselves

the great danger sli ewi thin ourselves
what matters it what threatens our head or our purse
let us think only of that which threatens our soul
the ntu rning to his sister sister never apr eca ution on the part of the priest against his fellow man
that which his fellow does god permits
let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that ada nger is approaching us
let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account
however such incidents were rare in his life
were late those of which we know but generally hepa ssed his life in doing the same thing sat the same moment
one month of his year resembled one hour of his day
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate
stolen the yha dal ready been elsewhere
half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor
however we make no assertions on this point
only a rather obscure not ewa sfo und among the bishop 's paper sw hich maybe a rso mere lation to this matter and which is couched in the set erms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital

and head de dde epi nhis own mind iow ehi mavis it
but let us avow it this idea which seemed natural atthe first blush appeared to him after a moment 's reflection as strange impossible and almost repulsive
for a tbo tto mhe shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is sowell expressed by the word estrangement
still should the scab of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil
no
but what ashe ep
the good bishop was perplexed
sometimes he set out in that direction the nhe returned
finally the rumor one day spread through the town that as orto fy oung shepherd who served the member of the convention in his hovel had come in questo fado ctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live overnight
thank god
some added
the bishop to ok his staff put on his cloak on account of his tooth read bare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out
the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot
with a certain beating of the heart here cogni zed the fact that he was near the lair
he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered an egle cted paddock to oka few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the wasteland and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern
it was avery low hut poor small and clean with a vine nailed against the outside
near the door in an old wheelchair the armchair of the peasants the rewa saw hit eha ired man smiling at the sun
near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd lad
he was offering the old man ajar of milk
while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke thankyou he said in eed nothing
and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child
the bishops tep ped forward
atthe sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sumtotal of the surprise which aman can still feel after along life
this is the first time since i have been here said he that anyone has entered here
who are you sir
the bishop answered my name is bienvenu my riel
bienvenu my riel
ihave heard that name
are you the man who mthe people call monseigneur welcome
iam
the old man resume dwi tha half smile in that case you are my bishop
something of that sort
enter sir
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
the bishop confined himself to the remark iam please dto see that ihave been misinformed
you certainly do not seem to me to be ill
monsieur replied the old man iam going to recover
he paused and the nsaid is hall diet hree hours hence
the nhe continued iams ome thing of a doctor iknow in what fashion the last hour draws on
yesterday only my feet were cold today the chill has ascended to my knees now if eel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart is hall stop
the sun is beautiful is it not
i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things
you can talk to me it does not fatigue me
you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death
it is well that the res hould be witnesses at that moment
one has one 's caprice sis hould have liked to last until the dawn but i know that is hall hardly live three hours
it will be night the n
what does it matter after all
dying is a simple affair
one has no need of the light for that
so be it
is hall die by starlight
the old man turned to the shepherd lad goto thy bed thou wert awake all lastnight thou art tired
the child entered the hut
the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself is hall die while he sleeps
the two slumber sma ybe good neighbors
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been
he did not think he discerned godin this manner of dying let us say the whole forth ese petty contradictions of great heart smu st be indicated like the rest he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at no tbe in gadd res seda smo nse ign eur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen
he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him
this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe
meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished possibly that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust
the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach in connection with any other man
ame mber of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even ofthe law of charity
gcal mhi sbo dy almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarian sw hof or mth esu bject of astonishment to the physiologist
the revolution had many of the semen proportion edt othe epoch
in this oldman one was conscious of a man put to the proof
though so near to his end he preserved all the gestures of health
in his clear glance in his firm to nein the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to disco ncert death
azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door
gsee med to be dying because he will edit so
the rewa sfr eed omi nhis agony
his legs alone were motionless
it was the retha tthe shadows held him fast
his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light
gatt his solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below
the rewa sast one there
the bishops at down
the ex or dium was abrupt
icon grat ulate you said he inthe to new hich one uses for a reprimand
you did not vote for the death of the king after all
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
here plied
the smile had quite disappeared from his face
don otc on grat ulate met oom uch sir
id id vote for the death of the tyrant
it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity
what do you mean to say
resume dthe bishop
ime an tosa yth at man has a tyrant ignorance
i voted for the death of that tyrant
that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority right ly understood
man should be governed only by science
and conscience added the bishop
it is the same thing
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very new to him
the member of the convention resume dso far as louis xvi
was concerned is a id ' no
' id id not think that i had the right to kill a man but if elt it my duty to exterminate evil

i voted for fraternity concord the dawn

the crumbling away of prejudice sander rors causes light
wehave caused the fall of the old world and the old world that vase of miseries has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy

you may say trouble dj oya ndt oday after that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared

the mill is the reno longer the wind is still there
you have demolished
it may be of use to demolish but i distrust adem olit ion complicated with wrath
right has its wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress
in any case and inspite of whatever may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
incomplete it may be but sublime
it set free all the unknown social quantities its often eds piri tsi tca lme dapp ease den lightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth
it was a good thing
the french revolution is the consecration of humanity
the bishop could not refrain from murmuring yes
'
the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed sofa rasa dying man is capable of exclamation a hthe re you go '
iwas expecting that word
acl oud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst
you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something with in him had suffered extinction
nevertheless he put a good face on the matter
here plied the judges peaks in the name of justice the priests peaks in the name of pity which is not hing but amore lofty justice
at hunde rbo lts hould commit noerror
and head de dreg ard in gthe member of the convention steadily the while louis xvi i
the convention ary stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishop 's arm
louis xvi i
let us see
for whom do you mourn
is it for the innocent child
very good in that case imo urn with you
is it for the royal child
idem and time for reflection
to me the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv
an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv
monsieur said the bishop il ike not this conjunction of names
cartouche
louis xv
to which of the two do you object
amo mentary silence ensued
the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken

another silence ensued
the convention ary was the first to break it
her aise dhi msel fono neel bow to oka bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanical ly when one interrogate sand judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony

that is not all either why have you just question edme and talked to me about louis xvi i

the bishop hung his head and replied vermis sum iam a worm
a worm of the earth in a carriage
growled the convention ary
it was the convention ary 's turn to be arrogant and the bishop 's to be humble

let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me
where were we
what were you saying to me
that ' was inexorable

what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine
what think you of boss uet chanting the ted eu move rthe dragon nade s
the retort was a harsh on ebu tit attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel
the bishop quivered under it noreply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of all udi ngt obo ssue t
the best of mind swill have the irf etic he sand they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic
the convention ary began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breath sinter rupt ed his voice still there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes
he went on let me say afew words more in this and that direction iam willing

from its most terrible blow sthe recom esf or tha care ssf or the human race

and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the convention ary concluded his thoughts in the set ran qui lwo rds yes the brutalities of progress are called revolution s
when the yare over this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed
the convention ary doubted not that he had success ive lyco nq uer eda llt he inmost in trench ments of the bishop
one remained however and from this in trench men tthe last resource of monseigneur bienvenu 's resistance came forth this reply where in appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning progress should be lieve in god
good can not have an impious servi to r
he who is an atheist is but abad leader for the human race
the former representative of the people made noreply
he was seized with a fit of trembling
he looked towards heaven and in his glance at ear gathered slowly
when the eyelid was full the tear trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plunged in the depths otho u
oid eal
thou alone exist est
the bishop experience dani ndes crib able shock
after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said the infinite is
heist here
if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist
the reis the nani
that i ofthe infinite is god
the dying man had pronounced the sela st words in aloud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld someone
when he had spoken his eyes closed
the effort had exhausted him
it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him
that which he had said brought him near ert ohim who is in death
the supreme moment was approaching
the bishop understood this time pressed it was a sap ries tth at heh adcom efr ome xtreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those close de yes he took that wrinkled aged and ice cold hand in his and bent over the dying man
this hour is the hour of god
do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain
the convention ary opened his eyes again
agra vity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance
bishop said he with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength ihave passed my life in meditation study and contemplation

what is it that you have come to ask of me
your blessings aid the bishop
and he knelt down
when the bishop raised his head again the face of the convention ary had become a ugust
he had just expired
the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thought sw hich can not be known to us
he passed the whole night in prayer
onthe following morning some bold and curious person sat tempted to speak to him about member of the convention ghe content ed himself with pointing heavenward
from that moment here double dhis tenderness and brother lyfe eling towards all children and sufferers
any allusion to that old wretch of a gca used him to fall into a singular preoccupation
noone could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his didnot count for something in his approach to perfection
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coterie s
was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop

oh

that 's a coarse color replied the bishop
it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat
chapter xi are strict ion we should incur a great risk of deceiving ourselves were wet oco ncl ude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop or apa trio tic cure
his meeting which may almost be designated as his union with convention ary gle ft behind it in his mind as orto fast on is hme nt which rendered him still more gentle
that is all
although monseigneur bienvenu was far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the event soft hate poch supposing that monseigneur bienvenue ver dreamed of having a nat tit ude

the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty
this is no doubt what the bishop of dth ought
it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the idea soft he century once rtai nde lic at epo in ts
he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly press edit seems that he would have been found to be an ultra montaner at her than a gallica n
since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline
beginning with he gave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations
here fused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayer sfor the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days
besides his sister mademoiselle baptist in eheh adt wob rother son eag eneral the other apr efect
he wrote to both with tolerable frequency
he was harsh for a time to ward sthe former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person who mon eis desirous of allowing to escape
his correspondence with the other brother the expref ect afin ewo rth yma nw holi vedi nre tire mentat paris rue cassette remained more affectionate
thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud
the shadow of the passion soft he moment traverse dth is grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions

in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation
and it was a crime to applaud in inthe presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head
in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver at the irs in ister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of the bishop of dough tno tpe rha pst oh ave failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of agreat nation and agreat man on the brink of the abyss
with this exception he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence
he was a priest as a gea nda man
it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more soper haps than we who are speaking here
the porter of the townhall had been placed the re by the emperor
he was an old noncommissioned officer of the old guard am ember of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bona part is tas the eagle
this poor fellow occasionally lets lip inconsiderate remarks which the law the nsti gmat ized assed it ious speeches
after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his regiment alsa she said so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross
he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and he would not put anything in its place
iwill die he said rather than we art het hree frogs upon my heart
he liked to scoff aloud at louis xviii
the gouty old creature in english gaiters
he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his
he was happy to combine in the same impr ecat ion the two things which he most detested prussia and england
he did it so often that he lost his place
the re he was turned out of the house with his wife and children and without bread
the bishops ent for him reproved him gently and appointed him beadle in the cathedral
in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy deeds and gentleman ners filled the town of dwi tha sort of tender and filial reverence

chapter xiii what he believed wear en oto blige dto sound the bishop of dont he score of orthodoxy
in the presence of such as oul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect
the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word
moreover certain nature sbe in ggi ven we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own
what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery
the ses ecre tso fthe inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where souls enter naked
the point on which we are certain is that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case
node ca yi spo ssi ble to the diamond
he believed to the extent of his powers
credo in pat re mhe often exclaimed
moreover he drew from good work sth at amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to amant hou art with god
the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of an dbe yond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love
it was in that quarter quia multum am a vit because he loved much that he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locution so four sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry
what was this excess of love
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended event othing s

sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and the nth ere was nothing more venerable possible
monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been ifthe stories an ent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed apas sion at eand possibly a violent man
his universal sua vity was less an instinct of nature than the result of agra ndc on vic tion which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled the res low lyth ought by though tfor in a character as in a rock there may exist aperture smad eby drops of water

in a swet hink wehave already said he reached his seventy fifth birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty
he was not tall he was rather plump and inorder to combat this tendency he was fond of taking long stroll son foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent ade tail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion

monseigneur welcome had what the people term afin ehe adb uts oam iab lewa she that the yfor got that it was fine
when he converse dwi tht hatin fan tile gay et yw hich was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at the ire as ewi th him and joys eem edt or a diate from his whole person
his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man he'sa good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man
that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon
onthe first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but afin eman
but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured a ndt ook on some imposing quality iknow not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding as mili ngang els low ly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile
respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him on eof those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought i sso grand that it can nolonger bean yth in gb ut gentle
as we have seen prayer the celebration of the office so fre ligi on almsgiving the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of abit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled everyday of his life
filled is exactly the word certainly the bishop 's day was quite full tothe brim of good words and good deeds
nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to be dan daft erth et wow omen had retired
it seemed to be as orto fri tew it hhi mto prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heaven s
sometimes i fthe two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walk sata very advanced hour of the night
he was the real one communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellation sand the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown
at such moments while he offered his heart atthe hour when nocturnal flowers offer the irp erf ume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have to ldh ims elf probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take it sfl ight from him and something descend into him
mysterious exchange of the abyss esoft he soul with the abyss esoft he universe
he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity past am yst ery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced the ir way into all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible he gazed upon it
he did not study god he was dazzled by him

he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees
this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so encumbered with mean building sands he dsw as dear to him and satisfied his wants
what more was needed by this oldman who divided the leisure of his life where the rewa sso little leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night
was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to adore godin his most divine works in turn
does not this comprehend all infact
and what is the rele ft to desire beyond it
alittle garden inwhich to walk and immensity in which to dream
atone 's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked overhead that which one can study and meditate upon some flowers one art hand all the stars in the sky
chapter xiv what he thought one last word
since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop of dace rtai npa nthe is tical physiognomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained on eof those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and the retake on a form and grow until the yu sur pthe place of religion wein sist upon it that not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort
that which enlightened this man was his heart
his wisdom was made of the light which comes from the re
no systems many works
abstruse speculation sco nta invert igo not here is not hing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypse s
the apostle maybe daring but the bishop must be timid
he would probably have felt as cru pleats ound in gto of arin advance certain problems which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds

however that maybe there are one art hme nw hoare the ym en
perceived is tinct lya tthe verge of the horizon so fre very the height soft he absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain
monseigneur welcome was one of the semen monseigneur welcome was not age niu s
he would have feared those sublim it ies when ces ome very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity
certainly the sep ower ful reveries have the irmo ral utility and bythe sea rd uous paths one approach est oid eal perfection
as for him he took the path which shortens the gospel 's
he did not attempt to impart to his chas ubl ethe folds of elijah 's mantle he project edn or a yof future upon the dark groundswell of events he did not see kto condense inflame the light of things he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him
this humble soul love dan dth at was all
that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable but one can no more pray to om uch than one can love to om uch and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the text ssa in tthe res aand saint jerome would be here tics
he inclined to ward sall that groans and all that expiate s
the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound
the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in finding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve
that which exists was for this good and rare priest aper manent subject of sadness which sought consolation
the rear eme nw hot oil at extracting gold he toiled at the extraction of pity
universal misery was his mine
the sadness which reigned everywhere was butane xcu sef or unfailing kindness
love eachother he declared this to be completed esire dno thing further and that was the whole of his doctrine
one day that man who believe dhi msel ft obe a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop just survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit
your love eachother is nonsense
well replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself up in it as the pearl in the oyster
thus he shut himself up heli ved the re he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipice so fme tap hys icsa llt hose pro fund ities which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful so mna mb uli smo fthe animal the transformation in death there capitulation of existence sw hich the tomb contains the incomprehensible grafting of successive love son the persistent it hees sence the substance then i lean dthe enst he soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius man ousa in tpa uld antec on template with eyes flashing light ning which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze for tht here

it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handful so fg old to the citizens
the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel ofthe prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had beta ken himself to the three dauphin s

the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire

the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure

he did not turn round asin gle time
had he done so he would have seen the host of the cross of col bass tandi ngo nhis threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the passersby in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group hemi ght have divine dth at his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
he saw nothing of all this

thus he proceeded for sometime walking on without ceasing traversing a tran do mstr eet so fw hich he knew nothing for get ful of his fatigue as is often the case when amani ssa d
all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply
night was drawing near
he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter

the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the low studded room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and byala rge fire on the heart h
some men were engaged in drinking there
the landlord was warming himself
an iron pot suspended from a crane bubble dover the flame
the entrance to this public house which is also as orto fan in nis by two doors
one opens on the street the other upon as mall yard filled with manure
the traveller dare not enter bythe street door
he slipped into the yard halted again the nra is edt he latch timidly and opened the door
who goes there
said the master
someone who wants supper and bed
good

he entered
all the men who were drinking turned round
the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other
the ye xa mine dhi mfor sometime while he was taking off his knapsack
the host said to him there is the fire
the supper is cooking in the pot
come and warm yourself comrade
he approached and seated himself near the heart h
he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire afin eod or was emitted by the pot
all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering best ows
it was more over a firm energetic and melancholy profile
this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeming humble and ended by seeming severe
the eyes hone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood
one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chaff auth adbe ent osta bleh is horse at lab arre 's

this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously ofthe group which surrounded jacqui nla barre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of col bas
from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign tothe tavern keeper
the tavern keeper went to him

the man had again become absorbed in his reflections
the tavern keeper returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him you are going to get out of her e
the stranger turned round and replied gently a h

the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of col basa nd whose emed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him

at this table sata man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was dan dling alittle child on his knees
close by avery young woman was nursing another child
the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling
the stranger paused a moment in rever ybe for eth is tender and calming spectacle
what was taking place within him
he alone could have to ld
it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps alittle pity
he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock
the ydi dno the arh im
he tapped again
hehe ard the woman say it seems to me husband that someone is knocking
no replied the husband
he tapped at hird time
the husband rose to okt he lamp and went to the door which he opened
he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan
he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which aham me rare dhan dke rch ie fap owd erh or nanda lls or ts of objects which were upheld by the girdle asin apoc ket caused to bulge out
he carried his head thrown back wards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his bull neck white and bare
he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a snout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable
pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and acorn ero ft hats he dyo nder in the garden inwhich to sleep
tell me can you
for money
who are you
demanded the master of the house
the man replied ihave just come from puy mois son
ihave walked all day long
ihave travel led twelve league s

iwould not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me
but why do you not got othe in n

this is neither a fair nora market day
have you been to lab arre
yes
well
the traveller replied with embarrassment id on otk now
he did not receive me
have you been to what 's his name 's in the rue chaff aut
the stranger 's embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either
the peasant 's countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder are you the man
he cast afresh glance upon the stranger to okt hree steps backwards place dthe lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall
meanwhile at the words are you the man
the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitate ly behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low to nets omar aud e
all this took place in less time than it requires topic ture it to one 's self
after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinize savi perth emas tero fthe house returned to the door and said clear out
for pity 's sake a glass of water said the man
as hot from my gun
said the peasant
the nhe closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts
amo men tla tert he windows hutter was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
night continued to fall
aco ldw in dfr omt heal psw as blowing
by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the garden sw hich bordered the street as orto fhu twh ich seemed to him to be built of sods
he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden
he approached the hut its door consisted of avery low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which road laborers construct for the mse lve salon gthe roads
he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a road laborer he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was atleast a shelter from the cold
this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night
he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut
it was warmth ere and he found at ole rab lygo odb edo fst raw
he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed with out the power to make a movement sofa tig ued was he
the nast he knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover api llow ready to his hand he set about unb uck lingo neo fthe straps
at that moment afer ocio us grow lbe came audible
her aise dhis eyes
the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut
it was a dog 's kennel
he was himself vigorous and formidable hear me dhi msel fwi th his staff made as hi eldo fhi skn apsa cka ndma de his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his rags
he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged inorder to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing design at eas larose co uve rte
when he had not without difficulty repassed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge with out shelter without a roof over his head chase dev en from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on aston eand it appears that apas serb yhe ard him exclaim iam not even a dog
he soon rose again and resume dhis march
he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the field sw hich would afford him shelter
he walked thus for sometime with his head still drooping
when he felt himself far from every human habitation her aise dhis eyes and gazed search in gly about him
he was in afield
before him was one of those low hills covered with close cuts tub blew hich after the harvest resembles have dhea ds
the horizon was perfectly black
this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky
meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as the rewa sst ill floating in the zenith are mna nto fthe brightness of twilight the sec loud sfor med att he summit of the sky as orto fw hit is harc hwh ence a gleam of light fell upon the earth
the earth was thus better light edt han the sky which produces a particular lys in ister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and mean was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow
the rewa snot hing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered afew pace sdi stan tfr omt he wayfarer
this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and rever yhe turned back abruptly
the rear eins tants when nature seems hostile
here traced his steps the gates of dwe re closed
dwh ich had sustained siege sdu ring the war so fre ligi on was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square tower sw hich have been demolished since
he passed through a breach and entered the town again
it might have been eight o'clock in the evening
as he was not acquainted with the streets here commenced his walk at random
in this way he came to the prefecture the ntot he seminar y
as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church
atthe corner of this square there is a printing establishment
it is the retha tthe proclamation soft he emperor and ofthe imperial guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time

at that moment an old woman came out of the church
she saw the man stretched out in the shadow
what are you doing the remy friend
said she
he answered harshly and angrily as you see my good woman iams lee ping
the good woman who was well worth ythe name in fact was the marquis eder on this bench
she went on

the good woman touched the man 's armand pointed out to him on the other side of the street as mall low house which stood beside the bishop 's palace

chapter ii prudence counsel led to wisdom
that evening the bishop of daft erh is promenade through the town remained shutup rather late in his room
he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately
he was carefully compiling everything that the father sand the doctor shave said on this important subject
his book was divided into two parts first lyth edu ties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the class to which he belongs
the duties of all are the great duties

duties towards one 's self matt

as for the other duties the bishop found the mpo in ted out and prescribed elsewhere to sovereign sands ub jects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to you ngm enb ysa in tpe tert oh us bands father schild renan dse rva nts in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrew sto virgin sin the epistle to the corinthians
out of the sep recept she was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls
at eight o'clock he was still at work writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper with a big book open on his knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the silverware from the cupboard near his bed
amo men tla tert he bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him shut his book rose from his table and entered the dining room
the dining room was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on the garden
madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the table
as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle baptist in e
alam pst ood on the table the table was near the fireplace
a wood fire was burning the re
one can easily picture to one 's self these two women both of whom were over sixty years of age
madame magloire small plump vivacious mademoiselle baptist in egen tle slender frail somewhat taller than her brother dressed in a gown of puce colored silk ofthe fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted ever since
to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in asin glew or dto an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptist in eth at ofa lady
madame magloire wore a white quilted cap ago ld jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that the rewa sin the house avery white fic hup uffi ngo utf roma gown of coarse black wool lens tuff with large shortsleeve san apron of cotton cloth in red and green check skn otte dro und the waist with agree nri bbo nwi tha stomach ero fthe same attached by two pins at the upper corner sco arses hoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles
mademoiselle baptist in e 's gown was cut on the pattern so fwi tha short waist an arrow sheath like skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons
she concealed her gray hair under a frizz ed wig known as the baby wig
madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her ara the rcra bbe dandi mpe rious look
solon gas monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like her mistress
mademoiselle baptist in edi dno tev en speak
she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him
she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and along arched nose but he rwho levis age her whole person breathed for than ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning
she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues which mildly warmth eso ul had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
nature had made her alam brel igi on had made her an angel
poor saint ed virgin
sweet memory which has vanished
mademoiselle baptist in eha sso often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that the rear eman ype opl en owl iv in gwh osti llr ecal lthe most minute details
atthe moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity
she was haranguing mademoiselle baptist in eon as ub ject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed
the question concerned the lockup on the entrance door
it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places
people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance as us pic ious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into the ir heads to return home late that night might be subject edt oun pleasant encounters
the police was very badly organized moreover because the rewa sno love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure eachother by making things happen
it behoove dwi sep eople to play the part of the irow npo lice and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to duly close baran dba rri cadet heir house sand to fasten the doors well
madame magloire emphasized the sela st words but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold
he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and the nfe llt oth in king of other things
he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire
she repeated it
the nma demoiselle baptist in edes iro us of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother venture dto say timidly did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother
ihave heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop
the nha lft urn in gin his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come what is the matter
what is the matter
are we in any great danger
the nma dame magloire began the whole story afresh exaggerating it alittle without being aware of the fact
it appeared that a bohemian abare footed vagabond as orto fda nger ous mendicant was a tth at moment in the town
he had presented himself at jacqui nla barre 's too bta in lodgings but the latter had not been willing to take him in
he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gas send ian dro am about the streets in the glo amin g
aga llow sbir dwi that err ible face
really
said the bishop
this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire its eem edt oh ert oin dicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming a la rmed she pursued triumphantly yes monseigneur
that is how it is
the re will be some sort of catastrophe in this town tonight
everyone says so
and with a lthe police is so badly regulated aus ef ulr epe tition
the idea of living in amount aino us country and not even having lights in the streets at night
one goes out
black as ovens indeed
and is a ym on seigneur and mademoiselle the resa ys with me ii nter rupt ed his sister say nothing
what my brother does is well done
madame magloire continued as though the reha dbe enno protest we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will permit iwill go and tell paul in muse bois the locksmith to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors wehave the man dit is only the work of a moment for isa yth at nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first pass erb yand is a yth at wen eed bolts monseigneur if only for this night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying ' come in ' and besides even in the middle of the night omo ndi eu
the reis none edt oas kpe rmi ssion
at that moment there came at ole rab ly violent knock on the door
come in said the bishop
chapter iii the heroism of passive obedience
the door opened
it opened wide with a rapid movement as though someone had given it an energetic and resolute push
aman entered
we already know the man
it was the wayfarer who mwe have seen wandering about in search of shelter
he entered advanced as tep and halted leaving the door open behind him
he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hand arou gha uda cious wear yand violent expression in his eyes
the fire on the heart hli ght ed him up
he was hideous
it was a sinister apparition
madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry
she trembl edan dsto odw it hhe rmo uth wide open
mademoiselle baptist in etu rne dro und beheld the man entering and half started up in terror the ntu rning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calman dse rene
the bishop fixed at ran qui le yeon the man
as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired the man rested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said in aloud voices ee here

madame magloire retired to execute the seo rder s
the bishop turned to the man
sit down sir and warm yourself
we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are supp in g
at this point the man suddenly comprehended
the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stu pef action of doubt of joy and became extraordinary
he began stammering like a crazy man really

he said mass in the middle of the galleys on an altar
he had a point edt hing made of gold on his head it glittered in the bright light of midday
we were all ranged in line son the three sides with cannons with light edma tches facing us
we could not see very well
he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear
that is what a bishop is like
while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wide open
madame magloire returned
she brought as i lve rfor kand spoon which she placed on the table
madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire as possible
and turning to his guest then i ght wind is harsh on the alps
you must be cold sir
each time that he uttered the words irin his voice which was so gently grave and polished the man 's face light edu p
monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa
ignominy thirst sfor consideration
this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop
madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimney piece in monseigneur 's bedchamber and placed the mli ght edon the table
monsieur le cures aid the many oua reg ood you do not despise me
your ece ive mein to your house
you light your candles for me

the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand
you could not help telling me who you were
this is not myhouse it is the house of jesus christ
this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has an ameb ut whether he has a grief

if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of goodwill and of peace you are more worthy than anyone of us
in the meantime madame magloire had served supper soup made with water oil bread and salt alittle bacon abit of mutton figs afresh cheese and alar gel oaf of rye bread
she had of her own accord added to the bishop 's ordinary fare abot tle of his old mauve swine
the bishop 's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable nature s
to table
he cried vivaciously
as was his custom when astra nger supped with him he made the man sito nhis right
mademoiselle baptist in eper fect ly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left
the bishop asked able ssi ngt he nh el ped the soup himself according to his custom
the man began to eat with a vidi ty
all at once the bishops aid its trikes meth ere is something missing on this table
madame magloire had infact only place dthe three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary
now it was the usage of the house when the bishop had anyone to supper to layout the whole six sets of silver onthe tablecloth an innocent ostentation
this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child 's play which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty in to dignity
madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word and am omen tla tert he three sets of silver for ksa nds poons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table
chapter iv details concerning the cheese dairies of ponta rli er
now in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table we can not do better than to transcribe here apas sage from one of mademoiselle baptist in e 's letters to madame bois chevron where in the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described within genious minute ness
this man paid no attention to anyone

one thing struck me
this man was what i have to ldy ou
well neither during supper nord uring the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which could remind them an of what he was no rof what my brother was
to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him alittle sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convicts otha tamar kof the passage might remain behind
this might have appeared to anyone else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul aswell as his body and to be stow upon him some reproach season ed with moralizing and advice or alittle commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future
my brother did not even as khim from what country he came nor what was his history
for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it
to such a point did he carry it that atone time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of ponta rli erw hoe xer cise agent lela born ear heaven and who head de dare happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man
by dint of reflection it hink ihave comprehended what was passing in my brother 's heart
he was thinking no doubt that this man who sena meisje an valjean had his misfortune only to ovi vid ly present in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believe if only momentarily that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way
isnot this indeed to understand charity well

it has seemed to me that this might have been my brother 's private thought
in any case what i can say is that if he entertained all the seide as he gave no sign of the mfr omb eg inning to end event ome he was the same as he is every evening and he supped with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m

the man was not paying much he edt oan yth in gthe n
he was nolonger talking and he seemed very much fatigue d
after poor old ger baud had taken her departure my brother said grace the nhe turned to the man and said to him ' you must be in great need of your bed

the man followed him
as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was so arranged that inorder to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated or to get out of it itwas necessary to traverse the bishop 's bedroom
atthe moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed

chapter vi jean valjean towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke
jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie
he had not learned to read in his childhood
when he reached man 's estate he became a tree pruner at favero lles
his mother was named jeanne mathieu his father was called jean valjean or vla jean probably as obr ique tanda contract ion of viola jean here 's jean
jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate nature s
onthe whole however there was something decided lys lugg is hand insignificant about jean valjean in appearance at least
he had lost his father and mother at avery early age
his mother had died of a milk fever which had not been properly attended to
his father at reep run erl ike himself had been killed by a fall from a tree
all that remained to jean valjean was a sister older than himself a widow with seven children boys and girls
this sister had brought up jean valjean and solo nga ssh ehad a husband she lodge dan dfe dhe ryou ngb rother
the husband died
the eldest of the seven children was eight years old
the youngest one
jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year
he took the father 's place and in his turn support edt he sister who had brought him up
this was done simply as a duty and even alittle churlish lyon the part of jean valjean
thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill paid to il
he had never know naki nd woman friend in his native parts
he had not had the time to fall in love
here turned at night wear yand at ehi sbr oth without uttering a word
his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating abit of meat as liceo fba cont hehe art of the cabbage to give to one of her children
as he went on eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soup his long hair falling about his bowland concealing his eyes he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it

that is all
onlyonce during all the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mentioned
this happened ithink towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity
iknow not through what channels then ews reached him
someone who had known the mint heir own country had seen his sister
she was in paris
she lived in a poor street rear saints ulp ice in the rue du gin dre
she had with her only one child alittle boy they oung est
where were the other six
perhaps she did not know herself
every morning she went to a printing office no
rue du sabot where she was a folder and stitch er
she was obliged to be the reat six o'clock in the morning long before daylight in winter
in the same building with the printing office there was a school and to this school she took her little boy who was seven years old
but as she entered the printing office at six and the school only opened at seventh ech il dha dto waitin the courtyard fort hesch ool to open for an hour one hour of a winter night in the open air
the yw ould not allow the child to come into the printing office because he was in the way they said

towards the end of this fourth year jean valjean 's turn to escape arrived
his comrades assisted him as is the custom in that sad place
he escaped
he wandered for two days in the field sat liberty if being a tlib erty is to be hunted to turn the head every instant to quake at the slightest noise to be afraid of everything of a smoking roof of a passing man of a barking dog of a galloping horse of a striking clock of the day because one can see ofthe night because one can not see ofthe highway ofthe path of a bush of sleep
onthe evening of the second day he was captured
he had neither eaten nor slept for thirty six hours
the maritime tribunal condemned him for this crime to aprol on gation of his term for three years which made eight years
in the sixth year hist urn to escape occurred again he availed himself of it but could not accomplish his flight fully
he was missing at rollcall
the cannon were fired and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction here sisted the galley guards who seized him

nineteen years
in october he was released he had entered the rein for having broken apan eof glass and take nalo a fof bread
room for a brief parenthesis
this is the second time during his studies on the penal question and damnation bylaw that the author of this book has come across the theft of a loaf of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny
claude gue ux had stolen al oaf jean valjean had stolen al oaf
english statistics prove the fact that fourth efts out of five in london have hunger for the iri mme diate cause
jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering he emerged impassive
he had entered in despair he emerged gloomy
what had taken place in that soul
chapter vii the interior of despair let us try to say it
it is necessary that society should look at the set hing sbec aus eit is itself which creates the m
he was a swe have said an ignorant man but he was not a fool
the light of nature was ignited in him
unhappiness which also possesses a clear ness of vision of its own augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this mind
beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in the cell in hardship beneath the burning sun ofthe galleys upon the plan kb edo fthe convict hewit hdr ewin to his own consciousness and meditated
he constitute dhi msel fthe tribunal
he began by putting himself on trial
here cogni zed the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished
head mitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it that in any case it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work that it is not an unanswerable argument to say canon ewa it when one is hungry
that in the first place it is very rare for anyone to die of hunger literally and next that fortunately or unfortunately man is so constituted that he can suffer long and much both morally and physical ly with out dying that it is therefore necessary to have patience that that would even have been better for those poor little children that it had been an act of madness for him a miserable unfortunate wretch to take society atlarge violently by the collar and to imagine that one can escape from misery through the ftth at that is in any case apo or door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enter sins hort that he was in the wrong
the nhe asked himself whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history
whether it was not as eri oust hing that he ala borer out of work that he ani ndus trio usman should have lacked bread
and whether the fault once committed and confessed the chastisement had not been ferocious and disproportion ed
whether the reha dno tbe enmore abuse on the part of the law in respect to the penalty than the reha dbe enon the part of the culprit in respect to his fault
whether the reha dno tbe enan excess of weight sinon eba lance of the scale in the one which contains expiation
whether the overweight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crimean ddi dno tres ulti nre versi ngt he situation of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression of converting the guilty man in to the victim and the debtor in to the creditor and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it
whether this penalty complicated by successive aggravation sfor attempts at escape had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feeble rac rime of society against the individual acri me which was being committed afresh everyday acri me which had lasted nineteen years
he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight and in the other case for its pitiless foresight and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess ade fault of work and an excess of punishment
whether it was not outrageous for society to treat thus precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance and consequently the most deserving of consideration
the seq uestions put and answered he judged society and condemned it
he condemned it to his hatred
he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account
he declared to himself that the rewa sno equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not in truth unjust but that it most assuredly was iniquitous
anger maybe both foolish and absurd one can be irritated wrongfully one is exasperated only when the reiss ome show of right on one 's side at bottom
jean valjean felt himself exasperated
and besides human society had done him nothing but harm he had never seen anything of its ave that angry face which it calls justice and which it shows to those who mit strikes
men had only touched him to bruise him
every contact with the mha dbe en abl ow
never since his infancy since the day so fhi smother of his sister had he ever encountered a friend ly word and akin dly glance
from suffering to suffering he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war and that in this war he was the conquered
he had no other weapon than his hat e
here solved to whet it in the galleys and to be a rita way with him when he departed
the rewa sat toulon as chool for the convicts kept by the ignorant in friars where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for the m
he was ofthe number who had a mind
he went to school at the age of forty and learned to read to write to cipher
he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hat e
in certain cases education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil
this is a sad thing to say after having judge dso ciety which had caused his unhappiness he judged providence which had made society and he condemned it also
thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery this soul mounted and atthe sametime fell
light entered it on one side and darkness on the other
jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil nature
he was still good when he arrived at the galleys
hether econ dem ned society and felt that he was becoming wicked hether econ dem ned providence and was conscious that he was becoming impious
it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point
does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom
can the man created good by god berend ered wicked by man
can the soul be completely made over by fate and become evil fate being evil
can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable deformities and infirmities under the oppression of a disproportionate unhappiness as the vertebral column beneath to olo wav ault
isthe reno tine very human soul was the reno tint he soul of jean valjean in particular afir sts park adi vine element incorruptible in this world immortal in the other which good can develop fan ignite and make to glow with splendor and which evil can never wholly extinguish
grave and obscure questions to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no and that without hesitation had he beheld a tto ulo nd uring the hours of repose which were for jean valjean hours of rever yth is gloomy galleys lave seated with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket top rev ent its dragging serious silent and thoughtful apar iah of the laws which regarded the man with wrath condemned by civilization and regarding heaven with severity
certainly an dwe make no attempt to diss im ulate the fact the observing physiologist would have beheld a nir remedia blem is ery he would perchance have pitied this sick man of the law 's making but he would not have even essay edan yt reatment he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soul and liked an tea tthe portal so fhe ll he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of god has nevertheless inscribed upon the brow of every man hope
was this state of his soul which we have attempted to analyze as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us
did jean valjean distinctly perceive after the irf ormation and had he seen distinctly during the process of the irf ormation all the elements of which his moral misery was composed
had this rough and unlettered manga the red aper fect lyc lear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had by degrees mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had for soma ny years for me dthe inner horizon of his spirit
was he conscious of all that passed within him and of all that was working there
that is something which we do not presume to state itis something which we do not even believe
the rewa sto om uchi gno rance in jean valjean even after his misfortune to prevent much vagueness from still lingering the re
at times he did not right lyk now himself what he felt
jean valjean was in the shadows he suffered in the shadows he hated in the shadows on emi ght have said that he hated in advance of himself
he dwelt habitually in this shadow feeling his way like a blind man and a dream er
only at intervals there suddenly came to him from without an dfr om within an access of wrath as urc har geo fsu ffe ring ali vida ndr api dfl as hwh ichi llu min at edh is whole soul and caused to appear abruptly all around him in front behind a mid the gleam sofa frightful light the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny
the flash passed the night closed in again and where was he
he nolonger knew
the peculiarity of pain soft his nature in which that which is pitiless that is to say that which is brutalizing predominates is to transform a man little by little by a sort of stupid transfiguration into a wild beasts ome times in to a ferocious beast
jean valjean 's success ive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working ofthe law upon the human soul
jean valjean would have renewed the seat tempts utterly useless and foolish as the yw ere as often as the opportunity had presented itself without reflecting for an instant on the result nor on the experience sw hich he had already gone through
he escaped impetuously like the wolf who finds his cage open
instincts aid to him flee
reason would have said remain
but in the presence of so violent at empt ation reason vanished nothing remained but instinct
the beast alone acted
when he was recaptured the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild
one detail which we must not omit is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by asin gle one of the denizens of the galleys
at work at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan jean valjean was worth four men
he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weight son his back and when the occasion demanded it here placed that implement which is called a jacks crew and was formerly called or gue il pride when ce we may remark in passing is derived the name of the rue mon to rgu eil near the hall esf is hma rke tin paris
his comrades had nickname dhi mje an the jack screw
once when the yw ere repairing the balcony of the townhall at toulon one of those admirable car yat ids of puget which support the balcony became loosened and was on the point of falling
jean valjean who was present support edt he car yat id with his shoulder and gave the work men time to arrive
his suppleness even exceeded his strength
certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined
it is the science of muscles
an entire system of mysterious static sis daily practised by prisoners men who are forever envious of the flies and birds
to climb avert ical surface and to find points of support where hardly a project ion was visible was play to jean valjean
an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone her aise dhi msel fas if by magic to the third story
he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison
he spoke but little
he laughed not at all
an excessive emotion was required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh of the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon
to all appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible
he was absorbed in fact
athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushed intelligence he was confused lyco nsci oust hats ome monstrous thing was resting on him
in that obscure and wans had oww it hin which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essay edt or a is ehi sgl an ceh eper ceived with terror mingled with rage as orto ffr ight fula ccum ulation of things collecting and mounting above him beyond the range of his vision laws prejudice sme nand deeds whose outlines escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization
he distinguished here and the rein that swarming and for mles smas snow near him now afar off and on inaccessible tablelands some groups ome detail vividly illuminated here the galleys erg ean tan dhis cudgel the re the gendarme and his sword yonder the mitre darc hbi shop away at the top like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling
it seemed to him that the sedis tants plen do rsf arf rom dissipating his night rendered it more funereal and more black
all this laws prejudice sde eds men things went and came above him over his head in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civilization walking over him and crushing him with iknow not what peacefulness in its cruelty and in exo rabi lity in its indifference
soul sw hich have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy menlo stint he lowestoft hose limbo sat which noone any longer looks there proved ofthe law feel the whole weight of this humans ociety so formidable for him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon the ir heads
in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature of his meditation
if the grain of millet beneath the millstone had thought sit would doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought
all the set hing sre ali ties full of spectre sph an tas magor ies full of realities had eventually create dfor him as orto fin terior state which is almost indescribable
at times amid his convict to ilh epa used
he fell to thinking
his reason at one and the same time ripe rand more trouble dth an of yore rose in revolt
everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible
he said to himself itis adr eam
he gazed at the galleys erg ean tst and in gaf ewp aces from him the galleys erg ean tse emed apha nto mto him
all of a sudden the phantom dealt him a blow with his cudgel
visible nature hardly existed for him
it would almost be true to say that the re existed for jean valjean neither sun nor fine summer days nor radiant sky nor fresh april dawn s
iknow not what vent hole daylight habitually illumined his soul
to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen years jean valjean the inoffensive tree pruner of favero lles the formidable convict of toulon had become capable than kst othe manner in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action firstly of evil action which was rapid un premeditated dashing entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone second lyo fev ilac tion which was serious grave consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish
his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases which nature sofa certain stamp can alone traverse reasoning will perseverance
he had for moving causes his habitual wrath bitterness of soul apr of ound sense of indignities suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the just ifthe rear ean ysu ch
the point of departure like the point of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred which i fit be not arrested in its development by some providential incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society the nth eha tred of the human race the nth eha tred of creation and which manifests itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to some living being no matter who m
it will be perceived that it was not without reason that jean valjean 's passport described him as a very dangerous man
from year to year this soul had dried away slowly but with fatal sureness

chapter ix new trouble sw he nthe hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys when jean valjean heard in his earth estrange words thou art free
the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented ara yof vivid light ara yof the true light of the living suddenly penetrated with in him
but it was not long before this ray pale d
jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty
he had believed in an ew life
he very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which aye llow passport is provided
and this was encompassed with much bitterness
he had calculated that his earnings during his sojourn in the galleys ought to amount to a hundred and seventy one francs
it is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the force dre pose of sunday sand festival days during nineteen years which entailed a diminution of about eight yf ran cs
at all events his hoard had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which had been counted out to him on his departure
he had understood nothing of this and had thought himself wrong ed
let us say the word robbed
onthe day following his liberation he saw a tgr as sein front of an orange flower distillery some men engaged in unloading bales
he offered his services
business was pressing the yw ere accepted
he set to work
he was intelligent robust adroit he did his best them as terse emed please d
while he was a two rka gendarme passed observed him and demanded his papers
it was necessary to show him the yellow passport
that done jean valjean resume dhis labor
alittle while before he had questioned on eof the work men as to the amount which the year ned each day at this occupation he had been told thirty sous
when evening arrived as he was forced to set out again on the following day he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid
the owner did not utter a word but handed him fifteen sous
he objected
he was told that is enough for the e
he persisted
the master looked him straight between the eyes and said to him beware of the prison
the rea gain he considered that he had been robbed
society the state by diminishing his hoard had robbed him wholesale
now it was the individual who was robbing him at retail
liberation is not deliver an ce
one gets free from the galleys but not from the sentence
that is what happened to him at grass e
wehave seen in what manner he was received at dcha pter xthe man aroused as the cathedral clocks truck two in the morning jean valjean awoke
what woke him was that his bed was too good
it was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed and although he had not undressed the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumber s
he had slept more than four hours
his fatigue had passed away
he was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose
he opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him the nhe closed the mag ain with the intention of going to sleep on cem or e
when many varied sensations have agitated the day when various matters preoccupy the mind one falls asleep on cebu tno tas econ dti me
sleep comes more easily than it returns
this is what happened to jean valjean
he could not get to sleep again and he fell to thinking
he was a tone of those moments when the thoughts which one has inone 's mind are troubled
the rewa sas or to fda rkc on fusion in his brain
his memories of the old ent imea nd ofthe immediate present floated the repel lme llan dmin gle dc on fused ly losing their proper form sbec omi ng disproportionately large the nsu dde nly disappearing as in a muddy and perturbed pool
many thoughts occurred to him but there was one which kept constant ly presenting itself afresh and which drove away all other s
wewill mention this thought at once he had observed the six sets of silver for ksa nds poons and the ladle which madame magloire had placed on the table
those six sets of silver haunted him
the yw ere the re
afew pace sdi stan t
just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was the old servant woman had been in the act of placing the minal it tle cupboard near the head of the bed
he had taken care ful not eof this cupboard
onthe right as you entered from the dining room
the yw eres oli d
and old silver
from the ladle one could get atleast two hundred francs
double what he had earned in nineteen years
it is true that he would have earned more ifthe administration had not robbed him
his mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which the rewa scer tainly mingled some struggle
three o'clock struck
he opened his eyes again drew himself up abruptly in to as it ting postures tre tche do uth is a rman dfe lto fhi skn apsa ck which he had thrown down on acorn ero fthe alcove the nhe hung his legs over the edge of the bed and placed his feet on the floor and thus found himself almost without knowing it seated on his bed
here maine dfor at imet hough tfu lly in this attitude which would have been suggestive of something sinister for anyone who had seen him thus in the dark the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping
all of a sudden he stooped down removed his shoes and placed the msoft lyon the mat beside the bed then here sumed his thoughtful attitude and became motionless on cem or e
throughout this hideous meditation the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain entered with drew reentered and in a manner oppressed him and the nhe thought also without knowing why and with the mechanical persistence of rever yof acon vic tname dbr eve twh omh ehad known in the galleys and whose trousers had been upheld by asin gles us pender of knitted cotton
the checkered pattern of that suspender recurred in cess an tly to his mind
here maine dint his situation and would have sore maine din definitely even until daybreak had not the clock struck one the half or quarter hour
it seemed to him that that strokes aid to him come on
her oset oh is feet hesitate dst ill another moment and listened all was quiet in the house the nhe walked straight ahead with short steps to the window of which he caught a glimpse
the night was not very dark there was a full moon across which course dla rge clouds driven by the wind
this created outdoors alternate shadow and gleams of light eclipse sthe nbr ight opening soft he clouds and indoor sas or to ftw il ight
this twilight sufficient to enable apers onto see his way intermittent on account of the clouds resembled the sort of livid light which falls through an air hole in a cellar before which the passersby come and go
on arriving at the window jean valjean examined it
it had no grating it opened in the garden and was fastened according to the fashion of the country only by a small pin
he opened it but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly he closed it again immediately
he scrutinized the garden with that attentive gaze which studies rather than looks
the garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall easy to climb
faraway at the extremity he perceived to pso ftree sspa ceda tre gular intervals which indicated that the walls epa rated the garden from an avenue orlane planted with trees
having taken this survey he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind strode to his alcove grasped his knapsack opened it fumbled in it pulled out of its ome thing which he placed on the bed put his shoes into one of his pocket ssh utt he whole thing up again threw the knapsack on his shoulders put on his cap drew the visordown over his eyes felt for his cudgel went and placed it in the angle of the window the nre turned to the bed and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there
it resembled a short bar of iron pointed like a pike at one end
it would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed
perhaps it was a lever possibly it was a club
in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner 's candlestick
convicts were at that period sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ to ulo nandi twas not rare for the mto have miners ' tools at the irc omm and
the semi ners ' candlesticks are of massive iron terminated at the lower extremity by a point by means of which the yare stuck in to the rock
he took the candlestick in his right hand holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room occupied by the bishop as we already know
on arriving at this door he found it ajar
the bishop had not closed it
chapter xi what he does jean valjean listened
not as ound
he gave the door apus h
he pushed it gently with the tip of his finger lightly with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering
the door yielded to this pressure and made an imperceptible and silent movement which enlarge dthe opening alittle
he waited a moment the nga vet he door as econ dan dabo lde rpu sh
it continued to yield in silence
the opening was now large enough to allow him to pass
but near the door there stood alittle table which formed an embarrassing angle with it and barred the entrance
jean valjean recognized the difficulty
it was necessary at any cost to enlarge the aperture still further
he decided on his course of action and gave the door at hird push more energetic than the two preceding
this time abad lyo ile d hinges ud den lye mitted amid the silence aho arse and prolonged cry
jean valjean shuddered
the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of judgment
in the fantastic exaggeration soft he first moment he almost imagine dth at that hinge had just become an imate dan dha dsu dde nly assumed at err ible life and that it was barking like a dog to arouse everyone and warn and to wake those who were asleep
he halted shuddering bewildered and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels
hehe ard the arteries in his temples beating like two for geha mme rsa ndi tse emed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern
it seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritate dhi nge should not have disturbed the entire household like the shock of an earthquake the door pushed by him had taken the alarm and had shouted the old man would rise at once the two old women would shriek out people would come to the iras sistance in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar and the gendarmerie on hand
for a moment he thought himself lost
here maine dwh ere he was petrified like the statue of salt not daring to make a movement
several minutes elapsed
the door had fallen wide open
he ventured to peep into the next room
nothing had stirred the re
helen tan ear
nothing was moving in the house
the noise made by the rusty hinge had not awakened anyone
this first danger was past but there still reigned afri ght ful tumult within him
nevertheless he did not retreat
even when he had thought himself lost he had not drawn back
his only thought now was to finish as soon as possible
he took a step and entered the room
this room was in a state of perfect calm
here and the rev a gue and confused for msw ered is ting uis hable which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table open folios volume spil edu pon as to olan armchair heaped with clothing apr ie die uand which at that hour were only shadow yc or ners and whitish spots
jean valjean advanced with precaution taking care not to knock against the furniture
he could hear a tthe extremity of the room the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping bishop
he suddenly came to a halt
he was near the bed
he had arrived there sooner than he had thought for
nature sometimes mingles here ffects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriate ness as though she desired to make us reflect
for the last half hour ala rge cloud had covered the heavens
atthe moment when jean valjean paused in front of the bed this cloud part edas though on purpose and a ray of light traversing the long windows ud den ly illuminated the bishop 's paleface
he was sleeping peacefully
he lay in his bed almost completely dressed on account of the cold ofthe basses alps in a garment of brown wool which covered his arms to the wrists
his head was thrown back on the pillow in the careless attitude of repose his hand adorned with the pastoral ring and when ceh adfa llen soma ny good deeds and so many holy actions was hanging over the edge of the bed
his whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction of hope and off elicit y
it was more than a smile and almost aradia nce
he bore upon his brow the indescribable reflection of alight which was invisible
the soul of the just contemplates in sleep am yst eri ous heaven
are flect ion of that heaven rested on the bishop
it was a tthe sametime alum in oust ran spare nc yfor that heaven was within him
that heaven was his conscience
illustration the fall bthe fall at the moment when the ray of moonlight superposed itself so to speak up on that inward radiance the sleeping bishops eem edas in a glory
it remained however gentle and veiled in an ineffable half light
that moon in the sky that slumbering nature that garden without a quiver that house which was so calm the hour the moment the silence added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man and envelope dinas or to fse rene and majestic aureole that white hair those close de yes that face in which all was hope and all was confidence that he ado fan oldman and that slumber of an infant
the rewa sso meth in gal most divine in this man who was thus august without being himself aware of it
jean valjean was in the shadow and stood motionless with his iron candle stick in his hand frightened by this luminous oldman
never had he beheld anything like this
this confidence terrified him
the moral world has no grande rsp ect acle than this at rouble dan dune as yc on science which has arrived on the brink of an evil action contemplating the slumber of the just
that slumber in that isolation and with an eigh bor like himself had about it something sublime of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious
noone could have to ldw hat was passing within him not even himself
inorder to attempt to form an idea of it itis necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle
even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty
it was a sort of haggard astonishment
he gazed at it and that was all
but what was his thought
it would have been impossible to divine it
what was evident was that he was touched and astounded
but what was the nature of this emotion
his eye never quit ted the old man
the only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision
one would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses the one in which one loses one 's self and that inwhich one saves one 's self
he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand
atthe expiration of a few minutes his left arm roses low lyt owa rds his brow and he took off his cap the nhis arm fell back with the same deliberation and jean valjean fell to meditating on cem or ehi scap in his left hand his club in his right hand his hair bristling all over his savage head
the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze
the gleam of the moon rendered confused ly visible the crucifix over the chimney piece which seemed to be extending its arms to both of the mwi tha benediction for one and pardon for the other
suddenly jean valjean replaced his cap on his brow the nstep pedra pid ly past the bed with out glancing at the bishops trai ght to the cupboard which he saw near the head her aise dhis iron candle stick as though to force the lock the key was the re he opened it the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware he seized it traverse dthe chamber with long strides with out taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise gained the door reentered the oratory opened the windows ei zed his cudgel best rode the windows ill of the ground floor put the silver into his knapsack threw away the basket crossed the garden leaped over the wall like a tiger and fled
chapter xii the bishop works the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden
madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation
monseigneur monseigneur
she exclaimed does your grace know where the basket of silver is
yes replied the bishop
jesus the lord be blessed
she resumed id id not know what had become of it
the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower bed
he presented it to madame magloire
here it is
well
said she
nothing in it
and the silver
ahr et urn edt he bishops oit is the silver which trouble syo u
id on ' tkn oww here it is

that man who was here lastnight has stolen it
in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman madame magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and return edt othe bishop
the bishop had just be ntd own and was sighing as he examined apla nto fco chl ear iad esg uil lons which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed
her ose up at madame magloire 's cry
monseigneur the man is gone
the silver has been stolen
as she uttered this exclamation here yes fell upon acorn ero fthe garden where traces of the wall having been scaled were visible
the coping of the wall had been torn away
stay
yonder is the way he went
he jumped over into coche file tla ne
ah the abomination
he has stolen our silver
the bishop remained silent for a moment the nhe raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire and in the first place was that silver our s
madame magloire was speechless
another silence ensued the nth ebi shop went on madame magloire ihave for along time detained that silver wrongfully
it belonged to the poor
who was that man
apo or man evidently
alas
jesus
return edma dame magloire
it is not for my sake nor for mademoiselle 's
it makes no difference to us
but it is for the sake of monseigneur
what is monseigneur to eat with no w
the bishop gazed at her with an air of amazement
ahc ome
are the reno such things as pewter for ksa nds poons
madame magloire shrugged her shoulders
pewter has an odor
iron for ksa nds poons the n
madame magloire made an expressive grimace
iron has a taste
very well said the bishop wooden ones the n
afew moments later he was breakfast in gatt hever yt able at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening
as he ate his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gay lyt oh is sister who said nothing and to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath that one really does not need either for kors poon even of wood inorder to dip abit of bread in a cup of milk
apr etty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and came to take in a man like that
and to lodge him close to one 's self
and how fortunate that he did not hing but steal
ahm on dieu
it makes one shudder to think of it
as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came a knock at the door
come in said the bishop
the door opened
asin gular and violent group made it sapp ear an ceo nthe threshold
three men were holding a fourth man by the collar
the three men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean
abri gadi ero fge nda rme sw hose emed to be in command of the group was standing near the door
he entered and advanced to the bishop making a military salute
monseigneur said he
at this word jean valjean who was dejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of stu pef action
monseigneur
he murmured
so he is not the cure
silence
said the gendarme
he is monseigneur the bishop
in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great age permitted
ah
here you are
he exclaimed looking at jean valjean
iam glad to see you
well but how is this
i gave you the candlesticks to ow hich are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs
why did you not carry the mawa yw it hyo ur for ksa nds poons
jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of
monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said is true then
we came across him
he was walking like a man who is running away
west opp ed him to look into the matter
he had this silver and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been given to him by akin do ldf ellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night
is ee how the matter stands
and you have brought him back here
it is a mistake
in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go
certainly replied the bishop
the gendarmes released jean valjean whore coiled
is it true that i am to be released
he said in an almost inarticulate voice and as though he were talking in his sleep
yes thou art released do stth oun otu nder stand
said one of the gendarmes
my friend resume dthe bishop before you go here are you rca nd lest i cks
take the m
he stepped to the chimney piece to okt he two silver candlesticks and brought the mto jean valjean
the two women looked on without uttering a word without a gesture with out a look which could disco ncert the bishop
jean valjean was trembling in every limb
he took the two candlesticks mechanical lya nd with a bewildered air
now said the bishop goin peace
by the way when you return my friend itis not necessary to passthrough the garden
you can always enter and depart through the street door
it is never fastened with anything but ala tche it herb yday or by night
the ntu rning to the gendarmes you may retire gentlemen
the gendarmes retired
jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting
the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice donot for get never forget that you have promised to use this money in becoming a nhon est man
jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless
the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered the m
here sumed with solemnity jean valjean my brother you nolonger belong to evil but to good
it is your soul that i buy from you iwi thd raw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and igiv eit to go d
chapter xiii little gervais jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it
he set out at avery has typa cet hr ought he fields taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessantly retracing his steps
he wandered thus the whole morning without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry
he was the pre yof at hro ngo fno vel sensations
he was conscious of a sort of rage he did not know against whom it was directed
he could not have to ldw hether he was touched or humiliated
the rec am eo ver him at moments as trang eem oti o nw hich here sisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life
this state of mind fatigue dhi m
he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way with in him
he asked himself what would replace this
at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less
although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few late flowers in the hedgerows here and the re whose odor as he passed through the minh is march recalled to him memories of his childhood
the seme mori es were almost intolerable to him it was so long since the yha dre curred to him
unutterable thoughts assembled with in him in this manner all day long
as the sun dec line dto its setting casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted
the rewa snot hing on the horizon except the alps
note vent he spire of a distant village
jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from dapat hwh ichi nter sect edt he plain passed a few paces from the bush
in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not alittle to render his rags terrifying to anyone who might have encountered him a joyous sound became a udi ble
he turned his head and saw alittle savoyard about ten years of age coming up the path and singing his hurdy gurdy on his hip and his marmot box on his back
one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording a view of the irk nees through the holes in the irt rousers
without stopping his son gthe lad halted in his march from time to time and played at knuckle bones with some coins which he had in his hand his whole fortune probably
among this money there was one for tys oup iec e
the child halted beside the bush without perceiving jean valjean and tossed up his hand ful of sous which upto that time he had caught with a good deal of adroit nesson the back of his hand
this time the forty soup iec eesc ape dhi man dwe ntr olli ngt owa rds the brushwood until it reached jean valjean
jean valjean set his foot upon it
in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him
he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the man
the spot was absolutely solitary
as far as the eye could see the rewa snot apers on onthe plain or on the path
the only sound was the tiny feeble cries of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the heavens at an immense height
the child was standing with his back to the sun which cast thread so fg old in his hair and emp urp led with its blood red gleam the savage face of jean valjean
sir said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence my money
what is your name
said jean valjean
little gervais sir
go away said jean valjean
sir resume dthe child give me back my money
jean valjean dropped his head and made noreply
the child began again my money sir
jean valjean 's eyes remained fixed on the earth
my piece of money
cried the child my white piece
my silver
it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him
the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him
atthe sametime he made an effort to displace the big iron shod shoe which rested on his treasure

the child wept
jean valjean raised his head
he still remained seated
his eyes were troubled
he gazed at the child in a sort of amazement the nhes tre tche do uth is hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice who 's the re

the frightened child looked at him the nbe gant otr embl efr omh ead to foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry
nevertheless lack of breath for ced him to halt after a certain distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own rever y
atthe end of a few moments the child had disappeared
the sun had set
the shadows were descending around jean valjean
he had eaten nothing all day it is probable that he was feverish
he had remained standing and had not change dhis attitude after the child 's flight
the breath heaved his chest at long and irregular intervals
his gaze fixed tenor twelve pace sin front of him seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earth en war ewh ich had fallen in the grass
all at once he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening
he settled his cap more firmly on his brows ought mechanical lyt ocr ossa ndb utton his blouse advanced as tep and stopped to pick up his cudgel
at that moment he caught sight of the forty soup iec ewh ich his foot had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles

what is this
he muttered between his teeth
here coiled three pace sthe nha lte dwi thou tbe in gable to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittering the rein the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him
atthe expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coins ei zed it and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain atthe sametime casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge
he saw nothing
night was falling the plain was cold and vague great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight
he said a h
and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared
after about thirty pace she paused looked about him and saw nothing
the nhes hout ed with all his might little gervais
little gervais
he paused and waited
the rewa snore ply
the landscape was gloomy and deserted
he was encompassed by space
the rewa snot hing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost and as i lence which engulfed his voice
an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him as orto flu gu brio us life
the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury
one would have said that the yw ere threatening and pursuing some one
he set out on his march again the nhe began to run and from time to time he halted and shouted in to that solitude with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear little gervais
little gervais
assuredly ifthe child had heard him he would have been alarmed and would have taken good care not to show himself
but the child was no doubt already faraway
he encountered a priest on horseback
he stepped up to him and said monsieur le cure have you see nachi ldp as s
no said the priest
one named little gervais
ihave seen noone
he drew two five franc pieces from his money bag and handed the mto the priest
monsieur le cure this is for your poor people

jean valjean seized two more coins of five francs each with violence and gave the mto the priest
for your poor he said
the nhe added wildly monsieur l' abbe have me arrested
iam a thief
the priest puts pur sto his horse and fled in haste much alarmed
jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first taken
in this way he traverse dato lera bly longdistance gazing calling shouting but he met noone
two or three times her an across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being reclining or crouching down it turned out to be nothing but brushwood orrock sne arly on a level with the earth
at length at a spot where three paths intersected eachother he stopped
the moon had risen
he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time little gervais
little gervais
little gervais
his shout died away in the mist without even awakening an echo
he murmured yet once more little gervais
but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice
it was his last effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees and he cried iam a wretch
the nhis heart burst and he began to cry
it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years
when jean valjean left the bishop 's house he was a swe have seen quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto
he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on with in him
he hardened himself against the angelica ction and the gentle words of the old man
you have promised me to become an honest man
i buy your soul
it ake it away from the spirit of perversity igiv eit to the good god
this recurred to his mind unceasingly
to this celestial kindness he opposed pride which is the fortress of evil within us
he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable attack which had moved him yet that his obd urac yw as finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through soma ny years and which please dhi mth at this time it was necessary to conquer or to be conquered and that as tru ggl eac olo ssa land final struggle had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man
in the presence of the selig hts he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated
as he walked thus with haggard eyes did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventure at d
did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn or import une the spirit at certain moments of life
did a voice whisper in his earth at heh adjust passed the solemn hour of his destiny that the reno longer remain edam id dle course for him that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behoove dhi mno wso to speak to mount higher than the bishop or fall lower than the convict that if he wished to become good bemus tbe come ana nge lth at if he wished to remain evil he must be come amon ster
here again some questions must be put which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought i naco nfuse dwa y
misfortune certainly as we have said does form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated
if the seide as occurred to him he but caught glimpses of rather than saw the man dthe yon lys ucce ed edin throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion
one merging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop had hurt his soul as to ovi vidal ight would have hurt his eyes on emerging from the dark
the future life the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with tremors and anxiety
he nolonger knew where he really was
like an owl who should suddenly see the sunrise the convict had been dazzled and blinded as it were by virtue
that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was nolonger the same man that everything about him was changed that it was nolonger in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him
in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed him of his forty sous
why
he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were ofthe evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys are mna nto fim pulse are sult of what is called in static sac quired for ce
it was that and it was also perhaps even less than that
let us say it simply itwas not he who stole it was not the man itwas the beast who by habit and instinct had simply place dhis foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling amid soma ny novel and hitherto unheard of thought sbes etting it
when intelligence reawakened and beheld that action of the brute jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror
illustration awakened bawa ken edit was because strange phenomenon and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself in stealing the money from that child he had done at hing of which he was nolonger capable
however that maybe this last evil action had a decisive effect on him it abruptly traverse dth at chaos which he bore in his mind and dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and onthe other the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was ascertain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other
first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all bewildered like one whose eks to save himself he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him the nw he nh erec ognized the fact that this was impossible he halted in despair
atthe moment when he exclaimed iam a wretch
he had just perceived what he was an dhew as already separate dfr omh ims elf to such a degree that he seemed to himself to be nolonger anything more than a phantom and as if he had the rebe for ehi min flesh and blood the hideous galley convict jean valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects
excess of unhappiness had a swe have remarked made him in some sort avision ary
this then was in the nature of avision
he actually saw that jean valjean that sinister face before him
he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was an dhew as horrified by him
his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which rever yi ssop rof ound that it absorbs reality
one nolonger behold sthe object which one has before one and one sees as though apart from one 's self the figures which one has inone 's own mind
thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and atthe sametime athwart this hallucination he perceived in a mysterious depth as orto flight which he at first to okf orator ch
on scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention here cogni zed the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop
his conscience weighed in turn the set women thus place dbe for eit the bishop and jean valjean
nothing less than the first was required to soften the second
by one of those singular effects which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies in proportion as his rever yc ontinued as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow less and vanish
after a certain time he was nolonger anything more than a shade
all at once he disappeared
the bishop alone remained he filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance
jean valjean we ptf oral on gti me
he wept burning tears he sobbed with more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child
as he wept daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an extraordinary light alight at once ravishing and terrible
his past life his first fault his long expiation his external brutish ness his internal hard ness his dismissal to liberty rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance what had happened to him at the bishop 's the last thing that he had done that the fto ffor tys ous from a child acri meal lthe more cowardly and all the more monstrous since it had come after the bishop 's pardon all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him but with a clear ness which he had never hitherto witnessed
he examined his life and its eem ed horrible to him his soul and its eem edf right ful to him
in the meantime agent le light rested over this life and this soul
it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise
how many hours did he weep thus
what did he do after he had wept
whither did he go
noone ever knew
the only thing which seems to be authenticated is that that same night the carrier whose rv edg reno bleat that epoch and who arrived at dabo utt hree o'clock in the morning saw a she traverse dthe street in which the bishop 's residence was situated amani nthe attitude of prayer kneeling on the pavement in the shadow infront of the door of monseigneur welcome

this cookshop was kept by some people named the nardi erh usb and and wife

nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the cookshop of the sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of would certainly have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed that way
it was the fore carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wooded tracts of country and which serve to transport thick plan ksa ndt he trunks of trees
this for ecar riage was composed of amass ive iron axle tree with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and which was supported by two huge wheels

the gravedigger 's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child
the two women pursued their chat

where was she
what was she doing
after leaving her little cosette with the then a rdi ers she had continued her journey and had reached m
sur m
this it will be remembered was in
fantin ehad quitted her province ten years before
m
sur m
had changed its aspect
while fantin ehad been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness her native town had prospered
about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place
this detail is important and were gard it as useful to develop it at length we should almost say to underline it
from time immemorial m
sur m
had had for its special industry the imitation of english jet and the black glass trinkets of germany
this industry had always vegetated on account of the high price of the raw material which reacted on the manufacture
atthe moment when fantin ere turned to m
sur m
an unheard of transformation had taken place in the production of black goods
towards the close of amana stranger had established himself in the town and had been inspired with the idea of substituting in this manufacture gum lac for resin and for bracelets in particular slides of sheet irons imply laid together for slides of soldered sheet iron
this very small change had effected are volution
this very small change had infact prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material which had rendered it possible in the first place to raise the price of manufacture a benefit to the country in the second place to improve the workmanship an advantage to the consumer inthe third place to sell at a lower price while treb ling the profit which was a benefit to the manufacturer
thus three results ensued from one idea
in less than three years the inventor of this process had become rich which is good and had made everyone about him rich which is better
he was a stranger in the department
of his origin nothing was known of the beginning of his career very little
it was rumored that he had come to town with very little money afew hundred francs at the most
it was from this slender capital enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea developed by method and thought that he had drawn his own fortune and the fortune of the whole country side
on his arrival at m

he had only the garments the appearance and the language of a working man
it appears that onthe very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of m

just a tni ght fallon adec ember evening knapsack on back and thorn club in hand ala rge fire had broken out in the townhall
this man had rushed into the flames and save dat the risk of his own life two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport
afterwards the yha dle arne dhis name
he was called father madeleine
chapter ii madeleine he was a man about fifty years of age who had a preoccupied air and who was good
that was all that could be said about him
thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably reconstructed m
sur m
had become a rather important centre of trade
spain which consumes a good deal of black jet made enormous purchase sthe re each year
m
sur m
almost rivalled london and berlin in this branch of commerce
father madeleine 's profits were such that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory in which the re were two vast work rooms one for the men and the other for women
anyone who was hungry could present himself there and was sure of finding employment and bread
father madeleine required of the men goodwill of the women pure moral sand of all probity
he had separated the work rooms in order to separate the sexes and so that the women and girls might remain discreet
onthis point he was inflexible
it was the only thing in which he was in a manner in tolerant
he was all the more firmly set on this severity since m
sur m
being a garrison to wno pportunities for corruption abounded
however his coming had been a boon and his presence was a godsend

he allotted as a la ry from his own funds to the two instructors as a la ryt wic eas large as the irm eag re official salary and one day he said to someone who expressed surprise the two prime function aries of the state are the nurse and the school master
he created at his own expense an infant school at hing the nal most unknown in france and a fund for aiding old and infirm work men

when the ysa whim enriching the country before he enriched himself the goods oul ssa id he is an ambitious man
this seemed all the more probable since the man was religious and even practised his religion to acer tain degree at hing which was very favorably viewed at that epoch
he went regularly to low mass every sunday
the local deputy who nosed out all rivalry everywhere soon began to grow uneasy over this religion
this deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the empire and share dthe religious ideas of a father of the ora to ire known under the name of fouche duc d' otra nte whose creature and friend he had been
he indulged in gentle rail le rya tgo dwi thc lose ddo or s
but when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going to low mass at seven o'clock he perceived in him a possible candidate and resolved to outdo him he took a jesuit confessor and went to high mass and to vespers

wehave seen that the country owed much to him the poor owed him everything he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him
his work men in particular adored him and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity
when he was known to be rich people in society bowed to him and here ceived invitations in the town he was called into wn monsieur madeleine his work menand the children continue dto call him father madeleine and that was what was most adapted to make him smile

the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling the opinion of the whole country roundabout was so unanimous that the king again appointed him mayor of the town
he again declined but the prefect resisted his refusal all the not abilities of the place came to implore him the people in the street besought him the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting

this person grave with a gravity which was almost menacing was one of those men who even when only seen by a rapid glimpse arrest the spectator 's attention
his name was javert and he belonged to the police
at m
sur m
he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector
he had not seen madeleine 's beginning s
javert owed the post which he occupied tothe protection of m
cha bou ill et these creta ryo fthe minister of state comte angeles then prefect of police at paris
when javert arrived at m
sur m
the fortune of the great manufacturer was already made and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine
certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority
javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness
it is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual ofthe human race corresponds to someone ofthe species of the animal creation and we could easily recognize this truth hardly perceived by the thinker that from the oyster to the eagle from the pig to the tiger all animals exist in man and that each one of the mis in a man
sometimes even several of the mata time
animals are not hinge lse than the figures of our virtues and our vice sst ray in gbe for eou reyes the visible phantom so four souls
god shows the mto us inorder to induce us to reflect
only since animals are mere shadow sgod has not made the mca pab leo fed ucation in the full sense of the word what is the use
onthe contrary our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to the mgo dha sbes to wed on the mintel ligence that is to say the possibility of education
social education when we ll done canal ways draw from a soul of whatever sort it may be the utility which it contains
this beit said is ofcourse from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man
the visible iinn owi sea uthor izes the thinker to deny the late nti
having made this reservation let us pass on
now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in every man there is one of the animals pec ies of creation it will be easy for us to say what the rewa sin police officer javert
the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves the reis one dog which is killed by the mother because otherwise as he grew up he would devour the other little ones
give to this dogs on of a wolf a human face and the result will be javert
javert had been born in prison of a fortune teller whose husband was in the galleys
as he grew up het hough tth at hew as outside the pale of society and he despaired of ever reentering it
he observed that society un pardoning lye xcl ude st woc lasses of men those who attack it and those who guard it heh a dno choice except between the set woc lasses at the same time he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity regular it yand probity complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemia nsw hence he was sprung
he entered the police he succeeded there
at fort yy ears of age he was an inspector
during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishment soft he south
before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the words human face which we have just applied to javert
the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose with two deep nostrils towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks
one felt ill at ease when he saw the set wof or est sand these two caverns for the first time
when javert laughed and his laugh was rare and terrible his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth but his gums and around his nose there for me daf latte neda nds ava gef old as onthe muzzle of a wild beast
javert serious was a watchdog when he laughed he was a tiger
as for the rest he had very little skull and agreat deal of jaw his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows between his eyes there was a permanent central frown like an imprint of wrath his gaze was obscure his mouth purse dupa ndt err ible his air that offer ocio us command
this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments comparative ly but here nder edt he malmo st bad by dint of exaggerating the mres pect for authority hatred of rebellion and in his eyes murder robbery all crimes are only for mso fre bell ion
he envelope dina blind and profound faith everyone who had a function in the state from the prime minister to the rural policeman
he covered with scorn aversion and disgust everyone who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil
he was absolute and admitted no exceptions
onthe one hand he said the function ary can make no mistake the magistrate is never the wrong
onthe other hand he said the semen are irre media bly lost
nothing good can come from the m
he fully share dthe opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law iknow not what power of making or if the reader will have its oof authenticating demons and who place as ty xa tthe base of society
he was stoical serious austere am elan chol yd reamer humble and haughty like fanatics
his glance was like a gimlet cold and piercing
his whole life hung on the set wow or dsw at chf uln essa ndsu per vision
he had introduced as trai ght line into what is the most crooked thing in the world he possessed the conscience of his usefulness the religion of his functions and he was a spy as other men are priests
woe to the man who fell into his hands
he would have arrested his own father ifthe latter had escaped from the galleys and would have denounced his mother if she had broken her ban
and he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue
and with a la life of privation isolation abnegation chastity with never adi version
it was implacable duty the police understood as the spartans understood sparta api tiles sly in gin wait a ferocious honesty amar ble in former brutus in vid oc q
javert 's whole person was expressive of the man who spies and who withdraws himself from observation
the mystical school of joseph de maistre which at that epoch season ed with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers would not have failed to declare that javert was a symbol
his brow was not visible it disappeared beneath his hat his eyes were not visible since the yw ere lost under his eyebrows his chin was not visible for it was plunged in his cravath is hands were not visible they were drawn up in his sleeves and his cane was not visible he carried it under his coat
but when the occasion presented itself there was suddenly see nto emerge from all this shadow as from an ambu scad ean arrow and angular forehead aba le ful glance at hrea ten in gch in enormous hands and amon str ous cudgel
in his leisure moments which were far from frequent here adalt hough he hated books this caused him to be not wholly illiterate
this could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech
as we have said he had no vices
when he was pleased with himself he permitted himself a pinch of snuff
the rein lay his connection with humanity
the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that javert was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry of justice design at esu nder the rubric vagrants
the name of javert route dthe mb yit sme reutter an cet he face of javert petrified the mats ight
such was this formidable man
javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m
madeleine
an eyeful lof suspicion and conjecture
m
madeleine had finally perceived the fact but it seemed to be of no importance to him
he did not even put a question to javert he neither sought nora voided him he bore that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze with out appearing to notice it
he treated javert with ease and courtesy as he did all the rest of the world
it was divine dfr oms ome words which escaped javert that he had secretly investigated with that curiosity which belongs to the race and into which the reenter sas much instinct as will all the anterior traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere
he seemed to know and he sometimes said in covert words that someone had gleaned certain information in acer tain district about a family which had disappeared
once he chanced to say as he was talking to himself ithink ihave him
the nhe remained pensive for three days and uttered not a word
it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken
moreover and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the too absolute sense which certain words might present the rec an ben othing really infallible in a human creature and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can be comecon fused thrown off the track and defeated
otherwise it would be superior to intelligence and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man
javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect natural ness and tranquillity of m
madeleine
one day nevertheless his strange man nera ppe are dto produce a nim press ion on m
madeleine
it was on the following occasion
chapter vi father fau che le vent on emo rning m
madeleine was passing through an unpaved all eyo fm
sur m
hehe ardan oise and saw a group some distance away
he approached
an old man named father fau che le vent had just fallen beneath his car this horse having tumbled down
this fau che le vent was one of the few enemies who mm
madeleine had a tth at time
when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood fau che le vent an ex not aryan dap easa nt who was almost educated had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way
fau che le vent had seen this simple workman grow rich while he ala wyer was being ruined
this had filled him with jealousy and he had done all he could one very occasion to injure madeleine
the nba nkr up tc yha dcom eand as the old man had nothing left but acar tanda horse and neither family nor children he had turned carter
the horse had two broken leg sand could not rise
the old man was caught in the wheels
the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast
the car twas quite heavily laden
father fau che le vent was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner
the yha dtr ie dbu tin vain to drag him out
an unmet hod ical effort aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him
it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle of fof him
javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for a jacks crew
m
madeleine arrived
people stood aside respectfully
help
cried old fau che le vent
who will be good and save the old man
m
madeleine turned towards those present is the rea jack screw to be had
one has been sent for answered the peasant
how long will it take to get it
the yha veg one for the nearest to flach ot 's place where the reis afar rier but it makes no difference it will take a good quarter of an hour
aqua rte rof an hour
exclaimed madeleine
it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked
the car twas sinking deeper into the earth every moment and crushing the old carter 's breast more and more
it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more
it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to the peasants who were staring at him
we must
but it will be too late then
don't you see that the car tiss in king
well

the person spre sent dropped the ire yes
one of the mmu tter edam an would need to be devilish strong
and the nhe runs the risk of getting crushed
come began madeleine again twenty louis
the same silence
it is not the will which is lacking said a voice
m
madeleine turned round and recognized javert
he had not noticed him on his arrival
javert went on it is strength
one would have to be at err ible man to do such a thing as lift a car tli ket hat on his back
the nga zing fixed lya tm
madeleine he went on emphasizing every word that he uttered monsieur madeleine ihave never know nbu to nema ncap able of doing what you ask
madeleine shuddered
javert added with an air of indifference but without removing his eyes from madeleine he was a convict
ah
said madeleine
in the galleys at toulon
madeleine turned pale
meanwhile the car tcon tinued to sinks low ly
father fau che le vent rattled in the throat and shrieked iams trang ling
my ribs are breaking
as crew
something
ah
madeleine glance dabo uth im
isthe re then noone who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man
noone stirred
javert resume di have never know nbu to nema nw hoc ould take the place of a screw and he was that convict
ah
it is crushing me
cried the old man
madeleine raised his head met javert 's falcon eyes till fixed upon him looked at the motion less peasants and smiled sadly
the nwi thou tsay in gaw or dhe fell on his knees and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry he was underneath the vehicle
at err ible moment of expectation and silence ensued
the ybe held madeleine almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight make two vain effort stob ring his knees and his elbows together
the ys hout edt ohim father madeleine come out
old fau che le vent himself said to him monsieur madeleine go away
you see that i am fated to die
leave me
you will get your self crushed also
madeleine made noreply
all the spectators were panting
the wheels had continued to sink and it had become almost impossible for madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle
suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver the car tro ses low lyth ewh eels half emerged from the ruts
the yhe arda stifled voice crying make haste
help
it was made lein ewh ohad just made a final effort
the yr us he dfor wards
the devotion of asin gle man had given for cea ndc our age to all
the car twas raised by twenty arms
old fau che le vent was saved
madeleine rose
he was pale though dripping with perspiration
his clothes were to rna ndc over ed with mud
all we pt
the old man kissed his knees and called him the good god
as for him he bore upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering and he fixed his tranquil eye on javert who was still staring at him
chapter vii fau che le vent becomes a gardener in paris fau che le vent had dislocated his knee panin his fall
father madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his work men in the factory building itself and which was served by two sisters of charity
onthe following morning the old man found at hous and franc banknote on his nightstand with the sew or dsi nfat her madeleine 's writing ip urchase your horse and car t
the car twas broken and the horse was dead
fau che le vent recovered but his knee remained stiff
m
madeleine on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest got the good man aplac eas garden erin a female convent in the rue saint antoine in paris
sometime after wards m
madeleine was appointed mayor
the first time that javert beheld m
madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town he felt the sort of shudder which a watchdog might experience on smelling a wolf in his master 's clothes
from that time for thhe avoided him as much as he possibly could
when the requirements of the service imperative lyde man dedit and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor headdress ed him with profound respect
this prosperity created at m
sur m
by father madeleine had besides the visible signs which we have mentioned another symptom which was nonetheless significant for not being visible
this never deceive s
when the population suffers when work is lacking when the reis nocom merce the taxpayer resists imposts through penury he exhaust sand over steps his respite and the state expends agreat deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection
when work is abundant when the country is rich and happy the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing
it may be said that the reis one infallible thermometer of the public misery and richest he cost of collecting the taxes
in the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three fourths in the arrondissement of m
sur m
and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by m
deville let he nmi nist ero ffi nance
such was the condition of the country when fantin ere turned thither
noone remember edhe r
fortunately the door of m
madeleine 's factory was like the face of a friend
she presented herself there and was admitted to the women 's work room
the trade was entirely new to fantin esh eco uld not be very skilful at it and she therefore earned but little by her day 's work but it was sufficient the problem was solved she was earning her living
chapter viii madame vic turn ie nex pends thirty francs on morality when fantin esa wth a tsh ewa sma king her living she felt joyful for a moment

the taste for work had really returned to her
she bought a look in ggl as sto ok pleasure in surveying in it her youth herbeau tiful hair her fine teeth she forgot many things she thought only of cosette and ofthe possible future and was almost happy
she hired alittle room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work ali nger in gtr ace of her improvident ways
as she was not able to say that she was married she took good care as we have seen not to mention her little girl
at first asthe reader has seen she paid the then a rdi ers promptly
as she only knew how to sign her name she was obliged to write through a public letter writer
she wrote often and this was not iced
it began to be said in an undertone in the women 's work room that fantin ewr otel etters and that she had ways about her
the reis noone for spying on people 's actions like those who are not concerned in the m
why does that gentleman never come except at night fall
why does mr

it was remarked that in the work rooms he often turned aside in the midst of the rest to wipe away at ear
the sewer ethe moments when she was thinking of her child perhaps also ofthe man who ms he had loved
breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task
it was observed that she wrote twice a month atleast and that she paid the carriage on the letter

she was dry rough peevish sharp capt ious almost venomous all this in memory of her monk who sew id ows he was an dwh ohad ruled over her master fully and bent her to his will
she was an ett lein which the rustle of the cassock was visible
atthe restoration she had turned big otan dth at with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk
she had a small property which she bequeathed with much ostentation to are ligi ous community
she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of arras
so this madame vic turn ie nwe ntt omo nt ferme ilan dre turned with the remark ihave seen the child
all this took time
fantin ehad been at the factory for more than a year when one morning the superintendent of the work room handed her fifty francs from the mayor to ldh erth at shew as nolonger employed in the shop and requested her in the mayor 's name to leave the neighborhood
this was the very month when the then a rdi ersa fter having demanded twelve francs instead of six had just exact edf if teen francs instead of twelve

the mayor had given her fifty francs because he was good and had dismissed her because he was just
she bowed before the decision
chapter ix madame vic turn ie n ' s success so the monk 's widow was good for something
but m
madeleine had heard nothing of all this
life is full of just such combinations of events
m
madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women 's work room
atthe head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster who mthe priest had provided for him and he had full confidence in this superintendent at rul yr espe ctab lepers on firm equitable upright full of the charity which consists in giving but not having inthe same degree that charity which consists in understanding and info rgi ving
m
madeleine relied wholly on her
the best men are often obliged to delegate the ira uthority
it was with this full power and the conviction that she was doing right that the superintendent had instituted the suit judge dc on dem neda ndex ecu ted fantin e
as regards the fifty francs she had given the mfr omaf und which m
madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes and forgiving assistance to the work women and of which she rendered no account

the household erw homs he owed for her rent said to her you are you ngan dpr etty you can pay
she divided the fifty francs between the landlord and the furniture dealer returned to the latter three quarters of his good ske pto nly necessaries and found herself with out work with out at rade with nothing but he rbe dan dst ill about fifty francs in debt
she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison and earned twelve sousa day
her daughter cost her ten
it was a tth is point that she began to pay the then a rdi ers irregularly

when she was in the streets he divine dth at people turned round behind her and pointed at her everyone stared at her and noone greeted her the cold and bitter scorn of the passersby penetrated her very flesh and soul like an orth wind
it seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small town s
in paris atleast noone know syo uand this obscurity is a garment
oh
how she would have liked to be take herself to paris
impossible
she was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute as she had accustomed herself to indigence
gradually she decided on her course
atthe expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame and began to go about as though the re were not hing the matter
it is all the same to meshes aid
she went and came bearing her head well up with a bitter smile and was conscious that she was becoming brazen faced
madame vic turn ie nso met imes saw her passing from her window notice dthe distress of that creature who thanks to her had been put back in her proper place and congratulated herself

she had long shared the universal veneration for father madeleine yet by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her that he was the cause of her unhappiness she came to hate him also an dmos to fall
when she passed the factory in working hours when the work people were at the doors he affected to laugh and sing
an old work woman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said the re 's a girl who will come to a bad end

the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounge rand taking advantage of a moment when he rbac kwa stu rne dhec rept up behind her with the gait of a wolf and stifling his laugh be ntd own picked up a handful of snow from the pavement and thrust it abruptly in to her back between her bare shoulders
the woman uttered a roar whirled round gave a leap like a panther and hurled herself upon the man burying her nails in his face with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard room into the gutter
the seins ult spo ured for thin avo ice roughened by brand ydi din deed proceed in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth
it was fantin e
atthe noise thus produced the office rsr an out in throngs from the cafe passersby collected and alar gea nd merry circle hooting and applauding was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings who mthe re was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman them an struggling his hat on the ground the woman striking out with feet and fists bareheaded howling minus hair and teeth livid with wrath horrible
suddenly amano flo ft yst at ure emerged vivaciously from the crowd seized the woman by her satin bodice which was covered with mud and said to her follow me
the woman raised her head her furious voices ud den lydie dawa y

she had recognized javert

chapter xiii the solution of some questions connected with the municipal police javert thrust aside the spectators broke the circle and set out with long strides towards the police station which is situated at the extremity of the square dragging the wretched woman after him
she yielded mechanical ly
neither he nor she uttered a word
the cloud of spectators followed jesting in a paroxysm of delight
supreme misery an occasion for obscenity
on arriving at the police station which was a low room warmed by a stove with a glazed and grated door opening on the street and guarded by a detachment javert opened the door entered with fantin eand shut the door behind him to the great disappointment of the curious who raised the mse lve son tiptoe and crane dthe irn ecks infront of the thick glass of the station house in the ire ffor tto see
curiosity is a sort of gluttony
to see is to devour
one nter in gfa nti nef ell down in acorn erm oti o nle ssa nd mute crouching down like a terrified dog
the sergeant of the guard brought alighted candle to the table
javert seated himself drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket and began to write
this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police
the latter do what they please punish the mass eem sgo odt othe man dc on fisc at eat their will those two sorry things which the yen title their industry and the irl ibert y
javert was impassive his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever
nevertheless he was seriously and deeply preoccupied
it was one of those moments when he was exercising with out control but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience his redoubtable discretionary power
at that moment he was conscious that his police agent 's stool was a tribunal
he was entering judgment
he judged and condemned
he summoned all the idea sw hich could possibly exist in his mind around the great thing which he was doing
the more he examined the deed of this woman them or esh ock edhe felt
it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime
he had just beheld yonder in the streets ociety in the person of a free holder and an elector in sulted and attacked by acre at ure who was outside all pale s
apr osti tute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen
he had seen that he javert
he wrote in silence
when he had finished he signed the paper folded it and said to the sergeant of the guard as he handed it to him take three men and conduct this creature to jail

the unhappy woman shuddered
six months
six months of prison
she exclaimed
six months in which to earn seven sousa day
but what will be come of cosette
my daughter
my daughter
but is till owe the then a rdi ers over a hundred francs do you know that monsieur inspector
she dragged her self across the damp floor among the muddy boots of all those men without rising with clasped hands and taking great strides on her knees
monsieur javert said she ibes eec hyo urm erc y
ias sure you that i was not in the wrong
if you had seen the beginning you would have seen
is wear to you by the good god that i was not to blame
that gentleman the bourgeois who mid on otk now puts now in my back
hasan yon ether ight to put snow down our backs when we are walking along peaceably and doing no harm to anyone
iam rather ill as you see
and the nhe had been saying impertinent things to me for along time ' you are ugly
you have not eet h
' iknow well that ihave nolonger those teeth
id id nothing is a idt omy self ' the gentleman is amusing himself
' iwas honest with him id id not speak to him
it was a tth at moment that he put the snow down my back
monsieur javert good monsieur inspector
isthe reno tso me person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true
perhaps i did wrong to get angry
you know that one is not master of one 's self atthe first moment
one gives way to vivacity and the nw hens omeo nep uts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it
id id wrong to spoil that gentleman 's hat
why did he goa way
iwould ask his pardon
oh my god
it makes no difference to me whether i ask his pardon
dome the favor today for this once monsieur javert
hold
you do not know that in prison on eca near non lys even so usa day it is not the government 's fault but seven sous is one 's earnings and just fancy imus tpa yon eh und red francs or my little girl will be sent to me
oh my god
icann otha veh erw it hme

oh my little angel of the holy virgin

iwill tell you itis the then a rdi ers innkeepers peasants and such people are unreasonable
the yw an tmo ney
don't put me in prison
you see the reis alittle girl who will be turned out into the street to get along as best she may inthe very heart of the winter and you must have pity on such a being my good monsieur javert
if she were older she might earn her living but it can not be done at that age
iam not a bad woman at bottom
it is not coward lines sand gluttony that have made me what i am
if i have drunk brand yit was out of misery
id on otl ove it but it be numb sthe sense s
when i was happy itwas only necessary to glance into my closet sand it would have been evident that i was not a coquettish and untidy woman
i had line nag re at deal of line n
have pity on memo nsi eur javert
she spoke thus rent in twain shaken with sobs blinded with tears her neck bare wringing her hands and coughing with a dry short coughs tamm erin gso ft ly with a voice of agony
great sorrow is a divine and terrible ray which transfig ures the unhappy
at that moment fantin ehad become beautiful once more
from time to time she paused and tenderly kissed the police agent 's coat
she would have softened a heart of granite but a heart of wood can not be softened
come
said javert ihave heard you out
have you entirely finished
you will get six months
now march
the eternal father in person could do not hing more
atthe ses ole mn words the eternal father in person could do not hing more she understood that he rfa tewa sse aled
she sank down murmuring mercy
javert turned his back
the soldiers seized her bythe arms
afew moments earlier aman had entered but noone had paid any heed to him
he shut the door leaned his back against it and listened to fantin e 's despairing supplications
atthe instant when the soldiers laid the ir hands upon the unfortunate woman who would not rise he emerged from the shadow and said one moment ifyou please
javert raised his eyes and recognized m
madeleine
here moved his hat and saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness excuse me mr
mayor the words mr
mayor produced a curious effect upon fantin e
she rose to her feet with one bound like aspect resp ringing from the earth thrust aside the soldiers with both arms walked straight up to m
madeleine before anyone could prevent her and gazing in tently at him with a bewildered air she cried a h
so it is you who are m
lemaire
the nsh ebu rst into a laugh and spit in his face
m
madeleine wiped his face and said inspector javert set this woman at liberty
javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad
he experienced at that moment blow up on blow and almost simultaneously the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life
to see a woman of the town spit in the mayor 's face was a thing so monstrous that in his most daring flights of fancy he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible
onthe other hand at the very bottom of his thought he made a hideous comparison as to what this woman was an das to what this may or might be an dthe nh ewi th horror caught a glimpse of iknow not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack
but when he beheld that may or that magistrate calmly wipe his face and says et this woman at liberty he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement thought and word failed him equally the sumtotal of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case
here maine dmu te
the words had produced no less strange an effect on fantin e
she raised her bare armand clung to the damper of the stove like a person who is reeling
nevertheless she glanced about her and began to speak in a low voice as though talking to herself at liberty
iam to be allowed to go
iam not to go to prison for six months
who said that
it is not possible that anyone could have said that
id id not hear aright
it can not have been that monster of a mayor
was it you my good monsieur javert who said that i was to be set free
oh see here
iwill tell you about it and you will let me go
that monster of a mayor that old black guard of a mayor is the cause of all
just imagine monsieur javert he turned me out
all because of a pack of rascally women who gossip in the work room
if that is not a horror what is
to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly
the nico uld nolonger earn enough and all this misery followed
in the first place the reis one improvement which the seg ent leme no fthe police ought to make and that is to prevent prison contractors from wrong in gpo or people
iwill explain it to you you see you are earning twelve sousa tshirt making the price falls to nine sousa ndi tis not enough to live on
the non eha stob ecom ewha tev eron eca n
as for me i had my little cosette and iwasa ctu all yfor ced to become a bad woman
now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a mayor caused all the mischief
after that is tamped on that gentleman 's hat infront of the office rs ' cafe but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow
we women have but one silk dress for evening wear
you see that i did not do wrong deliberately truly monsieur javert and everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than ian dwh oare much happier
omo nsi eur javert
it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free was it not
make inquiries speak to my landlord iam paying my rent now they will tell you that i am perfectly honest
ah
my god
i beg your pardon ihave unintentionally touched the damper of the stove and it has made it smoke
m
madeleine listened to her with profound attention
while she was speaking he fumbled in his waistcoat drew out his purse and opened it
it was empty
he put it back in his pocket
he said to fantin ehow much did you say that you owe d
fantin ewh owa slo okin gat javert only turned towards him was isp eakin gto you
the nad dressing the soldiers say you fellows did you see how is pit in his face
ah
you old wretch of a mayor you came here to frighten me but i 'm not afraid of you
iam a fraid of monsieur javert
iam a fraid of my good monsieur javert
so saying she turned to the inspector again and yet you see mr
inspector it is necessary to be just
i understand that you are just mr
inspector in fact it is perfectly simple amana muses himself by putting snow down a woman 's back and that makes the office rsl aug hone must divert the mse lve sins ome way and we well wear eher efor the mto amuse themselves with ofcourse
and the ny ou you come you are certainly obliged to preserve order you leadoff the woman who is in the wrong but on reflection since you are ago odma ny ousa yth at iam to be set at liberty it is for the sake of the little one for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child
' only don't do it again you hussy
' oh
iwon ' tdo it again monsieur javert
the yma yd ow hate vert hey please tome now iwill not stir
but today you see icri ed because it hurt me
iwas not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all and the nas it old you iam not well ihave a cough is eem to have a burning ball in my stomach and the doctor tells me ' take care of yourself
' here feel give me your hand don't be afraid it is here
she nolonger we pthe rv oic ewa scares sings he placed javert 's coarse hand on her delicate white throat and looked smiling lya thi m
all at once she rapidly adjusted her disorder edgar ments dropped the folds of her skirt which had been pushed up as she dragged her self along almost to the height of her knee and stepped towards the doors ayin gto the soldiers in a low voice and with a friend lyn odc hildren monsieur l' inspecteur has said that i am to be released and i am going
she laid her hand on the latch of the door
one step more and she would be in the street
javert upto that moment had remained erect motionless with his eyes fixed on the ground cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue which is waiting to be put away somewhere
the sound of the latch roused him
her aise dhis head with an expression of sovereign authority an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rest sonal owl eve lfe rocio us in the wild beast atrocious in the man of noes tate
sergeant
he cried don't you see that that jade is walking off
who bad eyo ule the rgo
is a idm adele in e
fantin etre mb led atthe sound of javert 's voice and let go ofthe latch as a thief relinquishes the article which he has stolen
atthe sound of madeleine 's voice she turned around and from that moment for ths he uttered now or dno rda red som uch as to breathe freely but he rgl ances tray edf rom madeleine to javert and from javert to madeleine in turn according to which was speaking
it was evident that javert must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to apo strop hi zet he sergeant as he had done after the mayor 's suggestion that fantin esh ould be set at liberty
had her each edt he point of forgetting the mayor 's presence
had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any authority should have given such an order and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another without intending it
or in view of the enorm it ies of which he had been a witness for the past two hours did he say to himself that it was necessary to recur to supreme resolution sth at it was indispensable that the small should be made great that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate that the police man should be come adis penser of justice and that in this prodigious extremity order law morality government society in its entirety was personified in him javert
however that maybe when m
madeleine uttered that word ias wehave just heard police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the mayor pale cold with blue lips and a look of despair his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence and say to him with downcast eyes but afirm voice mr
mayor that can not be
why not
said m
madeleine
this miserable woman has insulted aci ti zen
inspector javert replied the mayor in a calm and concil iat in gto nelis ten
you are an honest man and if eel no hesitation in explaining matters to you
here is the true state of the case iwas passing through the square just as you were leading this woman away the re were still groups of people standing about and imad ein qui ries and learned everything it was the town sma nw how asin the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police
javert retorted this wretch has just insulted monsieur le maire
that concerns me said m
madeleine
my own insult belongs to me it hink
ican do what i please about it
i beg monsieur le maire 's pardon
the insult is not to him but to the law
inspector javert replied m
madeleine the highest law is conscience
ihave heard this woman iknow what i am doing
and i mr
mayor don otk now what is ee
the nco nte nt yourself with obeying
iam obeying my duty
my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison
m
madeleine replied gently heed this well she will not serve as in gle day
at this decisive word javert venture dto fix a search in glo okon the mayor and to say but in a tone of voice that was still profoundly respectful iams or ryt oop pose monsieur le maire it is for the first time in my life but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my authority
icon fine myself since monsieur le maire desires it to the question of the gentleman
iwas present
this woman flung herself on monsieur bama tab no is whois an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony which forms the corner of the esplanade three stories high and entirely of cuts to ne
such things as the rear ein the world
in any case monsieur le maire this is a question of police regulations in the streets and concerns mean dish all detain this woman fantin e
the nm
madeleine folded his arms and said in a severe voice which noone in the town had heard hitherto the matter to which you refer iso necon nected with the municipal police
according to the terms of articles nine eleven fifteen and sixty six of the code of criminal examination iam the judge
iord erth at this woman shall be set at liberty
javert venture dto make a final effort
but mr
mayor ire fer you to article eight yon eof the law of the tho fde cember in regard to arbitrary detention
monsieur le maire permit me not another word
but leave the rooms aid m
madeleine
javert received the blower ect full inthe face in his breast like a russian soldier
he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room
fantin est ood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed
nevertheless she also was the pre yto astra nge confusion
she had just seen herself as ub ject of dispute between two opposing power s
she had seen two men who held in the ir hands her liberty her life hers oul her child in combat before her very eyes on eof the semen was drawing her towards darkness the other was leading her back to ward sthe light
in this conflict viewed through the exaggeration softer ror the set women had appeared to her like two giants the ones poke like her demon the other like her good angel
the angel had conquered the demon and strange to say that which made her shudder from head to foot was the fact that this angel this liberator was the very man who ms he abhorred that may or who ms he had solo ngr eg a rde das the author of all her woe sth at madeleine
and atthe very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous afas hi on heh ads ave dhe r
had she then been mistaken
must she change her whole soul
she did not know she trembl ed
she listened in bewilderment she looked on in affright and at every word uttered by m
madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt with in her and something warm and ineffable indescribable which was both joy confidence and loved a wn in her heart
when javert had taken his departure m
madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking ihave heard you
i knew nothing about what you have mentioned
i believe that it is true and if eel that it is true
iwas even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop

oh
poor woman
this was more than fantin eco uld be a r
to have cosette
to leave this life of infamy
to live free rich happy respectable with cosette to see all the sere ali ties of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery
she stared stupid lya tth is man who was talking to her and could only give vent to two or three sobs oh
oh
oh
her limbs gave way beneath her she knelt in front of m
madeleine and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it
the nsh efa in ted
books i xth
javert chapter ithe beginning of repose m
madeleine had fantin ere moved to that infirmary which he had established in his own house
he confided her to the sisters who put her to be d
abu rning fever had come on
she passed apart of the night in delirium and raving
at length however she fell asleep
onthe morrow towards midday fantin eaw ok e
she heard someone breathing close to her bed she drew aside the curtain and saw m
madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head
his gaze was full of pity anguish and supplication
she followed its direction and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was nailed to the wall
the nce for thm
madeleine was transfigured infant in e 's eyes
he seemed to her to be clothed in light
he was absorbed in a sort of prayer
she gazed at him for along time without daring to interrupt him
atlas tsh esa id timidly what are you doing
m
madeleine had been there for an hour
he had been waiting for fantin et oa wake
he took her hand felt of her pulse and replied how do you feel
well ihave slept she replied ithink that i am better it is not hing
he answered responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it iwas praying to the martyr the reon high
and head de dinh is own mind for the martyr here below
m
madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries
he knew all now
he knew fantin e 's history in all its heartrending details
he went on you have suffered much poor mother
oh
don otc omp lain you now have the dowry of the elect
it is thus that men are transformed into angels
it is not the irfa ult the yd on otk now howto goto work otherwise
you see this hell from which you have just emerged is the first for mof heaven
it was necessary to begin the re
he sighed deeply
but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking
that same night javert wrote a letter
the next morning be posted it himself at the office of m
sur m
it was addressed to paris and the superscript ion rant omo nsi eur cha bou ill ets ecretary of monsieur le pre feto fpo lice
as the affair in the station house had been bruite dabo utt he post mistress and some other person sw hosa wthe letter before it was sent off and who recognized javert 's handwriting on the cover thought that he was sending in his resignation
m
madeleine made haste to write to the then a rdi ers

he sent them three hundred francs telling the mto pay themselves from that suman dto fetch the child instantly to m

m
madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more and wrote make haste to bring cosette
chris ti
said the nardi erle t 's not give up the child
in the meantime fantin edi dno trec over
she still remained in the infirmary
the sisters had a tfi rst only received and nursed that woman with repugnance
those who have seen the bas relief so fr he ims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgin sast hey survey the foolish virgin s
the ancient scorn of the vestal sfor the ambu baja eis one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion
but in a few days fantin edis armed them
she said all kinds of humble and gentle things and the mother in her provoked tenderness
one day the sisters heard her say amid her fever ihave been asin ner but when i have my child beside me it will be as i gnt hat god has pardoned me
while i was leading abad life is hould not have liked to have my cosette with me ico uld not have borne her sad astonished eyes
it was for her sake that i did evil and that is why god pardons me
is hall feel the benediction of the good god when cosette is here
is hall gaze at her it will do me good to see that innocent creature
sheknows nothing at all
she is an angel you see my sister s
at that age the wings have not fallen off
m
madeleine went to see her twice a day and each time she asked him shall is eem ycos ette soon
he answered tomorrow perhaps
she may arrive at any moment
iam expecting her
and the mother 's paleface grew radiant
oh
she said how happy iam going to be
wehave just said that she did not recover her health
onthe contrary her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week
that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder blades had brought about as ud den suppression of perspiration as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last
at that time people were beginning to follow the fine la en nec 's fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies
the doctor sounded fantin e 's chest and shook his head
m
madeleine said to the doctor well
has she not a child which she desires to see
said the doctor
yes
well
make haste and get it here
m
madeleine shuddered
fantin ein quired what did the doctor say
m
madeleine for ced himself to smile
he said that you rch il dwa stob ebro ugh tsp eed il y
that that would restore your health

she rejoined he is right

in the meantime the nardi erd id not let go ofthe child and gave a hundred insufficient reasons for it

he wrote the following letter to fantin e 's dictation and made her sign it monsieur the nardi ery ou will deliver cosette to this person

in the meantime as eri ous incident occurred
car veas we will the mysterious block of which our life is made the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it
chapter ii how jean maybe come champ one morning m
madeleine was in his study occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor 's office in case he should decide to take the trip to mont ferme il when he was informed that police inspector javert was desirous of speaking with him
madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impression on hearing this name
javert had avoided him more than ever since the affair of the police station and m
madeleine had not seen him
admit him he said
javert entered
m
madeleine had retained his seat near the fire pen in hand his eyes fixed on the docket which he was turning over and annotating and which contained the trial soft he commission on highway sfor the infraction of police regulations
he did not disturb him self on javert 's account
he could not help thinking of poor fantin eand its uite dhi mto be glacial in his manner
javert bestowed are spec tfu lsa lute on the mayor who seba ck was turned to him
the mayor did not look at him but we nto nanno tating this docket
javert advanced two or three pace sin to the study and halted without breaking the silence
if any physio gno mist who had been familiar with javert and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization this singular composite of the roman the spartan the monk and the corporal this spy who was incapable of a lie this unspotted police agent if any physio gno mist had known his secret and long cherished aversion for m
madeleine his conflict with the mayor on the subject of fantin eand had examined javert at that moment he would have said to himself what has taken place
it was evident to anyone acquainted with that clear upright since re honest austere and ferocious conscience that javert had but just gone through some great interior struggle
javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance
like violent people in general he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion
his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling
one nter in ghe bowed to m
madeleine with a look in which the rewa sne it her rancor anger nord is trust he halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor 's armchair and the re he stood perfectly erect in an attitude almost of discipline with the cold ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient he waited with out uttering a word without making a movement in genuine humility and tranquil resignation calm serious hatin hand with eyes cast down and an expression which was halfway between that of a soldier in the presence of his office rand acri min al inthe presence of his judge until it should please them a yor to turn round
all the sentiments as well as a llt he memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared
that face as impenetrable and simple as granite nolonger bore any trace of anything but am elan chol yd epr ession
his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency
atlas tthe mayor laid down his pen and turned half round
well
what is it
what is the matter javert
javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity which did not however precludes implicit y
this is the matter mr
mayor a culpable act has been committed
what act
an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect and in the gravest manner towards a magistrate
ihave come to bring the fact to your knowledge as it is my duty to do
whois the agent
asked m
madeleine
is a idj avert
you
i
and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent
you mr
mayor
m
madeleine sat erect in his armchair
javert went on with a severe air and his eyes still cast down
mr
mayor ihave come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me
m
madeleine opened his mouth in amazement
javert interrupted him you will say that i might have handed in my resignation but that does not suffice
handing in one 's resignation is honorable
ihave failed in my duty iou ght to be punished imus tbe turned out
and after a pause head de dmr
mayor you were severe with me the other day and unjustly
be so today with justice
come now
why
exclaimed m
madeleine
what nonsense is this
what is the meaning of this
what culpable act have you been guilty of towards me
what have you do net ome
what are you rw rongs with regard to me
you accuse you rse lfy ou wish to be superseded turned out said javert
turned out so it be the n
that is well
id on otu nder stand
you shall understand mr
mayor
javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest and resume dst ill cold lya nds adly mr
mayor six weeks ago in consequence of the scene over that woman iwas furious and i informed against you
informed against me
atthe prefecture of police in paris
m
madeleine who was not in the habit of laughing much of ten erth an javert himself burst out laughing now as a mayor who had encroached on the province of the police
as an ex convict
the mayor turned livid
javert who had not raised his eyes went on it hough tit was so
i had had an idea for along time are semblance inquiries which you had caused to be made at favero lles the strength of your loins the adventure with old fau che le van tyo urs killin marksmanship your leg which you drag alittle iha rd lyk now what all absurdities
but at all events it ook you for acer tain jean valjean
acer tain what did you say the name was
jean valjean
he was a convict who miwa sin the habit of seeing twenty years ago when i was adjutant guard of convicts at toulon
on leaving the galleys this jean valjean as it appears robbed a bishop the nhe committed another theft accompanied with violence on a public highway on the person of alittle savoyard
he disappeared eight years ago noone know show and he has been sought if an cie d
in short id id this thing
wrath impelled meiden ounce dyo uat the prefecture
m
madeleine who had taken up the docket again several moments before this resumed with an air of perfect indifference and what reply did you receive
that i was mad
well
well they were right
it is lucky that you recognize the fact
iam for ced to do so since the real jean valjean has been found
the sheet of paper which m
madeleine was holding dropped from his hand her aise dhis head gazed fixed lya tj avert and said with his indescribable accent ah
javert continued this is the way it is mr
mayor
it seems that the rewa sin then eigh borhood near a ill yle haut cloche ran old fellow who was called father champ mathieu
he was avery wretched creature
noone paid any attention to him
noone know sw hats uch people subsist on
lately last autumn father champ mathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apple sfr om well noma tter at heft had been committed a wall scale dbr anche soft rees broken
my champ mathieu was arrested
he still had the branch of appletree in his hand
the scampi sloc ked up
upto this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor
but here is where providence intervened
the jail being in a bad condition the examining magistrate find sit convenient to transfer champ mathieu to arras where the department al prison is situated
in this prison at a rras the reis an ex convict name dbr eve twh ois detained for iknow not what and who has been appointed turnkey of the house because of good behavior
mr
mayor no sooner had champ mathieu arrived than brevet exclaims ' eh
why i know that man
he is a fago t
take a good look at me my good man
you are jean valjean
' ' jean valjean
who 's jean valjean
' champ mathieu feigns astonishment
'd on ' tpl ayth ein no cent dodge 's a ys brevet
' you are jean valjean
you have been in the galleys of toulon it was twenty years ago we were there together
' champ mathieu denies it
par bleu
you understand
the case is investigated
the thing was well ventilated for me
this is what they discovered this champ mathieu had been thirty years ago apr une rof trees in various localities notably at favero lles
the real ltrace of him was lost
along time afterwards he was seen again in auvergne the nin paris where he is said to have been a wheelwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress but that has not been proved
now before going to the galleys for the ftw hat was jean valjean
apr une rof trees
where
at favero lles
another fact
this valjean 's christian name was jean and his mother 's surname was mathieu
what more natural to suppose than that one merging from the galleys he should have taken his mother 's name for the purpose of concealing himself and have called himself jean mathieu
he goes to auvergne
the local pronunciation turns jean into chan he is called chan mathieu
our man offers no opposition and behold him transformed into champ mathieu
you follow me do you not
inquiries were made at favero lles
the family of jean valjean is nolonger the re
it is not know nw here they have gone
you know that among those classes afam il yof tend is appear s
search was made and nothing was found
when such people are not mud the yared us t
and the nast he beginning of the story dates thirty years back there is nolonger anyone at favero lles who knew jean valjean
inquiries were made at toulon
besides brevet the rear eon lyt woc on vic tsin existence who have seen jean valjean the yare coche pail lean dc he nil die uand are sentenced for life
the yare taken from the galleys and confronted with the pretended champ mathieu
the yd on othe sit at ehe is jean valjean for the mas well as for brevet
the same age he is fifty four the same height the same air the same man in short itis he
it was precisely at this moment that if or ward edm yd enunciation to the prefecture in paris
iwas to ldt hat iha dlo stm yr eason and that jean valjean is a tarras in the power of the authorities
you can imagine whether this surprised me when it hough tth at iha dth at same jean valjean here
i write to the examining judge he sends for me champ mathieu is conducted to me well
interposed m
madeleine
javert replied his face incorruptible and as melancholy as ever mr
mayor the truth is the truth
iams or ry but that man is jean valjean
irec ognized him also
m
madeleine resume dina very low voice you are sure
javert began to laugh with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction
o
sure
he stood there thoughtfully for a moment mechanical lyta kingpin ches of powdered wood for blotting in kf rom the wooden bowl which stood on the table and head de dan de ven now that ihave seen the real jean valjean id on ots ee how i could have thought otherwise
i beg your pardon mr
mayor
javert as headdress edt he segrave and suppl icat in gwo rds to the man who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station house and bad ehi mle ave the room javert that haughty man was unconscious lyf ull of simplicity and dignity m
madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question and what does this man say
ah
indeed mr
mayor it'sa bad business
if he is jean valjean he has his previous conviction against him
to climb a wall to break abra nch to purl oin apple sis amis chievo us trick in a child for a man it is a misdemeanor for a convict it is a crime
robbing and housebreaking it is all the re
it is nolonger aquest ion of correctional police itis am at ter for the court of assizes
it is nolonger am at tero faf ewd a ysi npr is on it is the galleys for life
and the nth ere is the affair with the little savoyard who will return ihop e
the deuce
the reis plenty to dispute in the matter is the reno t
yes for anyone but jean valjean
but jean valjean is a sly dog
that is the way i recognized him
anyother man would have felt that things were getting hot for him he would struggle he would cry out the kettle sings before the fire he would not be jean valjean etcetera
but he has not the appearance of understanding he says ' iam champ mathieu and iwon ' tde part from that
' he has an astonished air hep rete nds to be stupid it is far better
oh
the rogue is clever
but it makes no difference
the proof sare the re
he has been recognized by four persons the old scamp will be condemned
the case has been taken to the assizes at a rras
is hall got here to give my testimony
ihave been summoned
m
madeleine had turned to his desk again and take nup his docket and was turning over the leaves tranquil lyre ading and writing by turn slike abus yma n
he turned to javert that will do javert
in truth all the sede tails interest me but little
we are wasting our time and we have pressing business on hand
javert you will be take your self at once to the house of the woman bus eau pied whose lls herbs at the corner of the rue saint saul ve
you will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre ches nel on g
the man is a brute who came near crushing this woman and her child
he must be punished
you will then goto m
char cell ayr uem on tred echam pig ny
he complained that the reis agutter on the adjoining house which discharges rainwater on his premises and is undermining the foundation so fhi shouse
after that you will verify the infraction so fpo lice regulations which have been reported to me in the rue gui bourg at widow doris 's and rue du garra udb lan cat madame renee lebo sse 's and you will prepare documents
but i am giving you agreat deal of work
are you not to be absent
did you not tell me that you were going to arras on that matter in a week or tend a ys
sooner than that mr
mayor
on what day the n
why it hough tth at iha dsa id to monsieur le maire that the case was to be tried to morrow and that i am to set out by diligence to night
m
madeleine made an imperceptible movement
and how long will the case last
one day at the most
the judgment will be pronounced tomorrow evening at latest
but is hall not wait for the sentence which is certain is hall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken
that is well said m
madeleine
and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand
javert did not withdraw
excuse me mr
mayor said he
what is it now
demanded m
madeleine
mr
mayor the reiss till something of which i must remind you
what is it
that i must be dismissed
m
madeleine rose
javert you are amano fh on or an dies tee my ou
you exaggerate your fault
moreover this is an offence which concerns me
javert you deserve promotion instead of degradation
i wish you to retain your post
javert gazed at m
madeleine with his candid eyes in whose depth shi snot very enlightened but pure and rigid conscience seemed visible and said in a tranquil voice mr
mayor icann otg rant you that
ire peat replied m
madeleine that the matter concerns me
but javert heeding his own thought only continue dso far as exaggeration is concerned iam not exaggerating
this is the way i reason i have suspected you unjustly
that is not hing
it is our right to cherish suspicion although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse
but without proof sin afit of rage with the object of wreaking my vengeance ihave denounced you as a convict you are spec table manama yoram agis trate
that is serious very serious
ihave insulted authority in your person iana gent of the authorities
if one of my subordinate shad done what i have done is hould have declared him unworthy of the service and have expelled him
well
stop mr
mayor one word more
ihave often been severe in the course of my life towards others
that is just
ihave done well
now if i were not severe towards myself all the justice that ihave done would be come injustice
ought it ospar em ys elf more than others
no
what
is hould be good for nothing but to chastise other sand not myself
why is hould be a black guard
those who say ' that blackguard of a javert
' would be in the right
mr
mayor id on otd esire that you should treat me kindly your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to other s
iwan tno neo fit for myself
the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen the police agent against the mayor the man who is down against the man who is up in the world is what i call false kindness
that is the sort of kindness which disor gani zes society
good god
it is very easy to be kind the difficulty lies in being just
come
if you had been what it hough tyo uis hould not have been kind to you not i
you would have seen
mr
mayor imus ttr eat myself as iwould treat any other man
when i have subdued malefactors when i have proceeded with vigor against rascals ihave often said to myself ' if you flinch if i ever catch you in faulty ouma yr esta tyo urease
' ihave flinched ihave caught myself in a fault
so much the worse
come discharge dcas hier ed expelled
that is well
ihave arms
iwill till the soil it makes no difference to me
mr
mayor the good ofthese rvice demands an example
is imply require the discharge of inspector javert
all this was uttered in a proud humble despairing yet convinced to new hich lent indescribable grandeur to this singular honest man
we shall see said m
madeleine
and he offered him his hand
javert recoiled and said in a wild voice excuse me mr
mayor but this must not be
ama yor does not offer his hand to apo lice spy
head de dbe tween his teeth apo lice spy yes from the moment when i have misused the police
iam no more than a police spy
the nhe bowed profoundly and directed his steps towards the door
the re he wheeled round and with eyes still down cast mr
mayor he said is hall continue to serve until i am superseded
he withdrew
m
madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm sure step which died away on the pavement of the corridor
books event h
the champ mathieu affair chapter is ister simpli cet he incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known at m
sur m
but the small portion of the mwh ich became known left such a memory in that town that as eri ous gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate the mint heir most minute details
among the sede tails the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances which we preserve out of respect for the truth
onthe afternoon following the visit of javert m
madeleine went to see fantin eac cording to his wont
before entering fantin e 's room he had sisters impli ces umm one d
the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary lazar is tel adie slike all sisters of charity bore the names of sister per pet uea nds is ters impli ce
sister per pet ue was an ordinary village ras is tero fch arity in a coarse style who had entered the service of god as one enters an yot her service
she was an una so the rwo men are cooks
this type is not so very rare
the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline
the ser us ticsa re utilized for the rough work of devotion
the transition from a drove rto acar me lite is not in the least violent the one turns into the other without much effort the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand and places the boor at once on the same footing as the monk alittle more amplitude in the smock and it becomes a frock
sister per pet ue was a robust nun from marine sne arp onto is ewh ocha tter edhe rpa to isdr one dgr umb leds uga red the potion according to the bigotry or the hypocrisy of the invalid treated her patients abruptly roughly was crabbed with the dying almost flung godin the irfa cess to ned the ird eat hago ny with prayers mumbled in a rage was bold honest and ruddy
sisters impli ce was white with a waxen pallor
besides is ter per pet ues he was the tape rbe side the candle
vincent depaul has divinely traced the features of the sister of charity in the sea dmi rable words in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude the ys hall have for the irc on vento nly the house of the sick for cello nly ahir ed room for chapel only the irpa rish church for cloister only the streets of the town and the war dso fthe hospitals for enclosure only obedience for gratings only the fear of god for veil only modest y
this idea lwa sre alized in the living person of sisters impli ces he had never been young and its eem edas though she would never grow old
noone could have to lds is ters impli ce 's age
she was a person wed are not say a woman who was gentle austere well bred cold and who had never lied
she was so gentle that she appeared fragile but she was more solid than granite
she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charming ly pure and fine
the rewa sso to speak silence in her speech she said just what was necessary and she possessed a tone of voice which would have equally edified acon fessional or enchanted adra wing room
this delicacy accommodate dits elf to the serge gown finding in this harsh contact acon tin ualr emin der of heaven and of god
let us emphasize one detail
never to have lied never to have said for any interest whatever even in indifference any single thing which was not the truth the sacred truth was sisters impli ce 's distinctive trait it was the accent of her virtue
she was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity
the abbe sicard speaks of sisters impli cei nale tter to the deaf mute mass ie u
however pure and sincere we may be weal lbe arup on our can do rthe crack of the little innocent lie
she did not
little lie in no cent lied oes such a thing exist
to lie is the absolute for mof evil
to lie alittle is not possible he who lies lies the whole lie
to lie is the very face of the demon
satan has two names heis called satan and lying
that is what she thought and as she thought so she did
the result was the white ness which we have mentioned a white ness which covered even her lips and here yes with radiance
her smile was white her glance was white
the rewa snot asin gles pid er 's web not agra in of dust on the glass window of that conscience
one nter in gthe order of saint vincent depaul she had taken the name of simpli ceb ysp eci alch oic e
simpli ceo fsi cil yas we know is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse ali ewh ich would have saved her
this patrons ain t suite dth is so ul
sisters impli ceo nh erent rance into the order had had two faults which she had gradually corrected she had a taste for dainties and she liked to receive letters
she never read anything but abook of prayer sprint edin latin in coarse type
she did not understand latin but she understood the book

he urged everyone repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything
it was not iced that the rewa sam omen twh en his countenance became very sombre
but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him she is losing ground fast

he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it then he paused again and stopped short as though in thought and after the lapse of a few seconds instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly he placed it gently and resume dhis way with a sort of haste which had not been apparent previously

yes
does monsieur le maire know how to drive
yes
well monsieur le maire will travel alone and without baggage in order not to overload the horse

but as monsieur le maire will have no one with him he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen
that is understood

monsieur le maire must consent to travel in alittle tilbury that i own

it is light but it has no cover
that makes no difference to me

madeleine preserved silence

he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation but he did not know why he had not dare dto put the question

don otf or get to be at my door at precisely half past four o'clock tomorrow morning replied m
madeleine and he took his departure
the fleming remained utterly stupid as he himself said sometime after wards
the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again it was the mayor once more
he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air
monsieur sca uff lair esa id heat what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let tome the one bearing the other

so be it

no but i wish to guarantee you in any case
you shall give me back the sum at my return
at what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet

besides the horse and tilbury together were worth but a hundred crown s
the fleming called his wife and related the affair to her
where the devil could monsieur le maire be going
the yhe ldc oun sel together
he is going to paris said the wife
id on ' tbe lieve its aid the husband
m
madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it and it lay on the chimney piece
the fleming picked it up and studied it

that must designate the posting relays
he turned to his wife ihave found out
what
it is five league sfr omh ere to hes din six from hes dint osa in tpo leigh tanda half from saint pol to arras
he is going to arras
meanwhile m
madeleine had returned home
he had taken the longest way to return from masters ca uff lair e 's as though the parsonage door had been at empt ation for him and he had wished to avoid it
he ascended to his room and the re he shut himself up which was avery simple acts in ceh eli ked to go to be dearly
nevertheless the port res soft he factory who was a tthe sametime m
madeleine 's only servant notice dth at the latter 's light was extinguished at half past eight and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home adding is monsieur le maire ill
it hough the hadar at her singular air
this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m
madeleine 's chamber
he paid no heed to the port res s 's words but we ntt obed and to sleep
towards midnight he woke up with a start in his sleep he had heard an oise above his head
he listened it was afoot step pacing back and forth as though someone were walking in the room above him
he listened more attentive lya ndr eco gni zed m
madeleine 's step
this struck him as strange usually the rewa sno noise in m
madeleine 's chamber until he rose in the morning
amo men tla tert he cashier heard an oise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened and the nsh uta gain the nap iec eof furniture was dis arranged the napa use ensued the nth este pbe gana gain
the cashier sat up in bed quite a wake now and staring and through his window panes he saw the reddish gleam of alighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direction of the rays it could only come from the window of m
madeleine 's chamber
the reflection wavered as though it camera the rf roma fire which had been lighted than from a candle
the shadow of the window frame was not shown which indicated that the window was wide open
the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising
the cashier fellas lee paga in
an hour or two later he waked again
the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth over head
the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or of a candle
the window was still open
this is what had taken place in m
madeleine 's room
chapter iii at emp est in a skull the reader has no doubt already divine dth at m
madeleine is no other than jean valjean
wehave already gazed into the depths of this conscience the moment has now come when we must take another look into it
we do so not without emotion and trepidation
the reis nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation
the eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than in man it can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable more complicated more mysterious and more infinite
the reis aspect acle more grand than the sea itis heaven there is aspect acle more grand than heaven it is the inmost recesses of the soul
to make the poem of the human conscience were it only with reference to asin gle man were it only in connection with the base sto fme nwo uld be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic
conscience is the chaos of chimeras of lust sand of temptation sthe furnace of dreams the lair of ideas of which we are ashamed it is the pandemonium of soph is msi tis the battlefield of the passion s

what a solemn thing is this infinity whichever yma nbe ars within him and which he measures with despair against the caprice so fhi sbr aina ndt he actions of his life
alighieri one day met with a sinister looking door before which he hesitated
here is one before us upon whose threshold we hesitate
let us enter nevertheless
wehave but little to add to what the reader already know so fw hatha dha ppe ned to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais
from that moment for thhe was a swe have seen at otal lyd if ferent man
what the bishop had wished to make of him that he carried out
it was more than a transformation it was a transfiguration
he succeeded in disappearing sold the bishop 's silver reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir crept from town to town traverse dfr an cecam et om

sometimes however the yc on flict ed
in that case as the reader will remember the man who mall the country of m
sur m
called m
madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second his security to his virtue
thus inspite of all his reserve and all his prudence he had preserved the bishop 's candlestick sworn mourning for him summoned and interrogated all the little savoyard sw hop assed that way collected information regarding the families at favero lles and save do ldf auch eleven t 's life despite the disquieting insinuations of javert
it seemed as we have already remarked as though he thought following the example of all those who have been wise holy and just that his first duty was not towards himself
atthe sametime it must be confessed nothing just like this had yet presented itself
never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man who ses uffe rings wear en arra tinge ngage din so serious as tru ggl e
he understood this confused ly but profound lya tthe very first words pronounced by javert when the latter entered his study
atthe moment when that name which he had buried beneath soma nyla yers was so strangely articulated he was struck with stupor and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny and through this stupor he felt that shudder which precedes great shock s
he bent like an oak at the approach of astor mli kea soldier at the approach of an assault
he felt shadows filled with thunder sand lightning sdesc ending upon his head
as he listened to javert the first thought which occurred to him was to go to run and denounce himself to take that champ mathieu out of prison and place himself there this was a spain fula ndas poignant as an incision in the living flesh
the nit passed away and he said to himself we will see
wewill see

we must render an account of the things which went on inthis soul and we can only tell what the rewa sthe re
he was carried away at first bythe instinct of self preservation her allied all his ideas in haste stifled his emotions to okin to consider a tion javert 's presence that great danger postponed all decision with the firmness of terror shook off thought as to what he had to do and resume dhis calmness as a warrior picks up his buckle r
here maine dint his state during the rest of the day awhirl wind within a profound tranquillity without
he took no preservative measures as the yma ybe called
everything was still confused and jostling together in his brain
his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of asin gle idea distinctly and he could have to ldn othing about himself except that he had received a great blow
here paired to fantin e 's bed of suffering as usual and prolonged his visit through a kind lyin sti nc tte lling himself that he must be have thus andre commend her well to the sisters in case he should be obliged to be absent himself
he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to arras and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being a she was beyond the shadow of any suspicion the reco uld be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged the tilbury from sca uff lair ein order to be prepared in any event
he dined with a good deal of appetite
on returning to his room he commune dwi th himself
he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented that in the midst of his rever yhe rose from his chair moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door
he feared lest something more should enter
he was bar rica ding himself against possibilities
amo men tla ter he extinguished his light item barras sed him
it seemed to him as though he might be seen
by whom
alas
that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his conscience
his conscience that is to say god
nevertheless he deluded himself at first he had a feeling of security and of solitude the bolton cedr a wn he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible
the nhe to ok possession of himself he set his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate in the dark
where do is tand
am not id reaming
what have ihe ard
is it really true that ihave seen that javert and that he spoke to me in that manner
who can thatcham pm at hieu be
so here semble sme
is it possible
when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and sofa rfr oms us pectin gan y thing
what was id oing yesterday at this hour
what is the rein this incident
what will the end be
what is to be done
this was the torment in which he found himself
his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest the m
nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution
his head was burning
he went to the window and threw it wide open
the re were no stars in the sky
here turned and seated himself at the table
the first hour passed in this manner
gradually however vague outlines began to take for man dto fix the mse lve sinh is meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality not the whole situation but some of the details
he began by recognizing the fact that critical and extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it
this only caused an increase of his stupor
independent lyo fthe severe and religious aim which he had assigned to his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name
that which he had always feared most of all in his hours of self communion during his sleepless nights was to ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would be the end of all things for him that onthe day when that name made it sre appearance it would cause his new life to vanish from about him and who knows
perhaps even his new soul within him also
he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible
assuredly if anyone had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had envelope dhi msel fw ould suddenly blaze for thabo vehi she ada ndt hat that name would not menace him that that light would but produce a nobs curity more dense that this rent veil would but increase the mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this prodigious incident would have no other results of arash ewa sconce rne dif so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would emerge more honored more peaceful and more respected than ever if anyone had to ldh imt hath ewo uld have to ssed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman
well all this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of impossibilities was a fact and god had permitted the sew il dfa nci est obe come real thing s
his rever yc ontinued to grow clearer
he came more and more to an understanding of his position
it seemed to him that he had but just wake dup from some inexplicable dream and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very brink of the abyss
he distinctly perceived in the darkness as trang era man unknown to him who md est in yha dmis taken for him and who ms he was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close once more itwas necessary that someone himself or that other man should fall into it heh adon lyle tth in gst a ket heir course
the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that his place was empty in the galleys that do what he would it was still awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled it that this was inevitable and fatal and the nhes aid to himself that at this moment he had a substitute that it appeared that acer tain champ mathieu had that i lll uck and that as regards himself being present in the galleys in the person of that champ mathieu present in society under the name of m
madeleine he had nothing more to fear provided that he did not prevent me nfr oms ealing over the head of that champ mathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the sepulchre falls on cen ever to rise again
all this was so strange and so violent that the res ud den lyt ook place in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life as orto fcon vul sion of the conscience which stirs up all that the reis doubtful in the heart which is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter
he has til yr elig hte dhis candle
well what the n
he said to himself what am i afraid of
what is the reina llt hat for me to think about
iams a feal lis over
i had but one part lyo pen door through which my past might invade my life and behold that door is walled up for ever
that javert who has been annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divine dme which had divine dme good god
and which followed me everywhere that frightful hunting dog always making a point at me is thrown off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail henceforth heiss at is fied he will leave me in peace he has his jean valjean
who knows
it is even probable that he will wish to leave town
and all this has been brought about without any aid from mean dicount for nothing in it
ah
but where is the misfortune in this
upon my honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened to me
after all if it does bring harm to someone that is not my fault in the least it is providence which has done it all it is because it wishes its oto be evident ly
have it her ight to disa rra nge what it has arranged
what do i ask now
why should i meddle
it does not concern me what
iam not satisfied but what more doi want
the goal to which ihave aspire dfor soma ny years the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to heaven security ihave now attained it is god who will sit ican donot hing against the will of god and why does god will it
inorder that i may continue what i have begun that i may dog ood that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that it may be said atlas tth at alittle happiness has been attached to the penance which ihave undergone a ndt otha tv irt uet ow hich ihave returned
really id on otu nder stand why i was afraid alittle while ago to enter the house of that good cure and to ask his advice this is evident ly what he would have said to me it is settled let things take the irc our sele tthe good god do as he likes
thus did headdress himself in the depths of his own conscience bending over what maybe called his own abyss her ose from his chair and began to pace the room comes aid he let us think no more about it myres olv eis taken
but he felt no joy
quite the reverse
one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can these afro mret urn in gto the shore the sailor calls it the tide the guilty man calls it remorse god up heaves the soul as he does the ocean
after the expiration of a few moments do what he would here sumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him think
as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago march on
before proceeding further and inorder to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation
it is certain that people do talk to the mse lve sthe reis no living being who has not done it
it may even be said that the word is never amore magnificent mystery than when it goes from though tto conscience with in amana nd when it returns from conscience to thought it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chapter hesa id he exclaimed must be understood one speaks to one 's self talks to one 's self exclaims to one 's self without breaking the external silence the reis agreat tumult everything about us talks except the mouth
the realities of the soul are nonetheless realities because they are not visible and palpable
so he asked himself where he stood
he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve
he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take the irc our set ole tthe good god do as he liked was simply horrible to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it to lend him self to it through his silence to do not hing in short was to doeverything
that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree
that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime
for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just taste dthe bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action
he spit it out with disgust
he continued to question himself
he asked himself severely what he had meant by this myobject is attained
he declared to himself that his life really had an object but what object
to conceal his name
to deceive the police
was it for so petty at hing that he had done all that he had done
had he not another and agra nd object which was the true one to save not his person but his soul to become honest and good once more to be a just man
was it not that above all that alone which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon him to shut the door on his past
but he was not shutting it
great god
he was reopening it by committing an infamous action
he was becoming a thief once more and the most odious of thieves
he was robbing another of his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine
he was becoming a nass as sin
he was murdering morally murdering a wretched man
he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death beneath the open sky which is called the galleys
onthe other hand to surrender himself to save that man struck down with some lan chol yan error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that he llw hence he had just emerged to fallback the reina ppe aran ce was to escape from it in reality
this must be done
he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penitence was wasted
the rewa sno longer any need of saying what is the use
he felt that the bishop was the retha tthe bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop was gazing fixed lya thi mth at henceforth mayor madeleine with all his virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishops a whi sfac eth at mens a whi sli feb utt hat the bishop beheld his conscience
so he must go to arras deliver the false jean valjean and denounce the real one
alas
that was the greatest of sacrifice sthe most poignant of victories the last step to take but it must be done
sad fate
he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men
well said he let us decide upon this let us do our duty let us save this man
he uttered the sew or dsa loud without perceiving that he was speaking aloud
he took his books verified the man dput the minor der
he flung in the fire abund leo fbi lls which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen
he wrote and sealed ale tter and onthe envelope it might have been read had the rebe enan yon ein his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitte banker rue d' artois paris
he drew from his secretary apoc ket book which contained several banknotes and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the election s
anyone who had seen him during the execution of the seva rious acts in to which the reentered such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was going on with in him
only occasionally did his lips move at other times her aise dhis head and fixed his gaze upon some point of the wall as though the re existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate
when he had finished the letter to m
laffitte he put it into his pocket together with the pocketbook and began his walk on cem or e
his rever yha dno tsw erv edf rom its course
he continued to see his duty clearly written in luminous letters which flame dbe for ehi se yes and change dits place as he altered the direction of his glance go
tell you rna me
denounce yourself
in the same way he beheld a sth ought hey had passed before him invisible for mst he two ideas which had upto that time for me dthe double rule of his soul the concealment of his name the sanctification of his life
for the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct and he perceived the distance which separated the m
here cogni zed the fact that one of the seide as was necessarily good while the other might be come bad that the first was self devotion and that the other was personality that the ones aid my neighbor and that the other said myself that one emanated from the light and the other from darkness
the yw ere antagonistic
he saw the minco nfl ict
in proportion as he meditated the yg re wbe for ethe eyes of his spirit
the yha dno watt aine dc olo ssa lstat ures and its eem edt ohim that he beheld within himself in that infinity of which we were recently speaking in the midst of the darkness and the light sago dde ssa nda giant contending
he was filled with terror but it seemed to him that the good though twas getting the upper hand
he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that champ mathieu marked the second
after the grand crisis the grand test
but the fever all aye dfor an instant gradually resume dpo sses sion of him
at hous and thought stra verse dhis mind but the yc ontinued to fortify him in his resolution
one moment he said to himself that he was perhaps taking the matter to oke en lyth at afterall this champ mathieu was not interesting and that he had actually been guilty of the ft
he answered himself if this man has indeed stolen afew apple sth at means a month in prison
it is along way from that tothe galleys
and who knows
did he steal
has it been proved
the name of jean valjean overwhelms him and seems to dispense with proof s
don ott heat to rne ys for the crown always proceed in this manner
he is supposed to be at hie fbe cause he is known to be a convict
in another instant the thought had occurred to him that when he denounced him self the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into consideration and his honest life for the last seven years and what he had done for the district and that the yw ould have mercy on him
but this supposition vanished very quickly and he smiled bitterly asher eme mber edt hat the theft of the forty sous from little gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction that this affair would certainly come up and according to the precise terms of the law would render him liable to penal servitude for life
he turned aside from all illusions detached himself more and more from earth and sought strength and consolation elsewhere
he told him self that he must do his duty that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having a voided it that if he allowed things to take the irow nco urs eif here maine dat m

at length he told him self that it must be so that his destiny was thus allotted that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made on high that in any case he must make his choice virtue without an dabo mination within or holiness within and infamy without
the stirring up of the sel ugu brio us ideas didnot cause his courage to fail but his brain grow weary
he began to think of other things of indifferent matters in spite of himself
the veins in his temples throbbed violently he still paced to and from idn ights ound edf irst from the parish church then from the townhall he counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks and compare dthe sounds of the two bells here called in this connection the fact that a few days previously he had seen in an ironmonger 's shop an ancient clock for sale upon which was written the name antoine albin der oma in ville
he was cold heli ght edas mall fire it did not occur to him to close the window
in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupor he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck he finally succeeded in doing this
ah

after putting this question to himself he paused he seemed to undergo a moment ary hesitation and trepidation but it did not last long and he answered himself calmly well this man is going to the galleys it is true but what the deuce

because it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous this is melodrama after all because i should have thought of noone but myself the idea
for the sake of saving from a punishment at rifle exaggerated perhaps but just a tbo tto mno one knows who math ie fago odf or nothing evidently a whole country side must perish

and without the mother even having seen her child once more almost without the child 's having known her mother and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple thief who most assuredly has deserved the galleys for something else if not for that fines cru ples indeed which save a guilty man and sacrifice the innocent which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his hovel and which sacrifice a whole population mother swi ves children

iam nolonger he id on otk now that man in olo nger know anything it turns out that someone is jean valjean at the present moment let him look out for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal name which was floating abroad in the night if it halts and descends on ahead so much the worse for that he ad
he looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney piece and said hold
it has relieved me to come to a decision iam quite another man now
he proceeded afew pace sfu rthe rthe nhes topped short

he said imus tno tfl in chb efore any of the consequences of the resolution which ihave once adopted the rear estill thread sw hich attach met otha tje an valjean the ym us tbe broken in this very room there are objects which would be tray med umb things which would be a rw it ness against me it is settled all the set hing smu std is appear
he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out as mall key heins erte dthe key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre to nes of the design which covered the wallpaper as ecre trece ptac leo pened as orto ffa lse cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney piece in this hiding place the re were some rags a blueline nbl ouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn cudgels hod with iron at both ends
those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through dino ctober could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit
he had preserved the mash ehad preserved the silver candlesticks inorder to remind himself continually of his starting point but he had concealed all that came from the galleys and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen
he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened it then with a quick and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without bestowing so much as a glance onthe things which he had sorel igi ously and so perilously preserved for soma ny years and flung the mall rags cudgel knapsack into the fire
illustration candlesticks into the fire bin to the fire he closed the false cupboard again and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary since it was now empty he concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it
after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow
everything was on fire the thorn cudgels napped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber
as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous rags which it contained it revealed something which sparkle dint he ashes
by bending over one could have read il yr eco gni zed a coin no doubt the forty soup iec est olen from the little savoyard
he did not look at the fire but paced back and forthwith the same step
all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone vaguely on the chimney piece through the glow
hold
he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in the m
the ym us tbe destroyed also
he seized the two candlesticks
the rewa sst ill fire enough to allow oftheir being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal
he bent over the heart hand warmed himself for a moment
he felt as ense of real comfort
how good warmth is
said he
he stirred the live coal swith one of the candlesticks
amin ute more and the yw ere both in the fire
at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting jean valjean
jean valjean
his hair rose upright he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing
yes that 's it
finish
said the voice
complete what you are about
destroy the sec and lest i cks
annihilate this souvenir
forget the bishop
forget everything
destroy this champ mathieu do
that is right
applaud your self
so it is settled resolved fixed agreed here is an old man who does not know what is wanted of him who has perhaps done nothing an innocent man who sew hole misfortune lies in your name upon whom you rna me weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who will be condemned who will finish his days in abject ness and horror
that is good
bean honest man yourself remain monsieur le maire remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent rear the orphan live happy virtuous and admired and during this time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a man who will wear your red blouse who will be a ryou rna mein ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys
yes it is well arranged thus
ah wretch
the perspiration stream edf rom his brow
he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks
but that within him which had spoken had not finished
the voice continued jean valjean the re will be around you many voices which will make a great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and only one which noone will hear and which will curse you in the dark
well
listen infamous man
all those benediction swill fallback before the yr each heaven and only the male diction will ascend to go d
this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most obscure depth so fhi scons cience had gradually become startling and formidable and he now heard it in his very ear
it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking out side of him
he thought that he heard the last words so distinct lyth at he glanced around the room in a sort of terror
isthe re anyone here
hedeman de da loud in utter bewilderment
the nhe resume dwi thal aug hwh ich resembled that of an idiot how stupid iam
the rec an ben oon e
the rewa sso me one but the person who was the rewa soft hose who mthe human eye can not see
he placed the candlesticks on the chimney piece
the nhe resume dhis monotonous and lugubrious tramp which trouble dthe dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and awoke him with a start
this tramping to and fro soothed and atthe sametime intoxicated him
it sometimes seems on supreme occasions as though people moved about forth epu rpo seo fas king advice of everything that the yma yenc ount erb ych an geo fpl ace
after the lapse of a few minutes he nolonger knew his position
he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolution sat which he had arrived in turn
the two ideas which counsel led him appeared to him equally fatal
what a fatality
what conjunction that that champ mathieu should have been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which provide nces eem edt oh ave employed at first to strengthen his position
the rewa sam omen twh en here flected on the future
denounce himself great god
deliver himself up
with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave a llt hath esh ould be obliged to take up on cem or e
he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good so pure so radiant to the respect of all tohono rto liberty
he should never more stroll in the field she should never more heart he birds sing in the month of may he should never more bestowal mso nthe little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having glance so fgr at it ude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house which he had built that little chamber
everything seemed charming to him at that moment
never again should here adt hose books nevermore should he write on that little table of white wood his old port res sthe only servant who mhe kept would never more bring him his coffee in the morning
great god
instead of that the convict gang their on necklet the red waistcoat the chain on his ankle fatigue the cell the camp be dall those horror sw hich he knew sowell

and at night dripping with perspiration overwhelmed with lassitude the irg re encap sdr a wno vert heir eyes to remount two by two theladders tair case of the galleys beneath the sergeant 's whip
oh what misery

and do what he would heal ways fell back upon the heart rending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his rever ys hould here main in paradise and become a demon
should here turn to hell and become an angel
what was to be done
great god
what was to be done
the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was unchained afresh within him
his ideas began to grow confused on cem or ethe yass umeda kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair
the name of romain ville recurred in cess an tly to his mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past
he thought that romain ville was alittle grove near paris where you ngl over sgot opl uck lilacs in the month of april
he wavered outwardly aswell as inwardly
he walked like alittle child who is permitted to toddle alone
at intervals as he combat ed his lassitude he made an effort to recover the master yof his mind
he tried to put to himself for the last time and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen prostrate with fatigue ought he to denounce himself
ought he to hold his peace
he could not manage to see anything distinctly
the vague aspects of all the course so freas on in gwh ich had been sketched out by his meditation squ iver edan dva nished one after the other into smoke
he only felt that to whatever course of action hema de up his mind something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as onthe left that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness or the agony of his virtue
alas
all his resolution had again taken possession of him
he was no further advanced than a tthe beginning
thus did this unhappy souls tru ggl ein its anguish
eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sancti ties and all the suffering so fhu man it yha dal solo ngt hr us tas ide with his hand while the olive trees quivered in the wild wind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with stars
chapter iv forms assumed by suffering during sleep three o'clock in the morning had just struck and he had been walking thus for five hours almost uninterrupted ly when he at length allowed himself to drop in to his chair
the re he fell asleep and had a dream
this dreamlike the majority of dreams bore no relation to the situation except by its painful and heartrending character but it made an impression on him
this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on
it is one of the paper sinh is own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us
we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text
of whatever nature this dream maybe the history of this night would be incomplete if we were too mit it itis the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul
here it is
onthe envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i had that night
iwas in a plain avast gloomy plain where the rewa snog rass
it did not seem to me to be daylight nor yet night
iwas walking with my brother the brother of my child is hye ars the brother of whom i must say in ever think and who minow hardly remember
we were conversing and we met some passersby
we were talking of an eigh boro four sin former days who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street
as we talked we felt cold because of that open window
the re were not rees in the plain
we saw a man passing close to us
he was entirely nude ofthe hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was earth color
the man had no hair we could see his skull and the veins on it
in his hand hehe ldas witch which was a ssu pple as a vines hoot and as heavy as iron
this horseman passed and said nothing to us
my brother said to me ' let us take to the hollow road
' the re existed a hollow way where in one saw neither as in gles hr ub nora spear of moss
everything was dirt colored event he sky
after proceeding afew pace sire ceived noreply when i spoke ip erc eiv edt hat my brother was nolonger with me

all the streets were deserted all the doors were open
not as in gle living being was passing in the streets walking through the chamber so rstr olli ngi nthe garden s
but behind each angle of the walls behind each door behind each tree stood as i lent man
only one was to be seen at a time
the semen watched me pass
ile ftth etown and began to ramble about the field s
after the lapse of sometime it urn ed back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me
irec ognized all the men who miha dse en int hat to wn

the ydi dno tse emt obe in a hurry yet they walked faster than i did

do you not know that you have been dead this longtime
' iop ened my mouth to reply and i perceived that the rewa sno one near me
he woke
he was icy cold
awi nd which was chill like the breeze of dawn was rattling the leaves of the window which had been left open on the ir hinges
the fire was out
the candle was nearing its end
it was still blacknight
her ose he went to the window
the re were no stars in the sky even yet
from his window they ardo fthe house and the street were visible
as harp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the earth
below him he perceived two redstar sw hose rays lengthened and shortened in asin gular manner through the darkness
as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold
said he there are no stars in the sky
the yare one art hno w
but this confusion vanished as econ dsound similar to the first roused him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that the set wos tar swer ethel an terns of a carriage
by the light which the yca sthe was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle
it was a tilbury harnessed to asmal lw hit eho rse
the noise which he had heard was the trampling of the horse 's hoof son the pavement
what vehicle is this
he said to himself
whois coming here so early in the morning
at that moment there came alight tap on the door of his chamber
he shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice whois the re
someone said imo nsi eur lemaire
here cogni zed the voice of the old woman who was his port res s
well
here plied what is it
monsieur le maire it is just five o'clock in the morning
what is that tome

the coachman says that he has come for monsieur le maire
what coachman

sca uff lair e
that name sent as hud der over him as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face
ah
yes here sumed m
sca uff lair e
if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been frightened
at ole rab ly long silence ensued
he examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air and from around the wick he took some of the burning wax which he rolled between his fingers
the old woman waited for him
she even venture dto uplift her voice once more what am i to say monsieur le maire
say that it is well and that i am coming down
chapter vhi ndr ances the postings ervice from a rras to m

was still operate dat this period by small mail wagons of the time of the empire
the sema il wagons were two wheeled cabriolet sup holster edin side with fawn colored leather hung on spring sand having butt wos eats one for the post boy the other forth etra vell er
the wheels were armed with those long offensive axles which keep other vehicles at a distance and which may still be seen on the road in germany
the despatch box an immense oblong coffer was placed behind the vehicle and formed apart of it
this coffer was painted black and the cabriolet yellow

but the yt ravel led at avery rapid rate
the post wagon which set out from a rras at one o'clock every night after the mail from paris had passed arrived at m

alittle before five o'clock in the morning
that night the wagon which was descending to m
sur m
by the hes din road collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the town with alittle tilbury harnessed to a whitehorse which was going in the opposite direction and inwhich the rewa sbu to nep erson aman envelope dina mantle
the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent shock
the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller paid no heed and pursued his road at full gallop
that man is in a devilish hurry
said the postman
the man thus hastening on was the one who mwe have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity
whither was he going
he could not have to ld
why was he has ten in g
he did not know
he was driving at random straight ahead
whither
to arras no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere aswell
at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered
he plunged into the night as in to a gulf
something urged him forward something drew him on
noone could have to ldw hat was taking place within him everyone will understand it
what man is the re who has not entered atleast once in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown
however he had resolved on nothing decided not hing for me dno plan done nothing
none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive
he was more than ever ashe had been at the first moment
why was he going to arras
here peated what he had already said to himself when he had hired sca uff lair e 's cabriolet that whatever the result was to be the rewa snore as on why he should not see with his own eyes and judge of matters for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what to ok place that node cision could be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized that one made mountain souto fever yth in gfr oma distance that at any rate when he should have seen that champ mathieu some wretch his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the galleys in his stead that javert would indeed be the rea ndt hat brevet that chen il die uth at coche pail leo ldc on vic tsw hoh a dk now nhi mb utt hey certainly would not recognize him bah
what an idea
that javert was a hundred league sfr oms us pectin gthe truth that all conjecture sandal lsu ppos it ions were fixed on champ mathieu and that the reis nothing so headstrong as supposition sand conjecture sth at accordingly the rewa sno danger
that it was no doubt adar km omen tbu tth at hes hould emerge from it that after all hehe ldh is destiny however bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it
he clung to this thought
at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to arras
nevertheless he was going thither
as he meditated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that fine regular and even trot which accomplish est wole ague sand aha lfa nh our
in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something with in him drawback
at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m
sur m
lay far behind him
he watched the horizon grow white he stared at all the chilly figures of a winter 's dawn as the ypa ssed before his eyes but without seeing the m
the morning has its spectre sas well as the evening
he did not see the mbu twit hout his being aware of it and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical the sebl acks il houe tte soft rees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul
each time that he passed on eof those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people there with in who are sleeping
the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road produced agent lemon oto nous noise
the set hing sare charming when one is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad
it was broad daylight when he arrived at hes din
he halted in front of the inn to allow the horse abre at hing spell and to have him given some oats
the horse belonged as sca uff lair ehad said to that small race of the boul on nais which has to om uch head to om uch belly and not enough neck and shoulders but which has abroad chest ala rge cru pper thin fine legs and solid hoofs a home ly but a robust and health yr ace
the excellent beast had travelled five league sin two hours and had not a drop of sweat on his loins
he did not get out of the tilbury
the stable man who brought the oats suddenly be ntd own and examined the left wheel
are you going far in this condition
said the man
here plied with an air of not having roused himself from his rever yw hy
have you come from agreat distance
we nto nthe man
five league s
ah
why do you say ' ah
' the man bent down on cem or ewa ssi lent for a moment with his eyes fixed on the wheel then he rose erect and said because thought his wheel has travelled five league sit certainly will not travel another quarter of a league
he sprang out of the tilbury
what is that you say my friend
is a yth at it is a miracle that you should have travelled five league swith out you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway
just see here
the wheel really had suffered serious damage
the shock administered by the mail wagon had split two spoke sands trained the hubs otha tthe nut nolonger held firm
my friend he said to the stable man is the rea wheelwright here
certainly sir
dome these rvice to go and fetch him
he is only as tep from here
hey
master bourg a ill ard
master bourg a ill ard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold

two wheels make a pair
two wheels can not be put together haphazard
in that case sell me a pair of wheels
not all wheels fit all axles sir
try nevertheless
it is useless sir
ihave nothing to sell but cartwheels
we are but apo or country here
have you aca brio let that you can let me have
the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle
he shrugged his shoulders
you treat the cabriolet sth at people let you sowell
if i had one iwould not let it to you
well sell it to me the n
ihave none
what
note venas pring cart
iam not hard to please as you see
we live in a poor country
the reis in truth added the wheelwright an old calas hunde rthe she dyo nder which belongs to abour geo is ofthe to wnw hoga veit to me to take care of an dwh oon ly use sito nthe thirty six tho fthe month never that is to say
i might let that to you for what matters it to me
but the bourgeois must not see it pass and the niti sac alas hit would require two horses
iwill take two post horses
where is monsieur going
to arras
and monsieur wishes to reach the reto day
yes ofcourse
by taking two post horses
why not
does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at four o'clock tomorrow morning
certainly not
the reis one thing to be said about that you see by taking post horses monsieur has his passport
yes
well by taking post horses monsieur can not reach a rras before tomorrow
we are on across road
the relay sare badly served the horses are in the field s
the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from the post aswell as elsewhere
monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay
and the nth ey drive at a walk
the rear eman yh ills to ascend
come the niw ill go on horseback
unh arness the cabriolet
someone can surely sell me as a ddl ein the neighborhood
without doubt
but will this horse bear the saddle
that is true your emin dme of that he will not be a rit
the nbu tica nsure lyh ire a horse in the village
aho rset otra vel to arras at one stretch
yes
that would require such a horse as does not exist in the sepa rts
you would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you
but you will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a thousand
what am i todo
the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and set out on your journey to morrow
tomorrow will be too late
the deuce
isthe reno tamai lwa go nw hich runs to arras
when will it pass
tonight
both the post spass at night the one going aswell as the one coming
what
it will take you ada yto men dth is wheel

if you set two men to work
if i set ten men to work
what if the spokes were to be tied together with ropes
that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the felly is in a bad state to o
isthe re anyone in this village whole tsou tte am s
no
isthe re another wheelwright
the stable man and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the head
no
he felt an immense joy
it was evident that provide nce was intervening
that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road
he had not yielded to this sort of first summons he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season nor fatigue norby the expense he had nothing with which to reproach himself
if he went no further that was no fault of his
it did not concern him further
it was nolonger his fault
it was not the act of his own conscience but the act of providence
he breathed a gain
he breathed free lya ndt othe full extent of his lungs for the first time since javert 's visit
it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him
it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifest in ghi msel f
he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had nothing to do but retrace his steps quietly
if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the innit would have had no witnesses noone would have heard him things would have rested the rea ndi tis probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrence sw hich the reader is about to peruse but this conversation had taken place in the street
any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd
the rear eal ways people who ask nothing better than to become spectators
while he was questioning the wheelwrights ome people who were passing back and forth halted around the m
after listening for a few minutes a young lad to whom no one had paid any heed detached himself from the group and ran off
atthe moment when the traveller after the inward deliberation which we have just described resolved to retrace his steps this child returned
he was accompanied by an old woman
monsieur said the woman my boy tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet
the ses imple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickled own his limbs
he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him ready to seize him once more
he answered yes my good woman iam in search of a cabriolet which i can hire
and he has ten edt oad dbu tthe reis none in the place
certainly there is said the old woman
where
interpolated the wheelwright
at myhouse replied the old woman
he shuddered
the fatal hand had grasped him again
the old woman really had in her she das or to fba ske tsp ring cart
the wheelwright and the stable man in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping the irc lut ches interfere d
it was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended in side it by leather thongs the rain came into it the wheels were rusted and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury are gular ramshackle old stage wagon the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc
etc
all this was true but this trap this ramshackle old vehicle this thing whatever it was ran on its two wheels and could go to arras
he paid what was asked left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired intending to reclaim it on his return had the whitehorse put to the car tcl imbed into it and resume dthe road which he had been travelling since morning
atthe moment when the car tmo ved of fhe admitted that he had felt a moment previously acer tain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding
he examined this joy with a sort of wrath and found it absurd
why should he feel joy at turning back
after all he was taking this trip of his own free will
noone was forcing him to it
and assured lyn othing would happen except what he should choose
as he left he sdi nh ehe arda voices hout in gto him stop
stop
he halted the car twit hav igor ous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope
it was the old woman 's little boy
monsieur said the latter it was i who got the car tfor you
well
you have not given me anything
he who gave to all sore adil yth ought this demand exorbitant and almost odious
ah
it 's you you scamp
said he you shall have nothing
he whipped up his horse and set of fat full speed
he had lost agreat deal of time at hes din
he wanted to make it good
the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the month of february there had been rain the road sw ere bad
and the nit was nolonger the tilbury
the car twas very heavy and inaddition the re were many ascent s
he took nearly four hours to go from hes dint osa in tpo lfo ur hours for five league s
at saint pol he had the horse unh arness eda tthe first in nh eca met oand led to the stable as he had promised sca uff lair ehe stood beside the manger while the horse was eating he thought of sadan dc on fusing things
the innkeeper 's wife came to the stable
does not monsieur wish to breakfast
come that is true ie ven have a good appetite
he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful faces he led him to the public room where the re were tables covered with waxed cloth
make haste
said he imus tst art again iam in a hurry
abi gfl emis hse rva nt maid place dhis knife and for kina ll has teh elook eda tthe girl with a sensation of comfort
that is what ailed me he thought i had not breakfast ed
his breakfast was served he seized the bread to oka mouthful and the nsl owl yr epl ace dito nthe table and did not touch it again
acar ter was eating at another table hesa id to this man why is the irb read so bitter here
the carter was a german and did not understand him
here turned to the stable and remained near the horse
an hour later he had quitted saint poland was directing his course towards tin que sw hich is only five league sfr omar ras
what did he do during this journey
of what was he thinking
asin the morning he watched the trees the thatched roof sthe tilled fields pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from though t
what is more melancholy and more profound than to see at hous and objects for the first and the last time
to travel is to be born and to die at every instant perhaps in the vaguest region of his mind he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before us the dark and bright intervals are intermingled after a dazzling moment an eclipse we look we hasten west retch out our hands to grasp what is passing each event is a turn in the road and all at once we are old we feel as hock all is black wed is ting uis han obscured oort he gloomy horse of life which has been drawing us halts and we see ave ile dan dunk now npe rso nun harnessing amid the shadows
twilight was falling when the children who were coming out of school beheld this traveller enter tin que si tis true that the day swer estill short hedi dno thal tatti nq ues as he emerged from the village ala borer who was mending the road with stones raised his head and said to him that horse is very much fatigue d
the poor beast was in fact going at a walk
are you going to arras
added the road mender
yes
if you go on a tth at rate you will not arrive very early
he stopped his horse and asked the labor erh owf aris it from here to arras
nearly seven good league s
how is that

ah

imus tbe the re this evening
that is different but got othe in nall the same and get an extra horse the stable boy will guide you through the crossroads
he followed the road mender 's advice retraced his steps and half an hour later he passed the same spot again but this time at full speed with a good horse to aid as table boy who called himself a postilion was seated on the shaft of the car iol e
still he felt that he had lost time
night had fully come
the yt urn edin to the crossroad the way became frightfully bad the car tlu rch edf rom one rutt othe other hesa id to the postilion keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee

yes sir
he cut abra nch from a tree and made a whiff let re eof it
this caused another loss of twenty minutes but the ys et out again at a gallop
the plain was gloomy low hanging black crisp fog scre pto vert he hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke there were whitish gleams in the clouds astron gbr eeze which blew in from the sea produced as ound in all quarters of the horizon as of someone moving furniture everything that could be seen as sumed attitudes of terror
how many things shiver beneath the seva stbr eat hso fthe night
he was stiff with cold he had eaten nothing since the night before he vaguely recall ed his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of dei ght years previously and its eem ed but yesterday
the hours truck from a distant tower he asked the boy what time is it
seven o'clock sir we shall reach a rras at eight wehave but three leagues still to go
at that moment he forth efi rst time indulged in this reflection thinking it odd the while that it had not occurred to him sooner that all this trouble which he was taking was perhaps useless that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should atleast have informed himself of that that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead with out knowing whether he would be of any service or not the nhes ketch edo uts ome calculations in his mind that ordinarily the sitting soft he court of assizes began at nine o'clock in the morning that it could not be along affair that the theft of the apple sw ould be very brief that the re would then remain on lya question of identity four or five deposition sand very little fort he lawyers to say that he should arrive after all was over

he crossed the little river crin chon and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way
aci ti zen was passing along with a lantern
after some hesitation he decided to apply to this man not without having first glance dbe hind and infront of him as though he feared lest some one should hear the question which he was about to put
monsieur said he where is the courthouse ifyou please
you do not belong in town sir
replied the bourgeois who was an old is hma nwe ll follow me

the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer who mhe met
what stage have the yr each eds ir
he asked

finished
this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round
excuse me sir perhaps you are are lative

ofcourse
nothing else was possible

for life
he continued in a voice so we akt hat it was barely audible the nhis identity was established
what identity
replied the lawyer
the rewa sno identity to be established
the matter was very simple
the woman had murdered her child the infanticide was proved the jury threw out the question of premeditation and she was condemned for life
so it was a woman
said he
why certain ly
the limos in woman
of what are you speaking
nothing
but since it is all over how come sit that the hall is still light ed
for another case which was begun about two hours ago
what other case

however the hearing has been suspended
some people have gone out and when the hearing is resumed you might make an effort
where is the entrance
through yonder large door
the lawyer left him
in the course of a few moments he had experienced almost simultaneously almost intermingled with eachother all possible emotions
the words of this indifferent spectator had in turn pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire
when he saw that nothing was settled he breathed free lyon cem or ebu the couldn otha veto ldw hether what he felt was pain or pleasure
he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying
the docket ofthese ssion was very heavy the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases
the yha dbe gun with the infanticide and now they had reached the convict the old offender the return horse
this man had stolen apple sbu tth at did not appear to be entirely proved what had been proved was that he had already been in the galleys at toulon
it was that which lent a bad aspect to his case
however the man 's examination and the deposition soft hewit nesses had been completed but the lawyer 's plea and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come it could not be finished before midnight
the man would probably be condemned the attorney general was very clever and never missed his culprits he was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses

he inquired of this usher will the door be opened soon sir
it will not be opened at all replied the usher

it is probable that he was holding counsel with himself
the violent conflict which had been going on with in him since the preceding evening was not yet ended and every moment he encountered some new phase of it
on reaching the landing place he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms

when the usher discreetly opening the door which connected the council chamber with the courtroom be nto vert he back of the president 's armchair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just perused adding the gentleman desires to be present at the trial the president with a quick and deferential movements ei zed ape nand wrote a few words at the bottom of the paper and return edit tothe usher saying admit him
the unhappy man who se history wearer ela ting had remained near the door of the hall in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him
in the midst of his rever yhe heard someone saying to him will monsieur dome the honor to follow me
it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but am omen tpr evi ously and who was now bowing to the earth before him
atthe sametime the usher handed him the paper
he unfolded it and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it

he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him as trang eand bitter aftertaste

the last words of the usher who had just quit ted him still ran gin his ears monsieur you are now in the council chamber you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door and you will find yourself in the courtroom behind the president 's chair
the sew or dsw ere mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridor sand dark staircase sw hich he had recently traverse d
the usher had left him alone
the supreme moment had arrived
he sought to collect his faculties but could not
it is chiefly at the moment when the reis the greatest need for attaching the mto the painful realities of life that the thread soft hough tsn a pwi thin the brain
he was in the very place where the judges deliberate dan dc on dem ned
with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where soma ny lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his name and which his fate was a tth at moment traversing
he stared at the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be he
he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the jolts of the car tbu the was not conscious of it
it seemed to him that he felt nothing
he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicolas pac he may or of paris and minister and dated through an error nod ou btt he tho fj une of the year ii
and inwhich pac he forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by the m
any spectator who had chance dto see him at that moment and who had watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and here adit two or three times
here adit without paying any attention to it and unconsciously
he was thinking of fantin eand cosette
as he dreamed he turned round and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes
he had almost forgotten that door
his glance calm at first paused the re remained fixed on that brass handle the ngr ewt err ified and little by little became impregnated with fear
beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples
at acer tain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which does sowell convey pardi eu
who compels me to this
the nhe wheeled briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him went to it opened it and passed out
he was nolonger in that chamber he was outside in a corridor along narrow corridor broken by step sand gratings making all sorts of angles light edhe re andthe re by lanterns similar to the night tape rof invalid sthe corridor through which he had approached
he breathed helis ten edn ota sound infront not as ound behind him and he fled as though pursued
when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listen ed
the same silence reigned and the rewa sthe same darkness around him
he was out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall
the stone was cold the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow hestra ight ened himself up with a shiver
the nth ere alone in the darkness trembling with cold and with something else to oper chance he meditated
he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard within him but one voice which said alas
aqua rte rof an hour passed thus
at length he bowed his head sighed with a go ny dropped his arms and retrace dhis steps
he walked slowly and as though crushed
it seemed as though someone had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back
here entered the council chamber
the first thing he caught sight of was the knob of the door
this knob which was round and of polished brass shone like a terrible star for him
he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger
he could not take his eyes from it
from time to time head vance das tep and approached the door
had he listened he would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur but he did not listen and he did not hear
suddenly without himself knowing how it happened he found himself near the door he grasped the knob convulsively the door opened
he was in the courtroom
chapter ix aplac ewh erec on vic tions are in process of formation head vance dapa cec lose dthe door mechanical ly behind him and remained standing contemplating what he saw
it was a vast and badly light eda partment now full of uproar now full of silence where all the apparatus of a criminal case with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng was in process of development
atthe one end of the hall the one where he was were judges with abstract eda irin thread bare robes who were gnawing the irna ils or closing the ire yel idsa tthe other end arag ged crowd lawyers in all sorts of attitudes soldiers with hard but honest faces ancient spotted woodwork adi rt yc eil in gta bles covered with serge that was yellow rather than green door sbl ack ened by hand marks taproom lamps which emitted more smoke than light suspended from nails in the wainscot on the table scan dles in brass candle sticks darkness ugliness sadness and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law and that grand divine thing which is called justice
noone in all that throng paid any attention to him all glance swer edi rected towards a single point a wooden bench place daga in stas mall door in the stretch of wall on the president 's left on this bench illuminated by several candles sata man between two gendarmes
this man was the man
he did not see khim he saw him his eyes went thither naturally as though the yha dk now nbe for eha nd where that figure was
he thought he was looking at himself grown old not absolutely the same in face of course but exactly similar in attitude and aspect with his bristling hair with that wild and uneasy eye with that blouse just as it was on the day when he entered dfu llo fhat red concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nine teen years in collecting on the floor of the prison
he said to himself with a shudder good god

this creature seemed to be atleast sixty the rewa sso meth in gin describ ably coarsest up ida ndf right ened about him
atthe sound made by the opening door people had drawn aside to make way for him the president had turned his head and understanding that the person age who had just enter ed was the mayor of m

whither the duties of his office had called him more than once recognized him and saluted him also he had hardly perceived it he was the victim of a sort of hallucination he was watching

all this was yawning before him
he was horrified by it he shut his eyes and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul never
and by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas trembl eand rendered him nearly mad it was another self of his that was the re
all called that man who was being tried jean valjean
under his very eyes unheard of vision he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life enacted by his spectre
everything was the re the apparatus was the same the hour of the night the face soft he judges of soldiers and of spectators all were the same only above the president 's head there hung a crucifix something which the court shad lacked a tthe time of his condemnation god had been absent when he had been judged

he looked for javert but did not see him the seat of the witnesses was hidden from him by the clerk 's table and the nasw eha vej us tsai dthe hall was spare ly light ed
atthe moment of this entrance the defendant 's lawyer had just finished his plea
the attention of all was excited to the highest pitch the affair had lasted for three hours for three hours that crowd had been watching as trang eman amis erable specimen of humanity either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness
this man as the reader already know swa sava gabon dwh ohad been found in afield carrying a branch laden with ripe apple sbr oken in the orchard of an eigh bor called the pierron orchard
who was this man
an examination had been made witnesses had been heard and the yw ere unanimous light had abounded throughout the entire debate the accusations aid wehave in our grasp not only amara ude rast eal ero ffr uit wehave here in our hands aban dita no ldo ffe nder who has broken his banane xc on vic tami scre an toft hemos tda nger ousd escription am a lef actor named jean valjean who mju stice has long been in search of an dwh oei ght years ago one merging from the galleys at toulon committed a highway robbery accompanied by violence on the person of a child as a voy a rdna med little gervais acri me provided for by article of the penal code the right to try him for which were serve hereafter when his identity shall have been judicially established
he has just committed afresh the fti tisa case of a second offence condemn him for the fresh deed later on he will be judged for the old crime
in the face of this accusation in the face of the unanimity of the witnesses the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey no or else he stared at the ceiling he spoke with difficulty replied with embarrassment but his whole person from head to foot was a denial he was an idiot in the presence of all the semi nds range dino rder of battle around him and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him nevertheless it was a question of the most menacing future for him the likeness increased every moment and the entire crowd surveyed with more anxiety than he did himself that sentence freight ed with calamity which descended ever closer over his head there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded besides the galleys apos sible death penalty in case his identity were established and the affair of little gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation
who was this man
what was the nature of his apathy
was it imbecility or craft
did he understand too well or did he not understand at all
the sewer equest ions which divided the crowd and seemed to divide the jury there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case the drama was not only melancholy it was also obscure
the counsel for the defence had spoken to lera bly well in that provincial tongue which has long constitute dthe eloquence of the bar and which was formerly employed by all advocates at paris aswell as a trom or anti nora tmo nt brison and which today having become classic is nolonger spoken except by the official orators of magistracy to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorous ness and its majestic stride at on gue in which a husband is called a consort and a woman as pou sep aris the centre of art and civilization the king the monarch monseigneur the bishop asain ted pontiff the district attorney the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution the arguments the accents which we have just listened to the age of louis xiv

the pupils in the seminar ythe set enderle viti ese rro rsi mpu ted to newspapers the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs etc
the lawyer had accordingly begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apple san awkward matter couched in finest yle but benign ebo ssue thi msel fwa so blige dto all ude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration and he extricated himself from the situation in state lyf as hi on
the lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apple shad not been circumstantial ly proved
his client who mhe in his character of counsel persisted in calling champ mathieu had not been seen scaling that wall nor breaking that branch by anyone
he had been taken with that branch which the lawyer preferred to call abou ghin his possession but he said that he had found it broke no ffa nd lying on the ground and had picked it up
where was the rea ny proof to the contrary
no doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall then thrown away by the alarm edma rau der there was no doubt that the reha dbe en at hie fin the case
but what proof was the retha tth at thief had been champ mathieu
one thing only
his character as an ex convict
the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to be unhappily well attested the accused had resided at favero lles the accused had exercised the calling of a tree pruner the re then a meo fch am pm at hieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu all that was true in short four witnesses recognize champ mathieu positive lya nd without hesitation as that convict jean valjean to the ses ign sto this testimony the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client the denial of an interest edp art yb uts up posing that he was the convict jean valjean did that prove that he was the thief of the apple s
that was a presumption at the most not apr oof
the prisoner it was true and his counseling ood faith was obliged to admit it had adopted a bad system of defence
he obstinately denied everything the theft and his character of convict
an admission upon this last point would certainly have been better and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges the counsel had advised him to do this but the accused had obstinately refused thinking no doubt that he would save everything by admitting nothing
it was an error but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consideration
this man was visibly stupid
long continued wretchedness in the galleys long misery outside the galleys had brutalized him etc
he defended himself badly was that are as on for condemning him
as for the affair with little gervais the counsel need not discuss it it did not enter into the case
the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court ifthe identity of jean valjean appeared to the mto be evident to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his banan dno tthe frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence
the district attorney answered the counsel for the defence
he was violent and florida sdi strict attorneys usually are
he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty and skilfully to oka dva nta geo ft his loyalty
here ached the accused through all the concession smad eby his lawyer
the advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was jean valjean
he took note of this
so this man was jean valjean
this point had been conceded to the accusation and could nolonger be disputed

the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of the ramen ewh ichi snot useful to tragedy but whichever yday renders great service sto judicial eloquence
the audience and the jury shuddered
the description finished the district attorney resume dwi than oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day and it is such a man etc
etc
etc
vagabond beggar without means of existence etc
etc
in ured by his past life to culpable deeds and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys as was proved by the crime committed against little gervais etc
etc
it is such a man caught up on the highway in the very act of the fta few paces from a wall that had been scaled still holding in his hand the object stolen who denies the crime the theft the climbing the wall denies everything denies even his own identity

what does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity
his denial
what obd urac y
you will do justice gentlemen of the jury etc
etc
while the district attorney was speaking the accused listened to him open mouthed with a sort of amazement in which some admiration was assured ly blended
he was evidently surprised that aman could talk like that
from time to time at those energetic moments of the prosecutor 's speech when eloquence which can not contain itself over flows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm he moved his head slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which he had content ed himself since the beginning of the argument
two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice that is what comes of not having asked m
bal oup
the district attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude evidently deliberate which denote dno tim be cility but crafts killah abit of deceiving justice and which set forth in all its nakedness the profound perversity of this man
he ended by making his reserves on the affair of little gervais and demanding as ever ese nte nce
at that time as the reader will remember it was penal servitude for life
the counsel for the defence rose began by complimenting monsieur l' avocat general on his admirable speech then replied as best he could but he weakened the ground was evidently slipping away from under his feet
chapter xthe system of denial sthe moment for closing the debate had arrived
the president had the accused stand up and address edt ohim the customary question have you anything to add to your defence
the man did not appear to understand ashes to odt here twisting in his hands at err ible cap which he had
the president repeated the question
this time the man heard it
he seemed to understand
he made a motion like a man who is just waking up cast his eyes about him stared at the audience the gendarmes his counsel the jury the court laid his monstrous fist on the rim of woodwork in front of his bench to okano the rlo okan dalla to nce fixing his glance upon the district attorney he began to speak

in the absence of sieur javert it hink it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said he rea few hours ago

the name of this man is not champ mathieu he is an ex convict name dj ean valjean and is very vicious and much to be feared
it is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term

the district attorney concluded by insisting that in default of javert the three witnesses brevet chen il die uand coche pail les hould be heard on cem or eand solemnly interrogated
the president transmitted the order to an usher and am omen tla tert he door of the witnesses ' room opened

coche pail lewa sno less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner
he was one of those wretched men who mna ture has sketched out for wild beasts and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys
the president tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words and asked him as he had asked the other two if he persisted with out hesitation or trouble in recognizing the man who was standing before him
he is jean valjean said coche pail le
he was even called jean the screw because he was so strong

after the second he said alittle louder with an air that was almost that of satisfaction good

this indecision only lasted a few seconds

not amout hbr eat he dthe first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave those with inthe hall experience dth at sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done
in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district attorney and a few low to ned words with the assistant judges headdress edt he public and asked in accents which all understood is the reap hys icia npr ese nt

it was a smile of triumph it was also as mile of despair

in that chamber there were nolonger either judges accusers norge nda rme sthe re was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing heart s
noone recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play the district attorney for goth ewa sthe ref or the purpose of prosecuting the president that he was the reto preside the counsel for the defence that he was the reto defend
it was a striking circumstance that no question was put that no authority intervened
the peculiarity of sublime spectacles is that the yca pt urea lls oul sand turn witnesses in to spectators
noone probably could have explained what he felt no one probably said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of agra nd light all felt themselves in ward lyda zz led
it was evident that the yha dj ean valjean before the ire yes
that was clear
the appearance of this man had suffice dto suff use with light that matter which had been so obscure but am omen tpr evi ously without any further explanation the whole crowd as by a sort of electric revelation understood instantly and at asin gle glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead

it was an impression which vanished speedily but which was irresistible at the moment

he directed his steps towards the door

madeleine contemplates his hair the day had begun to dawn
fantin ehad passed asleep less and feverish night filled with happy vision sat daybreak she fell asleep
sisters impli ce who had been watching with her availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare an ew potion of chin chon a
the worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments bending over her drugs and phial sands crut in izing things very closely on account of the dimness which the half light of dawn spread so vera llo bject s
suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek
m
madeleine stood before her he had just enter eds ile ntl y
is it you mr
mayor
she exclaimed
here plied in a low voice how is that poor woman
not so bad just now but we have been very uneasy
she explained to him what had passed that fantin ehad been very ill the day before and that she was better now because she thought that the mayor had gone to mont ferme il together child
the sister dared not question the mayor but she perceived plainly from his air that he had not come from the re
all that is good said he you were right not to und ece ive her
yes responded the sister but now mr
mayor she will see you and will not see her child
what shall we say to her
here flected for a moment
god will inspire us said he
but we can not tell a lie murmured the sister half aloud
it was broad daylight in the room
the light fell full on m
madeleine 's face
the sister chance dtor aise here yes to it
good god sir
she exclaimed what has happened to you
your hair is perfectly white
white
said he
sisters impli ceh a dno mirror
she rummaged in a drawer and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he nolonger breathed
m
madeleine to okt he mirror looked at his hair and said well
he uttered the word indifferent lya ndas though his mind were on something else
the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this
he inquired can i see her
isnot monsieur le maire going to have her child brought back to her
said the sister hardly venturing to put the question
ofcourse but it will take two or three days atleast
if she were not to see monsieur le maire until that time went on the sister timidly she would not know that monsieur le maire had returned and it would be easy to inspire her with patience and when the child arrived she would naturally think monsieur le maire had just come with the child
we should not have to enact a lie
m
madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments the nhes aid with his calm gravity nosis teri must see her
ima yper haps be in haste
the nun did not appear to notice this word perhaps which communicate dan obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor 's speech
she replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully in that case she is asleep but monsieur le maire may enter
he made some remarks about a door which shut badly and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman then he entered fantin e 's chamber approach edt he bed and drew aside the curtains
she was asleep
her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies and which breaks the heart so fmo the rsw he nthe yare watching through the night beside the irs lee ping child who is condemned to death
but this painful respiration hardly trouble das or to fine ffa bles eren it yw hich overspread her countenance and which transfigured her in her sleep
her pallor had become whiteness her cheeks were crimson herlong golden lashes the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her pal pita ted thought he yr emai ned closed and drooping
her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings allready to open wide and bear her away which could be felt as the yr us tled thought he yc ould not be seen
to see her thus one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of
she resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying
the branch trembl es when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and seems to both with draw and to offer itself at one and the same time
the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death area bout to pluck the soul
m
madeleine remained for sometime motionless beside that bed gazing in turn upon the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months before onthe day when he had come forth efi rst time to see her in that asylum
the yw ere both still there in the same attitude she sleeping he praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair was gray and his was white
the sister had not entered with him
he stood beside the bed with his finger on his lips as though the re were someone in the chamber who mhe must enjoin to silence
she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile and cosette
chapter ii fantin eha pp ys he made no movement of either surprise or of joy she was joy itself
that simple question and cosette
was put with so profound afa it hwi ths om uch certain ty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt that he found not a word of reply
she continued ikn ewt hat you were there
iwasa sleep but is a wyo u
ihave seen you for along longtime
ihave been following you with my eyes all night long
you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of celestial for ms
her aise dhis glance to the crucifix
but she resumed tell me where cosette is
why did not you place her on my bed against the moment of my waking
he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall
fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance
he came to the aid of m
madeleine
calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here
fantin e 's eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light
she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness
oh
she exclaimed bring her to me
touching illusion of a mother
cosette was for her still the little child who is carried
not yet said the doctor not just now
you still have some fever
the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm
you must be cured first
she interrupted him impetuously but i am cured
oh it elly out hat iam cured
what an ass that doctor is
the idea
iwan tto see my child
you see said the doctor how excited you become
solon gas you are in this state is hall oppose your having your child
it is not enough to see her itis necessary that you should live for her
when you are reasonable iwill bring her to you myself
the poor mother bowed her head
i beg your pardon doctor ire all ybe gyo urp ardo n

that is all
is it not quite natural that is hould desire to see my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from mont ferme il
iam not angry
iknow well that i am about to be happy
all night long ihave seen white things and persons who smiled at me
when monsieur le docteur please she shall bring me cosette
ihave nolonger any fever iam well

when it is seen that i am very calm the yw ills a y 's hem us tha veh erc hild

madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed
she turned towards him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in order that seeing her so peaceable the ym ight make no difficulty about bringing cosette to her
but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m
madeleine
did you have a pleasant trip monsieur le maire
oh
how good you were to go and get her for me
only tell me how she is
did she stand the journey well
alas
she will not recognize me
she must have forgotten me by this time poor darling
children have no memories
the yare like birds
ach il dse eso nething today and another thing tomorrow and think so fno thing any longer
and did she have whiteline n
did those the nardi ers keep her clean
how have the yf edhe r
oh
if you only knew how ihave suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness
now it is all past
iam happy
oh how is hould like to see her
do you think he rpr etty monsieur le maire
isnot my daughter beautiful
you must have been very cold in that diligence
could she not be brought for just one little instant
she might be taken away directly after wards
tell me you are the master it could be so if you chose
he took her hand
cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well
you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much vivacity and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes and that makes you cough
infact fits of coughing interrupted fantin eat nearly every word
fantin edi dno tm urm urs he feared that she had injured by her to opas sion at elam entation sthe confidence which she was desirous of inspiring and she began to talk of indifferent things

madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitate d
the doctor having finished his visit retired

she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath and began to listen with rapture

it was one of those accidents which are always occurring and which seem to form apart of the mysterious stages etting of mournful scenes

madeleine heard her say in a low voice how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter
that man has an evil countenance that he has
but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again
she continued to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how happy wear ego in gto be
we shall have a little garden the very first thing m
madeleine has promised it to me
my daughter will play in the garden
she must know her letters by this time

she began to laugh
he had released fantin e 's hand
he listened to her words as one listens to the sighing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom
all at once she ceased speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanical ly
fantin ehad become terrible
she nolonger spoke she nolonger breathed she had raised herself to as it ting posture her thin should ere merged from her chemise her face which had been radiant but am omen tbe for ewa sgh as tly and she seemed to have fixed here yes rendered large with terror on something alarming at the other extremity of the room
good god
he exclaimed what ails you fantin e
she made noreply she did not remove here yes from the object which she seemed to see
she removed one hand from his arm and with the other made him as i gnt olo ok behind him
he turned and beheld javert
chapter iii javert satisfied this is what had taken place
the half hour after midnight had just struck when m
madeleine quitted the hall of assizes in a rras
here gained his inn justin time to set out again by the mail wagon in which he had engaged his place
alittle before six o'clock in the morning he had arrived at m
sur m
and his first care had been to post a letter to m
laffitte the nto enter the infirmary and see fantin e
however he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of assizes when the district attorney recovering from his first shock had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of m
sur m
to declare that his conviction shad not been in the least modified by that curious incident which would be explained the rea fter and to demand in the meantime the condemnation of that champ mathieu who was evidently the real jean valjean
the district attorney 's persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of everyone of the public ofthe court and ofthe jury
the counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that in consequence of the revelation so fm
madeleine that is to say ofthe real jean valjean the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered and that the jury had before the ire yes no won lya ninn oce nt man
the nce the lawyer had drawn some epiphone mas not very fresh unfortunately upon judicial errors etc
etc
the president in his summing up had joined the counsel for the defence and in a few minutes the jury had thrown champ mathieu out of the case
nevertheless the district attorney was benton having a jean valjean and as he had no longer champ mathieu he took madeleine
immediately after champ mathieu had been set at liberty the district attorney shut himself up with the president
the yc on ferred as to the necessity of seizing the person of m
lemaire of m
sur m
this phrase in which the rewa sag re at deal of of isthe district attorney 's written with his own hand on the minutes of his report to the attorney general
his first emotion having passed off the president did not offer many objections
justice must after all take it scours e
and the nw he nall was said although the president was a kind lya nda to lera bly intelligent man he was a tthe sametime adev ote dan dal most ana rd entro yali stand he had been shocked to hear the mayor of m

say the emperor and not bonaparte when all udi ngt othe landing at cannes
the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched
the district attorney for war dedit to m

by a special messenger at full speed and entrusted its execution top oli cei nspe ctor javert
the reader knows that javert had returned to m
sur m
immediately after having given his deposition
javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner
the messenger himself was avery clever member of the police who in two words informed javert of what had taken place at a rras
the order of arrests ign ed by the district attorney was couched in the sew or dsi nspe ctor javert will apprehend the body of the sieur madeleine mayor of m

who in this day 's session of the court was recognized as the liberated convict jean valjean
anyone who did not know javert and who had chance dto see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary could have divine dno thing of what had taken place and would have thought his air the most ordinary inthe world
he was cool calm grave his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation
anyone who was thoroughly acquainted with him and who had examined him attentively at the moment would have shuddered
the buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of atthe nape of his neck
this betrayed unwonted agitation
javert was a complete character who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform method ical with malefactors rigid with the buttons of his coat
that he should have set the buckle of his stock awry it was indispensable that the res hould have taken place in him on eof those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes
he had come in a simple way had made are quis it ion onthe neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers had left the soldiers in the courtyard had had fantin e 's room pointed out to him by the port res sw how asu tter ly unsu spic ious accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor
on arriving at fantin e 's chamber javert turned the handle pushed the door open with the gentleness of asic knu rse or apo lice spy and entered
properly speaking he did not enter
he stood erect in the half open door his hat on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat which was button edu pto the chin
in the bend of his elbow the lead en head of his enormous can ewh ich was hidden behind him could be seen
thus here maine dfor nearly a minute without his presence being perceived
all at once fantin era is edhe reyes saw him and made m
madeleine turn round
the instant that madeleine 's glance encountered javert 's glance javert without stirring with out moving from his post without approaching him became terrible
no human sentiment can be aster rib leas joy
it was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul
the satisfaction of atlas tge tting hold of jean valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance
the depths having been stirred up mounted to the surface
the humiliation of having in some slight degree lost the scent and of having indulged for a few moments in an error with regard to champ mathieu was effaced by pride at having sowell and accurately divine dint he first place and of having for solo ngc her ished a justin sti nc t
javert 's contents hone for thin his sovereign attitude
the deformity of triumph over spread that narrow brow
all the demonstration so fh or ror which as a tis fied face can afford were there
javert was in heaven at that moment
without putting the thing clearly to himself but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success he javert personified justice light and truth in the irc eles tial function of crushing out evil
behind him and around him at an infinite distance he had authority reason the case judge dthe legal conscience the public prosecution all the stars he was protecting order he was causing the law to yield up its thunder she was avenging society he was lending ahelp in ghan dto the absolute he was standing erect in the midst of a glory
the re existed in his victory are mna nto fde fiance and ofcom bat
erect haughty brilliant he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel
the terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist happy and indignant hehe ldh is heel upon crime vice rebellion perdition hell he was radiant he exterminated he smiled and the rewa san incontestable grandeur in this monstrous saint michael
javert though frightful had nothing ignoble about him
probity sincerity can do rconv ict ion these nse of duty are things which may be come hideous when wrongly directed but which even when hideous remain grand the irma jest ythe majesty peculiar to the human conscience clings to the mint he midst of horror they are virtues which have one vice error
the honest pitiless joy of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserve sace rtai nlug ubr ious ly venerable radiance
without himself suspecting the fact javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied as is every ignorant man who triumph s
nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this face where in was displayed all that maybe designated as the evil of the good
chapter iv authority reasserts its rights fantin ehad not seen javert since the day on which the mayor had to rn her from the man
her ailing brain comprehended nothing but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come together
she could not endure that terrible faces he felt her life quitting her she hid her face in both hands and shrieked in her anguish monsieur madeleine save me
jean valjean we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise had risen
he said to fantin ein the gentlest and calmest of voices beat ease it is not for you that he is come
the nhe address ed javert and said iknow what you want
javert replied be quick about it
the relay in the inflection of voice which accompanied the sew or dss ome thing indescribably fierce and frenzied
javert did not say be quick about it
he said bequia bou it
no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered it was nolonger a human word itwas a roar
he did not proceed according to his custom he did not enter into the matter he exhibited no warrant of arrest
in his eyes jean valjean was a sort of mysterious combatant who was not to be laid hands upon a wrestler in the dark who mhe had had in his grasp for the last five years without being able to throw him
this arrest was not a beginning but an end
he confined himself to saying be quick about it
ashes poket hushed id not advance as in gles tep he hurled at jean valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling hook and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him
it was this glance which fantin ehad felt penetrating to the very marrow of her bones two months previously
at javert 's exclamation fantin eop ened here yes once more
but the mayor was the re what had she to fear
javert advanced to the middle of the room and cried see here now
art thou coming
the unhappy woman glance dabo uther
noone was present except in gthe nunan dthe mayor
to whom could that abject use of thou be addressed
to her only
she shuddered
the nsh ebe held amos tun precedent edt hing at hing so unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the black est delirium soffe ver
she beheld javert the police spy seize the mayor by the collar she saw the mayor bow his head
it seemed to her that the world was coming to an end
javert had infact grasped jean valjean by the collar
monsieur le maire
shrieked fantin e
javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums
the reis nolonger any monsieur le maire here
jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat
he said javert javert interrupted him call me mr
inspector
monsieur said jean valjean is hould like to say a word to you in private
aloud
say it aloud
replied javert people are in the habit of talking aloud to me
jean valjean went on in a lower tone ihave are quest to make of you it elly out osp ea klo ud
but you alone should hear it what difference does that make to me
is hall not listen
jean valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in avery low voice grant me three days ' grace
three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman
iwill pay whatever is necessary
you shall accompany me if you choose
you are making sport of me
cried javert
come now i did not think you such a fool
you ask me to give you three days in which to runaway
you say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature 's child
ah
ah
that 's good
that 's really capital
fantin ewa sse ized with a fit of trembling
my child
she cried to go and fetch my child
she is not here the n
answer me sister where is cosette
iwan tm ych il d
monsieur madeleine
monsieur le maire
javert stamped his foot
and now there 's the other one
will you hold your tongue you hussy
it'sa pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates and where women of the town are cared for like countess es
ah
but we are going to change all that it is high time
he stared in tently at fantin eand added on cem or eta king into his grasp jean valjean 's cravat shirt and collar it elly out hat there is no monsieur madeleine and that the reis no monsieur le maire
the reis at hie fabri ganda convict name dj ean valjean
and ihave him in my grasp
that 's what the reis
fantin era is edhe rse lfi nbe dwi thabo und supporting herself on her stiffened arms and on both hands she gazed at jean valjean she gazed at javert she gazed at the nuns he opened her mouth as though to speak a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat her teeth chattered she stretched out her arms in her agony opening her hands convulsively and fumbling about her like a drowning person then suddenly fell back on her pillow
her head struck the headboard of the bed and fell forward son her breast with gaping mouth and staring sightless eyes
she was dead
jean valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of javert and opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby then he said to javert you have murdered that woman
let 's have an end of this
shouted javert in a fury iam not here to listen to argument
let us economize all that the guard is below march on instantly or you 'll get the thumbscrews
in the corner of the rooms to oda no ldir on bedstead which was in a decidedly decrepit state and which served the sisters as a camp be dwh ent hey were watching with the sick
jean valjean stepped up to this bed in a twinkling wrenched of fthe headpiece which was already in a dilapidated condition an easy matter to muscles like his grasp edt he principal rod like a bludgeon and glanced at javert
javert retreated to ward sthe door
jean valjean armed with his bar of iron walked slowly up to fantin e 's couch
when he arrived there he turned and said to javert in a voice that was barely audible iad vise you not to disturb me at this moment
one thing is certain and that is that javert trembl ed
it did occur to him to summon the guard but jean valjean might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape so here maine dgr as ped his cane by the small end and leaned against the door post without removing his eyes from jean valjean
jean valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed and his brow on his hand and began to contemplate the motion less body of fantin ewh ich lay extended the re
here maine dth us mute absorbed evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life
upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity
after a few moments of this meditation he bent towards fantin eand spoke to her in a low voice
what did he say to her
what could this man who was reproved say to that woman who was dead
what words were those
noone one art hhe ard the m
did the dead woman heart he m
the rear eso met ouch in gill us ions which are perhaps sublime realities
the point as to which the re exists no doubt is that sisters impli cet he sole witness of the incident of tens aid that at the moment that jean valjean whispered in fantin e 's ears hedis tinct ly beheld a nine ffa bles mile dawn on those pale lips and in those dime yes filled with the amazement of the tomb
jean valjean to okf anti ne 's head in both his hands and arranged it on the pillow as a mother might have done for her child then he tied the string of her chemise and smoothed her hair back under her cap
that done he closed her eyes
fantin e 's face seemed strange ly illuminated at that moment
death that signifies entrance into the great light
fantin e 's hand wash an ging over the side of the bed
jean valjean knelt down before that hand lifted it gently and kissed it
the nhe rose and turned to javert
now said he iam a tyo urd is posal
chapter vasu itable to mbj avert deposited jean valjean in the city prison
the arrest of m
madeleine occasion edas en sation or rather an extraordinary commotion in m
sur m
we are sorry that we can not conceal the fact that at the single word he was a convict nearly everyone deserted him
in less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten and he was nothing but acon vic tfr omt he galleys
it is just to add that the details of what had taken place at a rras were not yet known
all day long conversations like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the town you do n't know
he was a liberated convict
who
the mayor
bah
m

yes
really
his name was not madeleine at all he had a frightful name be jean boje an bou jean
ah
good god
he has been arrested
arrested
in prison in the city prison while waiting to be transferred
until he is transferred
heist obe transferred

he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago
well
is us pected as much
that man was too good to oper fect to oaf fected
here fused the cross he bestowed sous on all the little scamp she came across
i always thought there was some evil history back of all that
the drawing room spa rti cular lya bounded in remarks of this nature
one old lady as ubs crib ert othe drapeau blanc made the following remark the depth of which it is impossible to fathom iam not sorry
it will be a lesson to the bona part is ts
it was thus that the phantom which had been called m
madeleine vanished from m
sur m
only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory
the old port res sw hoh a dse rv ed him was among the number
onthe evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodges till i nath or ough fright and absorbed in sadr efl ection s
the factory had been closed all day the carriage gate was bolted the street was deserted
the rewa sno one in the house but the two nuns sister per pet uea nds is ters impli ce who were watching beside the body of fantin e
towards the hour when m
madeleine was accustomed to return home the good port res sros emec hani call yto ok from a drawer the key of m
madeleine 's chamber and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his quarters the nsh eh ung the key on the nail when ceh ewa sacc us to me dto take it and set the candlestick on one side as though she was expecting him
the nsh esat down again on her chair and became a bs or bed in thought once more
the poor good old woman had done all this without being conscious of it
it was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from her rever yandex claimed hold
my good god jesus
and i hung his key on the nail
at that moment the small window in the lodge opened a hand passed through seized the key and the candlestick and light edt he tape rat the candle which was burning the re
the port res sra is edhe reyes and stood there with gaping mouth and as hri ek which she confined to her throat
she knew that hand that arm the sleeve of that coat
it was m
madeleine
it was several seconds before she could speak she had a seizure as she said herself when she related the adventure afterwards
good god monsieur le maire she cried at last it hough tyo uwe res he stopped the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect to ward sthe beginning
jean valjean was still monsieur le maire to her
he finished her thought
in prison said he
iwas the re ibr ok eab a rof one of the windows ile tm ys elf drop from the top of a roof and here iam
iam going up to my room go and find sisters impli cef or me
she is with that poor woman no doubt
the old woman obeyed in all haste
he gave her noord ers he was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself
noone ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard with out opening the big gates
he had an dal ways carried about him a pass key which opened alittle side door but he must have been searched and his latchkey must have been taken from him
this point was never explained
he ascended the staircase leading to his chamber
on arriving at the top hele ft his candle on the top step of his stairs opened his door with very little noise went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling the nre turned for his candle and reentered his room
it was a useful precaution it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street
he cast a glance about him at his table at his chair at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days
not race of the disorder of the night before last remained
the port res shad done up his room only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty soup iec ewh ich had been blackened by the fire
he took a sheet of paper on which he wrote the sea re the two tips of my iron shod cudgel and the forty soup iec est olen from little gervais which iment ione dat the court of assizes and hear range dth is piece of paper the bits of iron and the coin in such a way that the yw ere the first thing stob ese enon entering the room
from a cupboard he pulled out on eof his old shirts which he tore in pieces
in the strips of line nth us prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks
he betrayed neither has tenor agitation and while he was wrapping up the bishop 's candlestick she nibbled at apiece of black bread
it was probably the prison bread which he had carried with him in his flight
this was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on
the rec amet wot a psat the door
come in said he
it was sisters impli ce
she was pale here yes were red the candle which she carried trembl edin her hand
the peculiar feature of the violence so fde sti ny is that however polished or cool we may be the yw ring human nature from our very bowels and for cei tto reappear on the surface
the emotions of that day had turned the nun in to a woman once more
she had wept and she was trembling
jean valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper which he handed to the nuns ayin gsis ter you will give this to monsieur le cure
the paper was not folded
she cast a glance upon it
you can read it said he
she read ibe gmo nsi eur lec ure to keep an eye on all that i leave behind me
he will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial and ofthe funeral of the woman who died yesterday
the rest is for the poor
the sister tried to speak but she only managed to stammer afew inarticulate sounds
she succeeded in saying however does not monsieur le maire desire to take a last look at that poor unhappy woman
no said he iam pursued it would only end in the ira rre sting mein that room and that would disturb her
he had hardly finished when aloud noise became a udi ble on the staircase
the yhe arda tumult of ascending footsteps and the old port res ssa ying in her loudest and most piercing to nes my good sir is wear to you by the good god that not as oul has entered this house all day nor all the evening and that ihave not even left the door
aman responded but there is a light in that room nevertheless
the yr eco gni zed javert 's voice
the chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner of the wall on the right
jean valjean blew out the light and placed himself in this angle
sisters impli cef ellon her knees near the table
the door opened
javert entered
the whispers of many men and the protestations of the port res swer eau di ble in the corridor
the nun did not raise her eyes
she was praying
the candle was on the chimney piece and gave but very little light
javert caught sight of the nunan dhal ted in amazement
it will be remembered that the fundamental point in javert his element the very air he breathed was veneration for all authority
this was impregnable and admitted of neither objection nor restriction
in his eyes of course the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all he was religious superficial and correct on this point as on all other s
in his eyes apr ies twas a mind who never make sami stake an un was a creature who never sins the yw eres oul swall edin from this world with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to passthrough
on perceiving the sister his first movement was to retire
but there was also another duty which bound him and impelled him imperiously in the opposite direction
his second movement was to remain and to venture on atleast one question
this was sisters impli ce who had never told a lie in her life
javert knew it and held her in special veneration in consequence
sisters aid hear eyo ual one in this room
at err ible moment ensued during which the poor port res sfe lta sth ough she should faint
the sister raised here yes and answered yes
the nres ume dj avert you will excuse me if i persist it is my duty you have not seen acer tain person amant his evening
he has escaped wear eins earch of him that jean valjean you have not seen him
the sister replied no
she lied
she had lied twice in succession one after the other without hesitation promptly as a person does when sacrificing herself
pardon me said javert and here tired with a deep bow
osa in ted maid
you left this world many years ago you have rejoined your sister sthe virgin sandy our brothers the angels in the light may this liebe counted to your credit in paradise
the sister 's affirmation was for javert so decisive at hing that he did not even observe the singularity of that can dle which had but just been extinguished and which was still smoking on the table
an hour later aman marching amid trees and mists was rapidly departing from m
sur m
in the direction of paris
that man was jean valjean
it has been established by the testimony of two or three carter sw home thi mth at hew as carrying a bundle that he was dressed in a blouse
where had he obtained that blouse
noone ever found out
but an aged work man had died in the infirmary of the factory afew days before leaving behind him nothing but his blouse
perhaps that was the one
one last word about fantin e
we all have a mother the earth
fantin ewa sgi ven back to that mother
the cure thought that he was doing right and perhaps here all yw asin reserving a smu chm one yas possible from what jean valjean had left for the poor
who was concerned after all
acon vic tanda woman of the town
that is why he had a very simple funeral for fantin eand reduced it to that strictly necessary for mkn own as the pauper 's grave
sofa nti new as buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to anybody and everybody and where the poor are lost
fortunately god knows where to find the soul again
fantin ewa slaid in the shade among the first bones that came to hand she was subjected to the promiscuous ness of ashes
she was thrown into the public grave
her grave resembled her bed

chapter iii the eighteenth of june let us turn back that is one of the storyteller 's rights and put ourselves on cem or ein the year and even alittle earlier than the epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book to ok place
if it had not rained in the night between the than dthe tho fj une the fate of europe would have been different
afew drops of water more or less decided the downfall of napoleon
all that provide ncer equired inorder to make waterloo the end of austerlitz was alittle more rain and a cloud traversing the sky out of seasons uffi ced to make a world crumble
the battle of waterloo could not be begun until half past eleven o'clock and that gave blucher time to come up
why
because the ground was wet
the artillery had to wait until it became a little firmer before the yc ould manoeuvre
napoleon was an artillery officer and felt the effects of this
the foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who in the report to the directory on a bou kir said such a one of our balls killed six men
all his plans of battle were arranged for project iles
the key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point
he treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel and made a breach in it
he overwhelmed the weak point with grapes hot he joined and dissolved battle swith cannon
the rewa sso meth in gof the sharpshooter in his genius
to be at ins quare stop ulver ize regiment stob re akl in esto crush and disperse masses for him everything layin this to strike strikes trike incessantly and he intrusted this task to the cannonball
are doubt able method and one which united with genius rendered this gloomy athlete of the pug il is mof war invincible for the space of fifteen years
onthe tho fj une here lied all the more on his artillery because he had number son his side
wellington had only one hundred and fifty nine mouth so ffi rena pole on had two hundred and for ty
suppose the soil dry and the artillery capable of moving the action would have begun at six o'clock in the morning
the battle would have been won and ended at two o'clock three hours before the change of fortune in favor of the prussians
what amount of blame attaches to napoleon for the loss of this battle
isthe shipwreck due to the pilot
was it the evident physical decline of napoleon that complicated this epoch by an inward diminution of force
had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard the soul aswell as the body
did the veteran make himself disastrous lyfe lti nthe leader
in a word was this genius as many historians of note have thought suffering from an eclipse
did he goin to a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened power sfr omh ims elf
did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure
had he become a grave matter in a general unconscious of peril
isthe re ana gein this class of material great men who may be called the giants of action when genius grows shortsighted
old age has no hold on the geniuses of the ideal for the dante sand michaelangelo sto grow old is to growing re atn essi sit to grow less for the hannibal sand the bonaparte s
had napoleon lost the direct sense of victory
had her each edt he point where he could nolonger recognize the reef could nolonger divine the snare nolonger discern the crumbling brink of abysses
had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophe s
he who had informer days known all the road st otri ump hand who from the summit of his chariot of lightning pointed the mou twit has over eign finger had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it to the precipice
washes ei zed at the age of forty six with a supreme madness
was that titanic charioteer of destiny nolonger anything more than an immense daredevil
we do not think so
his plan of battle was bythe confession of all am ast erp iec e
to go straight to the centre of the allies ' line to make a breach in the enemy to cut the mint wot odr ive the british halfback on hala ndt he prussian half onto ngr est omake two shattered fragments of wellington and blucher to carry mon tsai nt jean to seize brussels to hurl the german into the rhine and the english man in to the sea
all this was contained in that battle according to napoleon
afterwards people would see
ofcourse wed on other epr eten dto furnish a history of the battle of waterloo one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are relating is connected with this battle but this history is not ours ub ject this history moreover has been finished and finished in a master lyman nerf rom one point of view by napoleon and from another point of view by a whole ple iad of historians

it was the retha tthe lion has been placed the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the imperial guard
the triangle included in the top of the abet we ent he two limbs and the tie is the plateau of mont saint jean

the two general shada tte nti vel yst udi edt he plain of mont saint jean now called the plain of waterloo
in the preceding year wellington with the sagacity of foresight had examined it as the possible seat of agreat battle
upon this spot and forth is due lon the tho fj une wellington had the good post napoleon the bad post
the english army was stationed above the french army below
it is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of napoleon on horseback glass in hand upon the height so fro sso mme at daybreak on june
all the world has seen him before we can show him
that calm profile under the little three corner edhat of the school of brienne that green uniform the white revers concealing the star of the legion of honor his great coat hiding his epaulets the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his vest his leather trousers the whitehorse with the saddle cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corner scr owned n ' sand eagles hessian boots over silk stockings silver spurs the sword of marengo that whole figure of the last of the caesars is present to all imagination ssa lute dwi tha ccla mation sby some severely regarded by others
that figure stood for along time wholly in the light this arose from acer tain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes and which always veils the truth for along ero rsh or tert ime but today history and daylight have arrived

the affair began late
napoleon as we have already explained was in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand like a pistol aiming it now at one point now at another of the battle and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop free ly
inorder to do that it was necessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil
but the sun did not make it sapp ear an ce
it was nolonger the rendezvous of austerlitz
when the first cannon was fired the english general colville looked at his watch and not edt hat it was thirty five minutes past eleven

at half past three o'clock in the morning he lost one illusion of ficer sw hoh a dbe end espa tche dtor econ no it rea nno unced to him that the enemy was not making any movement
nothing was stirring not a bivouac fire had been extinguished the english army was asleep
the silence on earth was profound the only noise was in the heavens
at four o'clock ape as an twas brought into him by the scouts this peasant had served as guide to a brigade of english cavalry probably vivian 's brigade which was on its way to take up a position in the village of oha in a tthe extreme left

in consequence of the rain sdu ring the night the transport so fpr ovis ions embedded in the soft roads had not been able to arrive by morning the soldiers had had no sleep the yw ere we tan dfas ting
this did not prevent napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to ney wehave ninety chance souto fah und red
at eight o'clock the emperor 's breakfast was brought to him
he invited many general sto it
during breakfast it was said that wellington had been to a ball two nights before in brussels at the duchess of richmond 's and soul taro ugh man of war with a face of an archbishop said the ball takes place to day
the emperor jest ed with ney who said wellington will not be so simple as to wait for your majesty
that was his way however
he was fond of jesting says fleury dec hab oul on
amer ry humor was a tthe foundation of his character says gour gaud
he abounded in pleasantries which were more peculiar than witty says benjamin constant
the sega yet ies of agian tare worthy of insistence
it was he who called his grenadiers his grumble rsh epi nch edt heir ears he pulled the irm us taches

aman who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events
napoleon indulged in many fits of this laughter during the breakfast at waterloo
after breakfast he meditated for a quarter of an hour the nt wog eneral sse at edt he msel ves on the truss of straw pen in hand and the irpa per on the irk nees and the emperor dictated to the mthe order of battle

afew moments after the formation of the battle array in the midst of that profound silence like that which herald sthe beginning of astor mwh ich precedes engagement sthe emperor tapped hax oon the shoulder as he beheld the three batteries of twelve pounders detached by his orders from the corps of erl on reil lean dlo bau and destined to begin the action by taking mon tsai nt jean which was situated at the intersection of the nivel les and the gena pper oad sands aid to him there are four and twenty handsome maids general

everyone is aware that the various lyin cline dun dula tions of the plains where the engagement between napoleon and wellington took place are nolonger what they were on june
by taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it its real relief has been taken away and history disconcerted nolonger find she rbe arin gst here
it has been disfigured for the sake of glorifying it
wellington when he beheld waterloo once more two years later exclaimed the yha veal tered my field of battle
where the great pyramid of earth surmounted by the lion rises to day there was a hillock which descended in an easy slope towards the nivel les road but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to gena ppe
the elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great sepulchre sw hich enclose the road from gena ppe to brussels on ethe english to mbi son the left the other the german to mbi son the right
the reis no french to mb
the whole of that plain is a sepulchre for france
thanks to the thousands upon thousands of car tlo ads of earth employed in the hill ock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference the plateau of mont saint jean is now accessible by an easy slope
onthe day of battle particularly on the side of la hai esa in tei twas a brup tan ddi ffi cult of approach
the slope the reiss ost eep that the english cannon could not see the farm situated in the bottom of the valley which was the centre of the combat
onthe tho fj une the rain shad still farther increased this acclivity the mud complicated the problem of the ascent and the men not only slipped back but stuck fast in the mire
along the crest of the plateau rana sort of trench whose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine
what was this trench
let us explain

the sevilla ges both of the mco ncea led in curves of the landscape are connected by a road about a league and a half in length which traverses the plain along its undulating level and often enter sandbur ies itself in the hills like a furrow which makes a ravine of this road in some places

onthe day of battle this hollow road whose existence was in now ayin dicated bordering the crest of mont saint jean at ren chat the summit of the escarpment a rut concealed in the soil was invisible that is to say terrible

composed half of light and half of shadow napoleon thought himself protected in good and tolerated in evil
he had ortho ugh tth at heh ada connivance one might almost say acom plicit yof events in his favor which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity
nevertheless when one has beres in a leipzig and fontainebleau behind one its eem sast hough one might distrust waterloo
amy steri ous frown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens
atthe moment when wellington retreated napoleon shuddered
he suddenly beheld the table land of mont saint jean cleared and the van ofthe english army disappear
it was rallying but hiding itself
the emperor half rose in his stirrups
the lightning of victory flash edf rom his eyes
wellington driven into a corner at the forest of so i gne sand destroyed that was the definitive conquest of england by france itwas crecy poitiers mal plaque tan dram ill ies avenged
the man of marengo was wiping out agincourt

he pondered he examined the slopes not edt he dec livi ties scrutinized the clumps of trees the square of rye the path he seemed to be counting each bush

near this barricade he observed the old chapel of saint nicholas painted white which stands at the angle of the crossroad near brain el ' all eu dhe be ntd own and spoke in a low voice to the guide lacoste
the guide made an egat ives ign with his head which was probably perfidious
the emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking
wellington had drawn back
all that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him
napoleon turning round abruptly despatched an express at full speed to paris to announce that the battle was won
napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts
he had just found his clap of thunder
he gave orders to milhaud 's cuirass iers to carry the table land of mont saint jean

this figure probably comprises a llt he other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat
let us note in passing that it was dubois 's sorely tried brigade which an hour previously making a charge to one side had captured the flag of the lunenburg battalion
napoleon before giving the order for this charge of milhaud 's cuirass iers had scrutinized the ground but had not been able to see that hollow road which did not even for mawr in kle on the surface of the plateau
warned nevertheless and put on the alert bythe little white chapel which marks its angle of junction with the nivel les highway he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle to the guide lacoste
the guide had answered no
we might almost affirm that napoleon 's catastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant 's head
other fatalities were destined to arise
was it possible that napoleon should have won that battle
we answer no
why
because of wellington
because of blucher
no
because of god

another series of facts was in preparation in which the rewa sno longer any room for napoleon
the ill will of events had declared itself long before
it was time that this vast man should fall
the excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance
this individual alone counted for more than a universal group
the sep let horas of all human vitality concentrated in asin gle head the world mounting to the brain of one man this would be mortal to civilization were it to last

napoleon would have won the battle of waterloo
by any other route than that below plan ceno it the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery and bulow would not have arrived
now the prussian general muffling declares that one hour 's delay and blucher would not have found wellington on his feet
the battle was lost
it was time that bulow should arrive as will be seen
he had more over been very much delayed
he had bivouac ked at dion lemon tan dha dset out at daybreak but the road sw ere impassable and his division sst uck fast in the mire
the ruts were up to the hubs of the cannon s
moreover he had been obliged to pass the dy leon the narrow bridge of wavre the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the french so the caissons and ammunition wagons could not pass between two rows of burning house sand had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished
it was midday before bulow 's vanguard had been able to reach chapelle saint lambert
had the action been begun two hours earlier it would have been over at four o'clock and blucher would have fallen on the battle won by napoleon

but it remained motionless in the mist
all the glasses of the staff had studied the cloud pointed out by the emperor
some said it is trees
the truth is that the cloud did not move
the emperor detached do mon 's division of light cavalry to reconnoitre in that quarter
bulow had not moved in fact
his vanguard was very feeble and could accomplish nothing
he was obliged to wait for the body of the army corps and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before entering into line but at five o'clock perceiving wellington 's peril blucher ordered bulow to attack and uttered the sere markable words we must give a irt othe english army

wellington oddly ungrateful declares in a letter to lord bathurst that his army the army which fought on the tho fj une was a detestable army
what does that sombre intermingling of bones buried beneath the furrows of waterloo think of that
england has been too modest in the matter of wellington

the iron soldier is worth a smu chas the iron duke
as for us all our glorification goes to the english soldier to the english army to the english people
if trophy the rebe it is to england that the trophy is due
the column of waterloo would be more just if instead of the figure of amani tbo re on high the statue of a people
but this great england will be angry at what we are saying here
she still cherishes after her own and our the feudal illusion
she believes in heredity and hierarchy
this people surpassed by none in power and glory regards itself as an ation and not as a people
and asap eople it will ingly subordinate sits elf and takes a lord for its head
as a workman it allows itself to be disdained as a soldier it allows itself to be flogged
it will be remembered that at the battle of inkerman naser geant who had it appears save dthe army could not be mentioned by lord pag lanas the english military hierarchy does not permit any her obe low the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the report s
that which we admire above all in an encounter of the nature of waterloo is the marvellous cleverness of chance

onthe whole let us say it plainly it was more of amass a cre than of a battle atwater loo
of all pitched battles waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such an umber of combatants

waterloo by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the sword had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction
the slashers have finished it was the turn of the thinkers
the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march
that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty
in short and incontestably that which triumphed atwater loot hat which smiled in wellington 's rear that which brought him all the marshals ' staff so feu rope including it is said the staff of a marshal of france that which joyously trundle dthe barrows full of bones to erect the knoll of the lion that which triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date june that which encouraged blucher as he put the flying army to the sword that which from the height soft he plateau of mont saint jean hovered over france as over its prey was the counterrevolution
it was the counterrevolution which murmured that infamous word dismemberment

we are not ofthe number of those who flatter war when the occasion present sits elf we tell the truth about it
war has frightful beauties which we have not concealed it has also we acknowledge some hideous features
one of the most surprising is the prompts tripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory
the dawn which follows a battle always rise son naked corpses
who does this
who thus soils the triumph
what hideous furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory
what pickpockets are the yw hop lyth eir trade in the rear of glory

nevertheless on the night from the tht othe tho fj une the dead were robbed

he was clad in a blouse that was something like a great coat he was uneasy and audacious he walked forward sand gazed behind him
who was this man
the night probably knew more of him than the day
he had no sack but evidently he had large pockets under his coat

the nocturnal prowler who mwe have just shown to the reader was going in that direction
he was searching that vast to mb
he gazed about
he passed the dead in some sort of hideous review
he walked with his feet in the blood

he bent down again fumbled among the heap pushed aside everything that was in his way seized the hand grasped the arm free dthe head pulled out the body and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless or atleast the unconscious man through the shadows of hollow road

the ship orion chapter in umber becomes number jean valjean had been recaptured
the reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad details
wewill confine ourselves to transcribing two paragraphs published by the journal soft hat day afew months after the surprising events which had taken place at m
sur m
the sea rticle sare rather summary
it must be remembered that at that epoch the gazette dest rib una ux was not yet in existence
web or rowth efi rst from the drapeau blanc
it bears the date of july
an arrondissement of the pas de calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course
aman who was a stranger in the department and who bore the name of m
madeleine had thanks to the new methods resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry them an ufa ctu re of jet and of black glass trinkets
he had made his fortune in the business and that of the arrondissement aswell we will admit
he had been appointed mayor in recognition of his services
the police discovered that m
madeleine was no other than an ex convict who had broken his banco nde mne din for the fta ndn am ed jean valjean
jean valjean has been recommitted to prison
it appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of m
laffitte as umo fov erh alfa million which he had lodged there and which he had more over and by perfectly legitimate means acquired in his business
noone has been able to discover where jean valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at toulon
the second article which enters alittle more into detail is an extra ctf rom the journal depar is ofthe same date
afor merco nvi ctw hoh a dbe en liberated name dj ean valjean has just appeared before the court of assizes of the varun der circumstances calculated to attract attention
this wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police he had changed his name and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern town sin this town he had established a considerable commerce
he has atlas tbe en unmasked and arrested thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor
he had for his concubine a woman of the town who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest
this scoundrel who is endowed with her cul ean strength found means to escape but three or four days after his flight the police laid the ir hands on him once more in paris itself at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of mont ferme ilse in eet oise
he is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers
this sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs
if the indictment is to be trusted he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone and it has not been possible to lay hands on it
however that maybe the said jean valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the department of the varas accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence about eight years ago on the person of one of those honest children who asthe patriarch of ferney has said in immortal verse
arrive from savoy every year and who with gentle hands doc lear those long canals choked up with soot
this band it refused to defend himself
it was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor that the theft was committed in complicity with other sand that jean valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south
jean valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence
this criminal refused to lodge an appeal
the king in his inexhaustible clemency has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life
jean valjean was immediately taken to the prison at toulon
the reader has not forgotten that jean valjean had religious habits at m
sur m
some papers among others the constitution al presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party
jean valjean change dhis number in the galleys
he was called
however and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject the prosperity of m

deville lec all eda tte nti onto the fact in the rostrum in the month of february
chapter iii nw hich the reader will peruse two verses which are ofthe devil 's composition possibly before proceeding further it will be to the purpose to narrate in some detail as in gular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch in mont ferme ilan dwh ichi snot lacking in coincidence with certain conjecture soft he indictment
the re exists in the region of mont ferme ila very ancient superstition which is all the more curious and all the more precious because apo pula rs up erst it ion in the vicinity of paris is like an aloe in siberia
we are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant
here the nist he superstition of mont ferme ilit is thought that the devil from time immemorial has selected the forest asahi ding place for his treasures
good wives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at night fall in secluded nooks of the forest abla ckm an withthe air of a carter or a wood chopper wearing wooden shoes clad in trousers and a blouse of line nand recognizable by the fact that instead of a capo rhat he has two immense horns on his head
this ought infact to render him recognizable
this manisha bit ually engaged in digging a hole
the rear eth re eway so fpr of it in gb ysu chan encounter
the first is to approach the man and speak to him
the niti sse ent hat them an iss imply a peasant that he appears black because it is nightfall that he is not digging any hole whatever but is cutting grass for his cows and that what had been taken for horns is not hing but a dung for kwh ich he is carrying on his back and whose teeth thanks to the perspective of evening seemed to spring from his head
the man returns home and dies within the week
the second way is to watch him to wait until he has dug his hole until he has filled it and has gone away the nto run with great speed to the trench to open it once more and to seize the treasure which the black man has necessarily place dthe re
in this case one dies within the month
finally the last method is not to speak to the black man not to look at him and to flee at the best speed of one 's legs
one then dies within the year
as a llt hree methods are attended with the irs pecial inconvenience sthe second which at all events present sso mead vantage sam on got her sth at of possessing a treasure if only for a month is the one most general lya do pte d
sobol dme nw hoare tempted by every chance have quite frequently as we are assured opened the holes excavated by the black man and tried to rob the devil
the success of the operation appears to be but moderate
atleast i fthe tradition is to be believed and in particular the two enigmatic all in esi nba rba rous latin which an evil norman monk abit of a sorcerer name dtr yp hon has left on this subject
this tryp hon is buried at the abbey of saint george sde boche rv ill enea rro uen and to a dss pawn on his grave
accordingly enormous efforts are made
such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep aman sweats digs to ilsa lln ight for it must be done at night he wet shi ssh i rtb urns out his candle breaks his mattock and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole when he lays his hand on the treasure what does he find
what is the devil 's treasure
as ous ome times acro wnp iec easton eas kele to nab lee ding body sometimes aspect ref old edin four like a sheet of paper in a portfolio sometimes nothing
this is what try phon 's verses see mto announce to the indiscreet and curious fod it et info ssat he sauro sco ndi to paca as num mas lapides cadavers im ula cran ihi lq ue
it seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powderhorn with bullets sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and worn which has evidently served the devil
try phon does not record the set wof in dssi nce try phon live dint he twelfth century and since the devil does not appear to have had the witt oin vent powder before roger bacon 's time and cards before the time of charles vi
moreover if one plays a tca rds one is sure to lose all that one possesses
and as for the powder in the horn it possesses the property of making your gun burst in your face
now avery short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict jean valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around mon tfe rme ilit was remarked in that village that acer taino ldr oad laborer name dbo ula true lle had peculiar way sin the forest
people there about sth ought they knew that this boul at ruelle had been in the galleys
he was subjected to certain police supervision and as he could find work nowhere the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road mender on the crossroad from gag nyt ola gn y
this boul at ruelle was a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the district as to ores pect ful to oh umb let oop rom pti nrem ovi nghi scap to everyone and trembling and smiling in the presence of the gendarmes probably affiliate dtor obb erba nds the ysa ids us pected of lying in ambush at verge of cops esat nightfall
the only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard
this is what people thought they had noticed of late boul at ruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone breaking and care of the road at avery early hour and to be taking himself to the forest with his pickaxe
he was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearing sin the wildest thickets and he had the appearance of being in search of something and sometimes he was digging holes
the good wives who passed to ok him at first for beelzebub the nth eyre cogni zed boul at ruelle and were not in the least reassured the re by
the seen counters seemed to cause boul at ruelle alive lyd is pleasure
it was evident that he sought to hide and that the rewa sso me mystery in what he was doing
it was said in the village it is clear that the devil has appeared
boul at ruelle has seen him and is on the search
in sooth he is cunning enough to pocket lucifer 's hoard
the volta irian sad de dwi llb oul at ruelle catch the devil or will the devil catch boul at ruelle
the old women made a great many signs of the cross
in the meantime boul at ruelle 's manoeuvres in the forest ceased and here sumed his regular occupation of road mending and people gossip edo fso meth in gels e
some persons however were still curious sur mis in gth at in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legend sbu tso me fine windfall of amores eri ousa ndp alpa bles or tth an the devil 's bank bills and that the road mender had half discovered the secret

he has been in the galleys said the nardi er
eh
good god
noone know sw hoh a sbe ent here or will be the re
one evening the school master affirmed that inform ert imes the law would have instituted a nin qui rya stow hat boul at ruelle did in the forest and that the latter would have been forced to speak and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need and that boul at ruelle would not have resisted the water test for example
let us put him to the winetest said the nardi er
the yma dean effort and got the old road mender to drinking
boul at ruelle drank a nen or mousa mount but said very little
he combined with admirable art and in master ly proportion sthe thirst of ago rman dizer with the discretion of a judge
nevertheless by dint of returning to the charge and ofcom paring and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him this is what the nardi era ndt hesch ool master imagine dth at the yha dma de out on emo rning when boul at ruelle was on his way to his work at daybreak he had been surprised to see at an ook of the forest in the underbrush as hovel and apic ka xe concealed as one might say
however he might have supposed that the yw ere probably the shovel and pick of fathers i xf our sthe water carrier and would have thought no more about it
but on the evening of that day he saw without being seen himself as he was hidden by a large tree apers on who did not belong in those parts and who mhe boul at ruelle knew well directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood
translation by the nardi era comrade of the galleys
boul at ruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name
this person carried apac kage something square like a large box or as mall trunk

however it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that person had occurred to him
but it was too late the person was already in the thicket night had descended and boul at ruelle had not been able to catch up with him
the nhe had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods
it was moonlight
two or three hours later boul at ruelle had seen this person emerge from the brushwood carrying nolonger the coffer but as hovel and pick
boul at ruelle had allowed the person to pass and had not dreamed of accost in ghi mbe cause he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was an dar med with a pickaxe and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him and on perceiving that he was recognized
touching effusion of two old comrades on meeting again
but the shovel and pick had served as a ray of light to boul at ruelle he had hastened to the thicket in the morning and had found neither shovel nor pick
from this he had drawn the inference that this person once in the forest had dug a hole with his pick buried the coffer and rec lose dthe hole with his shovel
now the coffer was too small to contain a body therefore it contained money
hence his research es

it was joys plen do rri ches happiness which appeared in a sort of chimeric al halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery
with the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll
she said to herself that one must be a queen or atleast a princess to have a thing like that
she gazed at that beautiful pink dress that beautiful smooth hair and she thought how happy that doll must be
she could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall
the more she looked the more dazzled she grew
she thought she was gazing at paradise

the man halted he set the bucket on the ground be ntd own and placed both hands on the child 's shoulders making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark
cosette 's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky

the man seemed to have received an electric shock
he looked at her once more then here moved his hands from cosette 's shoulders seized the bucket and set out again

from time to time she raised here yes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence
she had never been taught to turn to provide ncea ndt opra yn ever the less she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven
several minutes elapsed

another pause ensued

this is the gentleman
said she
yes madame replied the man raising his hand to his hat
wealthy travellers are not so polite
this gesture and an inspection of the stranger 's costume and baggage which the then a rdi erp assed inreview with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear
she resumed dryly enter my good man
the good man entered
the then a rdi erc as tas econ dgl an cea thi mpa idpa rti cular attention to his frock coat which was absolutely thread bare and to his hat which was alittle battered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up here yes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carter s

that 's true added her husband gently it ruins aho use to have such people in it
in the meantime the man laying his bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass
the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water to oki tto his horse himself
cosette resume dhe rpl ace under the kitchen table and her knitting
the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention
cosette was ugly
if she had been happy she might have been pretty
wehave already given as ketch of that sombre little figure
cosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hard lys i x
her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping
the corner so fhe rmo uth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people
her hands were asher mother had divine dru in edw it hch il blain s
the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees on eagain stth eot her
here nti re clothing was but a rag which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter
all she had on wash ole ridden line nno tasc rap of woollen
her skin was visible here and the rea nde very where black and blues pots could be descried which marked the place sw here the then a rdi erw oman had to uche dhe r
her naked legs were thin and red
the hollow sinh erne ck were enough to make one weep
this child 's whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the interval sw hich she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole idea fear
fear was diffused all over her she was covered with its oto speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips with drew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy a slit tle space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting of no possible variation except an increase
in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished no ok where terror lurked
her fear was such that on her arrival we tass he was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and dry herself but sat silently down to her work again
the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming a nid iot or a demon
as we have stated she had never know nw hat it is to pray she had never set foot in a church
have it het ime
said the then a rdi er
the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette
all at once the then a rdi ere xcl aimed by the way where 's that bread
cosette according to her custom whenever the then a rdi eru pli fte dhe rv oic eem erg ed with great haste from beneath the table
she had completely forgotten the bread
she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear
she lied
madame the baker 's shop was shut
you should have knocked
id id knock madame
well
he did not open the door
i'll find out tomorrow whether that is true said the then a rdi era ndi fy oua retelling meal ie i'll lead you apr etty dance
in the meantime give me back my fifteen soup iec e
cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green

cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it
what could have become of that money
the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say
she was petrified
have you lost that fifteen soup iec e
screamed the then a rdi erh oars ely or do you want to rob me of it
atthe sametime she stretched out her arm towards the cato ' nine tails which hung on an ai lint he chimney corner
this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek mercy madame madame
iwill not do so anymore
the then a rdi ert ook down the whip
in the meantime the man in the yellow coat had been fumbling in the fob of his waistcoat without any one having noticed his movements
besides the other travellers were drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything
cosette contract edhe rse lfi nto aba llw it hang uis hwi thin the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half nude limbs
the then a rdi err aise dhe rar m
pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little one 's apron pocket and rolled aside
perhaps this is it
atthe sametime he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment
exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up
and he held out as i lve rco into the then a rdi er
yes that 's it said she
it was not it for it was a twenty soup iec ebu tthe the nardi erf ound it to her advantage
she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remark don't let this ever happen again
cosette returned to what the then a rdi erc all edhe rke nne land her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as the yha dne ver worn before
thus far it was only an innocent amazement but as orto fst up efi edco nfi dence was mingled with it
by the way would you like some supper
the then a rdi erin quired of the traveller

he appeared to be absorbed in thought

she muttered between her teeth
he 's some frightfully poor wretch
he has n't as out opa yfor as upper
will he even pay me for his lodging
it 's very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor
in the meantime ado or had opened and epon in eand a zelma entered

all at once the then a rdi erw hoh a dbe eng oing back and forth in the room perceived that cosette 's mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at the irp lay

she cried

i'll make you work to the tune of the whip that iwill
the stranger turned to the then a rdi erw ithout quitting his chair

such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten as liceo fmu tto nand had drunk aco up leo fbo ttl eso fwi new it hhi ssu pper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order
but that aman with such a hats hould permit himself such a desire and that aman with such a coats hould permit himself to have a will was something which madame the nardi erd id not intend to tolerate

the carter was so much to uche dby the five franc piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up
but it 's true
he cried examining it

the nardi era pproach edan dsi lent ly put the coin in his pocket

she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred
in the meantime cosette was trembling
she ventured to ask is it true madame

and while he rmo uth thanked the then a rdi erh erw hole little soul than ked the traveller
the nardi erh adres ume dhis drinking his wife whispered in his ear who can this yellow man be

cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat
cosette always moved as little as possible
she picked up some old rags and her little leads word from a box behind her
epon in eand a zelma paid no attention to what was going on

while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the butterfly 's wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast
you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other
she twists she cries she is warm
see sister let us play with her
she shall be my little girl

while epon in eand a zelma were bundling up the cat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword
that done she laid it in her arms and sang to its of tly to lull it to sleep
the doll is one of the most imperious needs and atthe sametime one of the most charming instincts of feminine childhood
to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold alittle to rock to dan dle to lull to sleep to imagine that something is someone there in lies the whole woman 's future
while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while sewing little gowns and corsages and bodice sthe child grows into a young girl they oung girl in to a big girl the big girl in to a woman
the first child is the continuation of the last doll
alittle girl with out a doll is almost as unhappy and quite a sim possible as a woman with out children
so cosette had made herself a doll out of the sword
madame the nardi era pproach edt hey ellow man my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m

her mother did n't amount to much added the then a rdi ers he abandoned her child
during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion had not take nh ere yes from the then a rdi er 's face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and the re
meanwhile the drinkers all three quarters intoxicated were repeating the irun clean refrain with redoubled gay et yit was a highly spiced and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced
the then a rdi erw ent of fto take part in the shouts of laughter
cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her fixed eyes
she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead
my mother is dead
my mother is dead
on being urged afresh by the hostess the yellow man the millionaire consent eda tlas tto takes up per

decided lyh eisa beggar thought madame the nardi er
the drunken men were still singing the irs on gand the child under the table was singing her s

madame the nardi erw as whispering to her husband and counting over some money poni nea nd zelma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her
she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that noone was watching her the nsh esl ipp ed quickly upto the doll and seized it
an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned so as to cast as had owo nthe doll which she held in her arms
the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness
noone had seen here xc ept the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper
this joy last eda bout a quarter of an hour
but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the doll 's legs stuck out and that the fire on the heart hli ght edit up very vividly
that pink and shining foot project in gfr omt he shadows ud den lys truck the eye of a zelma who said to epon in elook

let me alone
said he rmo the rwh at doy ou want
mother said the child look there
and she pointed to cosette
cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession nolonger saw or heard anything
madame the nardi er 's countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named mega eras
onthis occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further
cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to the sey oung ladies
ac zarina who should see a muz hi ktr ying on her imperial son 's blue ribbon would wear no other face
she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse within dig nation cosette
cosette started as though the earth had trembl ed beneath her she turned round

repeated the then a rdi er
cosette to okt he doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair the nwi thou tta king here yes from its hecla sped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that age she wrung the mthe nno to neo fthe emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest north ewe ight of the bucket of water north elo sso fthe money north esi ght of the whip noreve nthe sad words which she had heard madame the nardi eru tter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing
meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet
what is the matter
he said to the then a rdi er

said the then a rdi erp oint in gto the corpus delicti which lay at cosette 's feet
well what of it

that beggar replied the then a rdi erh as permitted herself to touch the children 's doll

said the man well what if she did play with that doll
she touched it with her dirty hands
pursued the then a rdi erw it hhe rfr ight ful hands

screamed the then a rdi er
the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out
as soon as he had gone the then a rdi erp rof it ed by his absence to give cosette a heart yk ick under the table which made the child utter loud cries
the door opened again the man reappeared he carried in both hands the fabulous doll which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it upright in front of cosette saying here this is for you
it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more which he had spent the re he had taken confused notice through his rever yof that toys hop light edu pby fire pots and candles so splendid lyth at it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop
cosette raised here yes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll the nsh esl owl yr etre at edan dhi dhe rse lfa tthe extreme end under the table in acorn ero fthe wall

the tavern keepers tare dal tern at ely at the doll and atthe traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out a bag of money
this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning
he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice that machine costs atleast thirty francs
non on sense

cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror
her face was still flooded with tears but here yes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy
what she felt at that moment was alittle like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly to ldl it tle one you are the queen of france
it seemed to her that if she touched that doll lightning would dart from it
this was true upto acer tain point for she said to herself that the then a rdi erw ould scold and beat her
nevertheless the attraction carried the day
she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame the nardi erma yim adam e

the stranger 's eyes seemed to be full of tears
he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where amando esn ots peak for fear lest he should we ep
he nodded to cosette and placed the lady 's hand in her tiny hand
cosette hastily with drew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor
we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue immoderate ly
all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport

it was an odd moment when cosette 's rags meta ndc las ped the ribbon sand fresh pink muslin soft he doll

this strange rth is unknown individual who had the air of avis it which provide nce was making on cosette was the person who mthe the nardi erh at edw or set hanan yon ein the world at that moment
however it was necessary to control herself
habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure
she made haste to send her daughter stob edt hens he asked the man 's permission to send cosette of fals of ors he has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air
cosette went off to be dcar rying catherine in her arms

cosette was in a profound sleeps he was fully dressed
in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so cold
against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark

beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes

the stranger stepped into it
atthe further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds

it was two tiny children 's shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size

it was like an intuition he comprehended it with his clear and sagacious prompt it ude
while drinking with the carter ssm okin gand singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician
he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing
not a movement not ages ture on the part of the man in the yellow great coat had escaped him
even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette the nardi erh add iv in edh is purpose
he had caught the old man 's deep glance sre turning constantly to the child
who was this man
why this interest
why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse
questions which he put to himself with out being able to solve the man dwh ichi rri tate dhi m
he had pondered it all night long
he could not be cosette 's father

this man evidently had no right over cosette
what was it then

he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing
beth at a sit may one nter in ginto conversation with the man sure that the rewa sso me secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the stranger 's clear and firm retort that this mysterious person age was mysterious in so simple away he became conscious that he was weak
he had expected nothing of the sort
his conjecture swer epu tto the rout

he weighed everything in the space of a second
the nardi erw as one of those men who take in a situation at a glance
he decided that the moment had arrived for proceedings trai ght forward and quickly at that
he did as great leaders do atthe decisive moment which the yk now that the yal one recognize he abruptly unmasked his batteries
sir said he iam in need of fifteen hundred francs
the stranger to okf rom his side pocket an old pocketbook of black leather opened it drew out three bank bills which he laid on the table
the nhep laced his large thumb on the notes and said to the innkeeper go and fetch cosette
while this was taking place what had cosette been doing
on waking up cosette had run together shoe
in its he had found the gold piece
it was not an apo leon it was one of those perfectly new twenty franc pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath
cosette was dazzled
her destiny began to intoxicate her
she did not know what ago ldp iec ewa ssh ehad never seen on esh ehi dit quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it
still she felt that it really was her ssh eg ues sed when ceh erg if thad come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear
she was happy above all she was stupefied
such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real
the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her
she trembl ed vaguely in the presence of this magnificence
the stranger alone did not frighten her
onthe contrary here assured her
ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little child is hmi nd of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind
everything had changed for her since she had met that goodman in the forest
cosette less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven had never know nw hat it was to take refuge under a mother 's shadow and under a wing
for the last five years that is to say as far back asher memory rant he poor child had shivered and trembled
she had always been exposed completely naked tothe sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed
formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm
cosette was nolonger afraid of the then a rdi er
she was nolonger alone there was someone there
she has til ys eta bout her regular morning duties
that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket when cet he fifteen soup iec ehad fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts
she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told
as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless for get ful of her broom and ofthe entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket
it was during one of the seper iod so fcon temp lation that the then a rdi erj oin edhe r
she had gone in search of cosette at her husband 's orders
what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her

this bundle contained alittle woollen gown an apron a fust ian bodice aker chief ape ttic oat woollen stockings shoes acom plete outfit for a girl of seven years

cosette was going away

she knew not
all that she understood was that she was leaving the then a rdi ert ave rnb ehi nd her
noone had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of anyone
she was leaving that hated and hating house
poor gentle creature who sehe art had been repressed upto that hour
cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky
she had put her louis inthe pocket of her new apron
from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the good man
she felt something as though she were beside the good god

he folded up the three bank bills thrust the mint oh is pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first
some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the lark and the man had been seen going in the direction of liv ry

the renear afac to ryan dbe tween two garden walls there could be seen at that epoch am ean building which atthe first glance seemed as small as a thatched hovel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral
it presented its side and gable to the public road hence its apparent diminutive ness
nearly the whole of the house was hidden
only the door and one window could be seen
this hovel was only one story high
the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a hovel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being in rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lord lyman sion
the door was nothing but acoll ection of worm eaten plan ks roughly bound together by cross beams which resembled roughly he wnl ogs
it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalk yp last erst aine ddu st yst eps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls

this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus be held on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different mien sbe neath the same rags the one having always been amend icant and the other having once been agent leman
the staircase led to avery vast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house
this edifice had for its intestinal tube along corridor on which opened to right and left sort so fco mpa rtm ents of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells

now according to local tradition this maitre go rbe a uha dbe ent he proprietor of the building number edon the boulevard de l' hopital
he was even the author of the monumental window
hence the edifice bore the name of the go rbe a uh ouse
opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose agreat elm which was three quarters dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barrier edes gobelins as tree tthe nwi thou thou ses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended square lyin the exterior wall of paris
an odor of copper as issued in puffs from the roof soft he neighboring factory
the barrier was close at hand
in the city wall was still in existence
this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind
it was the road to bice tre
it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death reentered paris on the day of the irex ecution
it was the retha tabou twas committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated afri ght ful enigma which has never been unr id dled

leaving aside this place saint jacques which was a sit were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which event oday is so unattractive where stood the building number
bourgeois house son ly began to spring up the re twenty five years later
the place was unpleasant
inaddition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the sal petrie re agli mps eof whose dome could be seen and bice trew hose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men
as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoir sthe city wall and the front sofa few factories resembling barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood hovels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cerec lot hsn eww hit ewa lls like winding sheets everywhere parallel rows of trees building ser ected on a line flat construction slon gco ldr ows and the melancholy sadness of right angles
not an uneven ness of the ground not a caprice in the architecture not a fold
the ensemble was glacial regular hideous
nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry
it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is a tthe very foundation of grief
despair yawns
something more terrible than a hell where one suffers maybe imagine dan dth at isa hell where one is bored
if such a hell existed that bit of the boulevard de l' hopital might have formed the entrance to it
nevertheless at night fall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms the irl as truss et leaves when the darkness is deep and starless or when the moon and the wind are making opening sin the clouds and losing the mse lve sin the shadows this boulevard suddenly become sfr ight ful
the black lines sink in wards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite
the passerby can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet
the solitude of this spot where soma nyc rimes have been committed had something terrible about it
one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused for msoft he darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly in the evening melancholy by night it was sinister
in summer at twilight one saw her eand the rea few old women seated at the foot of the elmo nbe nch esm ould yw it hra in

however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air waste nding event he ntot ran sfor mation
even at that time anyone who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste
each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing
for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does today
wherever it is placed on the border sofa capital arai lwa yst ation is the death of a suburban dthe birth of a city
it seems as though around the segre at centre soft he movements of a people the earth full of germs trembl edan dy a wn edt oen gulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring forth at the rattle of the sep ower ful machines at the breath of the semon str ous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire

one morning am emo rable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking there on that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue de l' our cine and that parishad entered the suburb of saint marceau
chapter ii an est for owl and a warbler it was in front of this go rbe a uh ouse that jean valjean halted
like wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his nest
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket drew out as orto fapa ssk eyo pened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette
atthe to po fthe stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door
the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor at able and several chairs as to vein which afire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner
alan tern on the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room
atthe extreme end there was adressing room with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down the re without waking her
he struck a match and light edac and le
all this was prepared beforehand on the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began to scrutinize cosette 's face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amount edt oab err ation
the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extremes treng than dex treme weakness had fallen asleep with out knowing with whom she was an dc ontinued to sleep with out knowing where she was
jean valjean be ntd own and kissed that child 's hand
nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep
the same sad piercing religious sentiment filled his heart
he knelt beside cosette 's bed
lt was broad daylight and the child still slept
awan ray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and layup on the ceiling in long thread so flight and shade
all at once a heavily laden carrier 's car twh ich was passing along the boulevard shook the frail be dli kea clap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom
yes madame
cried cosette waking with a start here iam
here iam
and she sprang out of bed here yes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall
ah
mon dieu my broom
said she
she opened her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean
ah
so it is true
said the child
goodmorning monsieur
children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiar ly being themselves by nature joy and happiness
cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean
where was she
was paris very large
was madame the nardi erv ery faraway
was she togo back
etc
etc
all at once she exclaimed how pretty itis here
it was a frightful hole but she felt free
must is weep
she resumed at last
play
said jean valjean
the day passed thus
cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man
chapter iii two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by cosette 's bedside he watched the remo tion less waiting for her to wake
some new thing had come into his soul
jean valjean had never loved anything for twenty five years he had been alone in the world
he had never been father love rhus band friend
in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy
the heart of that exco nvi ctw as full of virginity
his sister and his sister 's children had left him only a vague and far off memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find the man dno tha ving been able to find the mhe had forgotten the m
human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss
when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him
all the passion and affection with in him awoke and rushed to ward sth at child
he approached the bed where she lays lee ping and trembled with joy
he suffered a llt hepa ngso fam other and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and avery sweet thing
poor old man with a perfect lyne whe art
only as he was five and fifty and cosette eight years of age all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flowed together into a sort of ineffable light
it was the second white apparition which he had encountered
the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise on his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise
the early days passed in this dazzled state
cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become an other being poor little thing
she was so little when he rmo the rle fthe rth at shen olo nger remember edhe r
like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded
all had repulsed her the then a rdi erst heir children other children
she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her
it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimate ditt hat at eight years of age her heart was cold
it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked a las
it was the possibility
thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking power slo ved this kind man
she felt that which she had never felt before as ens ation of expansion
the man nolonger produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the hovel pretty
the sea re the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy
the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here
nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness on agar re t
we all have in our past adel ight ful garret
nature adi ffe rence of fifty years had set apr of ound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf
destiny suddenly united and wedded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existence sdiff erin gina geal ike in sorrow
one in fact completed the other
cosette 's instincts ought afa the ras jean valjean 's instincts ought ach il d
to meet was to find eachother
atthe mysterious moment when the ir hands touched the yw ere we lde dto get her
when the set wos oul sper ceived eachother the yr eco gni zed eachother as necessary to eachother and embraced eachother closely
taking the words in the irmo stc omprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from everyone bythe walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become cosette 's father after a celestial fashion
and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping her sin the dark was not an illusion but are ality
the entrance of that man in to the destiny of that child had been the advent of god
moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well
the re he seemed perfectly secure
the chamber with adressing room which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window open edon the boulevard
this being the only window in the house none igh bors ' glance swer etob efe are dfr omac ross the way or at the side
the ground floor of number as orto fdi lapid at edp ent house served as a wagon house for market garden ersa ndn oco mmu nication existed between it and the first story
it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps nor stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building a sit were
the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attic son lyon eof which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean valjean 's housekeeping all the rest was uninhabited
it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodge randi nre ality intrusted with the functions of port res sw hoh a dle thi mthe lodging on christmas eve
he had represented himself to her as agent leman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter
he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room as we have seen
it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of the ira rri val
week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that hovel
cosette laughed chattered and sang from daybreak
children have the irmo rning song aswell as birds
it sometimes happen edt hatje an valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with chil blain sand kissed it
the poor child who was used to be in gbe at end id not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion
at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown
cosette was nolonger in rags she was in mourning
she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life
jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read
sometimes as he made the child spell here member edt hat it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison
this idea had ended in teaching ach il dtor ead
the nth eex convicts mile dwi tht he pensive smile of the angels
he felt in it apr emed itation from on high the will of someone who was not mana nd he became a bs or bed in rever y
good thoughts have the ira by sses aswell as evil ones
to teach cosette to read and to let her play this constituted nearly the whole of jean valjean 's existence
and the nhe talked of her mother and he made her pray
she called him father and knew no other name for him
he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle
life henceforth appeared to him to be full of interest mens eem edt ohim good and just hen olo nger reproached anyone in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be avery oldman now that this child love dhi m
he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light
the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts
at times here flected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly
this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by nome an scl ear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well doing
he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under an ewa spec tin complete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited on esi de ofthe truth the fate of woman ass umm edu pin fantin eand public authority as personified in javert
he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quaff edf res hbi tter ness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later on luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing dim
who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and off all in gon cem or e
he loved and grew strong again
alas
he walked with no less indecision than cosette
he protected her and she strengthened him
thanks to him she could walkthrough life than kst oh erh eco uld continue in virtue
he was that child 's stay and she was his pro p
oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balance so fde sti ny
chapter iv there marks of the principal tenant jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day
every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at night fall
he liked to go to saint medard which is the nearest church
when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the child 's delight was to go out with the good man
she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous tete at etes with catherine
hehe ldh erh and as the yw al ked and said sweet things to her
it turned out that cosette was avery gay little person
the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market
the yli ved soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances
jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to cosette 's dressing room replaced by a solid door
he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat
in the street he was taken for a poor man
it sometimes happen edt hat kindhearted women turned back to be stow as ou on him
jean valjean accepted the so uwi thad eep bow
it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking alms the nhe looked behind him to make sure that noone was observing him stealthily approach edt he unfortunate man put apiece of money into his hand often as i lve rco in and walked rapidly away
this had its disadvantages
he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives a lms
the old principal lodge rac ross looking creature who was thoroughly permeated sofa rash erne igh bors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean agreat deal with out his suspecting the fact
she was alittle deaf which rendered her talkative
the re remained to her from her past two teeth on eab ove the other below which she was continually knocking against each other
she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from mont ferme il
one morning this spy saw jean valjean with an air which struck the old gossip as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the hovel
she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him
jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security nod ou bt
the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw the ncea cases cis so rsa ndt hrea dthe nh ebe gant or ip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded
the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a bank bill for a thousand francs
it was the second or third only that she had seen in the course of her existence
she fled in alarm
amo men tla terje an valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this thousand franc bill change dfor him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before
where
though tthe old woman
he did not go out until six o'clock in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour
the old woman went to get the bill change dan dme nti one dhe rs urm is es
that thousand franc not ecomm ented on and multiplied produced a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossip soft her ued esv ign essai nt marcel
afew days later it chance dth at jean valjean was sawing some wood in his shirt sleeves in the corridor
the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order
she was alone
cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed
the old woman caught sight of the coat hanging on an aila ndex amine dit
the lining had been sewed up again
the good woman felt of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and revers thickness eso fpa per
more thousand franc bank bills no doubt
she also noticed that the re were all sorts of things in the pockets
not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big pocketbook avery large knife and asus pic ious circumstances ever al wigs of various colors
each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents
thus the inhabitants of the house reached the last day so fwi nter
chapter va five franc piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult near saint medard 's church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned and on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity
he never passed this man without giving him a few sous
sometimes he spoke to him
those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police
he was an ex beadle of seventy five who was constantly mumbling his prayers
one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern which had just been lighted
the man seemed engaged in prayer according to his custom and was much bent over
jean valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary alms in his hand
the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly stared in tently at jean valjean the ndr opp ed his head quickly
this movement was like a flash of lightning
jean valjean was seized with a shudder
it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern not ofthe placid and beaming visage of the old beadle but of a well known and startling face
he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one 's self all of a sudden face to face in the dark with a tiger
here coiled terrified petrified daring neither to breathe to speak to remain nor to flee staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a ragan dno longer appear edt ok now that he was the re
at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of self preservation restrained jean valjean from uttering a word
the beggar had the same figure the same rags the same appearance as he had everyday
bah
said jean valjean iam mad
iam dreaming
impossible
and here turned profoundly trouble d
he hardly dared to confess event ohim self that the face which he thought he had seen was the face of javert
that night on thinking the matter over here gret ted not having question edt heman inorder to force him to raise his head as econ dti me
onthe following day at night fall he went back
the beggar was a this post
good day my good man said jean valjean resolutely handing him as ou
the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice thanks my good sir
it was unmistakably the ex beadle
jean valjean felt completely reassured
he began to laugh
how the deuce could ihave thought that is a wj avert the re
he thought
amigo in gto lose my eyesight now
and he thought no more about it
afew days after wards it might have been at eight o'clock in the evening he was in his room and engaged in making cosette spell aloud when he heard the house door open and the nsh uta gain
this struck him as singular
the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself always went to be dat nightfall so that she might not burnout her candles
jean valjean made as i gnt oco set tet obe quiet
hehe ards omeo neasc ending the stairs
it might possibly be the old woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary 's
jean valjean listened
the step was heavy and sound ed like that of a man but the old woman wore stout shoes and the reis nothing which so strongly resembles the step of amana sth at ofan old woman
nevertheless jean valjean blew out his candle
he had sent cosette to be dsa ying to her in a low voice get into bed very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused
jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back to ward sthe doors eat edon the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his breath in the dark
after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he heard nothing more and asher aise dhis eyes towards the door of his chamber he saw a light through the keyhole
this light for me das or to fsi nist erst arin the blackness of the door and the wall
the rewa sev ident lys omeo nether ewh owa shold in gac and lein his hand and listening
several minutes elapsed thus and the light retreated
but he heard no sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes
jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could not close his eyes all night
at daybreak just as he was falling into a doze through fatigue he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attica tthe end of the corridor the nhe heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening
the step was approaching
he sprang of fthe be dan dapp lied his eye to the keyhole which was tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night in to the house and had listened at his door as he passed
it was a man in fact who passed this time without pausing in front of jean valjean 's chamber
the corridor was too dark to allow ofthe person 's face being distinguished but when the man reached the staircase ara yof light from without made it standout like a silhouette and jean valjean had a complete view of his back
the man was of lofty stature clad in along frock coat with a cudgel under his arm
the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert
jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard but he would have been obliged to open the window he dared not
it was evident that this man had entered with a key and like himself
who had given him that key
what was the meaning of this
when the old woman came to do the work at seven o'clock in the morning jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her but he did not question her
the good woman appeared as usual
as she swept up she remarked to him possibly monsieur may have heard someone come in lastnight
at that age and on that boulevard eight o'clock in the evening was the dead of the night
that is true bythe way here plied in the most natural to nep ossi ble
who was it
it was an ew lodge rwho has come into the house said the old woman
and what is his name
id on ' tkn owe xact lyd umo nto rda umo nto rso men am eof that sort
and who is this monsieur dumont
the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered agent leman of property like yourself
perhaps she had no ulterior meaning
jean valjean thought he perceived one
when the old woman had taken her departure he did up a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard in to a rolland put it in his pocket
inspite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver ahu ndr eds oup iec eesc ape dfr omh is hands and rolled noisily on the floor
when darkness came on hed esc ended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard
he saw no one
the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted
it is true that apers on can conceal himself behind trees
he went upstairs again
come
he said to cosette
he took her bythe hand and the yb oth went out

in consequence of demolition sand reconstruction sthe paris of his youth that paris which he bore away religious lyin his memory is now apar is of days gone by
he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed
it is possible that when the author conduct shi sre ader stoa spot and says in such as tree tthe rest and ssu chan dsu chah ouse neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality
readers may verify the fact sift hey care to take the trouble
for his own part heis unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him
it is a delight to him to dream that the rest ill lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not vanished
solon gas you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are am at tero find if ference to you that those windows those roofs and those doors are not hing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter a reuse less to you that the pavement sw hich you tread are merely stones

may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present
that said web eg the reader to take note of it and we continue
jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed

the moon was full that night
jean valjean was not sorry for this
the moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets
jean valjean could glide along close to the house son the darkside and yet keep watch on the light side
he did not perhaps take sufficient lyin to consider a tion the fact that the darkside escaped him
still in the desert ed lanes which lie near the rue poli veau he thought he felt certain that noone was following him
cosette walked on without asking any questions
the suffering soft he first six years of her life had instilled something passive into her nature
moreover and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur she had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this goodman and to the freaks of destiny
and the nsh ewa swith him and she felt safe
jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette
he trusted in god as she trusted in him
it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of someone greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible
however he had no settled idea no plan no project
he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and the nit might have been javert without javert knowing that he was jean valjean
was not hedis guise d
was not hebel ie ved to be dead
still queer things had been going on for several days
he wanted no more of the m
he was determined not to return to the go rbe a uh ouse
like the wild animal chase dfr omits lair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell
jean valjean described many and varied labyrinth sin them ouf feta rd quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed he combined in various manner swith cunning strategy the rue cens ie rand the rue cope auth eru edu batt oir saint victor and the rue du pui tsl ' er mit e

he had no doubt that if anyone had chance dto be upon his track the yw ould have lost it
as eleven o'clock struck from saint etienne dumont he was traversing the rue de pontoise infront of the office of the commissary of police situated at no
afew moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round
at that moment he saw distinctly thanks to the commissary 's lantern which betrayed the mth re eme nw how ere following him closely pass on eaf tert he other under that lantern on the darkside of the street
one of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary 's house
the one who marched at the ir heads truck him as decided lys us pic ious
come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the rue pontoise
he took a circuit turned into the passage de spa tri arches which was closed on account of the hours trode along the rue de l' epee de bois and the rue de l' arba let eand plunged into the rue de spo stes
at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollins tan dsto day and where the rue neuve saint egen evie vet urns of f
it is understood ofcourse that the rue neuve saint egen evie vei san old street and that apos ting chaise does not passthrough the rue de spo stes once in ten years
in the thirteenth century this rue de spo stes was inhabited by potters and its real name is rue de spots
the moon cast a livid light into this opens pace
jean valjean went into a mbus hina doorway calculating that if the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at the mast hey traverse dth is illuminated space
in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made the ira ppe aran ce

all were tall dressed in long brown coat swith round hats and huge cudgels in the ir hands

the one who appeared to be the irl eade rtu rne dro und and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy
atthe moment when the first man wheeled round the moon fell full in his face
jean valjean recognized javert perfectly
chapter iii tis lucky that the pont d' austerlitz bears carriage sun certain ty was a tan endfor jean valjean fortunately it still last edf or the men
he took advantage of the ir hesitation
it was time lost for the mbu tga in edf or him
he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself and went down the rue de spo stes towards the region of the jardin de spla ntes
cosette was beginning to be tired
he took her in his arms and carried her
the re were no passersby and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of the rebe in gamo on
here double dhis pace
in a few strides he had reached the goblet potteries on the front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription de goblet fils c'est ici la fabrique venez choisir descr uche set des bro osd esp otsa fleurs de st uy aux del abri que

he left behind him the rue de la cleft he nthe fountains ain t victor skirted the jardin de spla ntes by the lower street san drea che dthe quay
the re he turned round
the quay was deserted
the streets were deserted
the rewa sno one behind him
he drew along breath
he gained the pont d' austerlitz
toll swer estill collected the reat that epoch
he presented himself at the toll office and handed over a so u
it is two sous said the old soldier in charge of the bridge
you are carrying a child who can walk
pay for two
he paid vexed that his passage should have aroused remark
every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away
ah ea vy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself and on its way like him to the right bank
this was of use to him
he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the car t
towards the middle of the bridge cosette whose feet were ben umb ed wanted to walk
he set her on the ground and took her hand again
the bridge on cec ross edhe perceived some timber yard son his right
he directed his course thither
inorder to reach the mit was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large uns helter edan dill umina ted space
he did not hesitate
those who were on his track had evidently lost the scent and jean valjean believe dhi msel ft obe out of danger
hunted yes followed no
alittle street the rue du chemin verts ain tanto in eop ened out between two timber yard sen closed in walls
this street was dark and narrow and seemed made express lyf or him
before entering it he cast a glance behind him
from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pont d' austerlitz
four shadows were just enter in gon the bridge
the ses had ows had the irb acks turned to the jardin de spla ntes and were on the ir way to the right bank
the sef our shadows were the four men
jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured
one hope remained to him it was that the men had not perhaps stepped on the bridge and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space holding cosette by the hand
in that case by plunging into the little street before him he might escape if he could reach the timber yard sthe marshes the market gardens the uninhabited ground which was not built upon
it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street
he entered it
chapter iii to witt he plano fpa risin three hundred paces further on hear rived at a point where the street for ked
it separated into two streets which ran in aslan ting line on eto the right and the other tothe left
jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of a y
which should hecho ose
he did not hesitate but took the one on the right
why
because that tothe left rant owa rds as ubu rbt hat is to say towards inhabited regions and the right branch towards the open country that is to say towards deserted regions
however the yno longer walked very fast
cosette 's pace retarded jean valjean 's
he took her up and carried her again
cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the good man and said not a word
he turned round from time to time and looked behind him
he took care to keep always on the darkside of the street
the street was straight in his rear
the first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing the silence was profound and he continued his march somewhat reassured
all at once on turning round he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through far off in the obscurity something which was moving
her us he dfor ward precipitate lyra the rth an walked hoping to find some sidestreet to make his escape through it and thus to break his scent once more
hear rived at a wall
this wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress itwas awal lw hich bordered at ran svers est re et inwhich the one he had taken ended
here again he was obliged to come to a decision should he got other ight or to the left
he glanced to the right
the fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either she dso rba rns the nen de data blind alley
the extremity of the cul de sac was distinctly visible aloft yw hit ewa ll
he glanced to the left
on that side the lane was open and about two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent
on that side lays a fet y
atthe moment when jean valjean was meditating at urn to the left in an effort to reach the street which he saw a tthe end of the lane he perceived as orto fmo tion less black statue at the corner of the lane and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps
it was someone aman who had evidently just been posted there and who was barring the passage and waiting
jean valjean recoiled
the point of paris where jean valjean found himself situated between the faubourg saint antoine and lara pee is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from top to bottom resulting in disfigurement according to some and in a transfiguration according to other s

thirty years ago this quarter was disappearing under the erasing process of new buildings
today it has been utterly blotted out
the petit pic puso fw hich no existing plan has preserved at race is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of published at paris by denis thierry rue saint jacques opposite the rue du plat re and at lyons by jean giri nru emer cie re atthe sign of prudence

apers oncoming from the seine reached the extremity of the rue polo ncea uand had on his right the rue droit mur turning abruptly at aright angle in front of him the wall of that street and on his right at run cated prolongation of the rue droit mur which had no issue and was called the cul de sac gen rot

the reco uld be no doubt of it
that phantom was lying in wait for him
what was he todo
the time for retreating was passed
that which he had perceived in movement an instant before inthe distant darkness was javert and his squad with out a doubt
javert was probably already a tthe commencement of the street at whose end jean valjean stood
javert to all appearances was acquainted with this little labyrinth and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit
the ses urm is esw hich so closely resemble dpr oof sw hir leds ud den ly like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected gusto fwi ndt hr ough jean valjean 's mournful brain

he saw that black forms tandi ngo uti nrel ie fag ains tthe white pavement illuminated by the moon to advance was to fall into this man 's hands to retreat was to fling himself into javert 's arms
jean valjean felt himself caught asin an e twh ich was slowly contracting he gazed heavenward in despair
chapter iv the groping so ffl ight inorder to understand what follows it is requisite to form an exact idea of the droit mur lane and in particular ofthe angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the rue polo ncea uint oth is lane
droit mur lane was almost entirely bordered on the right as far as the rue petit pic pus by house so fmea naspe cto nthe left by a solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by astor yor two asthe yapp roach edt her uep et it pic pussi des otha tth is building which was very lofty on the rue petit pic pussi de was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue polo ncea u
the reat the angle of which we have spoken it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall
this wall did not a but directly on the street it for me dade epl yr etre at ing niche concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been one in the rue polo ncea uthe other inthe rue droit mur
beginning with the sea ngl esoft he niche the wall extended along the rue polo ncea uas far as a house which bore the number and along the rue droit mur where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and whose gable it intersected thus forming another retreating angle in the street
this gable was so mbr eof aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constant lyc lose d
the state of the place so fw hich wear eher eg iv in gades crip tion is rigorously exact and will certainly awaken avery precise memory in the mind of old inhabitants of the quarter
the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door itwas avast for mles sasse mb lage of perpendicular plan kst he upper one sbe in gbr oad erth an the lower bound together by long transverse strips of iron
atone side there was a carriage gate of the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously
ali nde ntr ees how edit scre stab ove the niche and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the rue polo ncea u
in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombre building had about it as olita ryan dun inhabited look which tempted him
her an his eyes rapidly over it hesa id to himself that if he could contrive to get inside it hemi ght save himself
first he conceived an idea then a hope
in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue droit mursi de there were at all the windows ofthe different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead
the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all the sel it tle basins sketched out as orto ftree on the front
the sera mi fications of pipes with the ir hundred elbows imitated those old leafless vines to cks which writhe over the front so fold farmhouse s
this odd espa lie rw it hits branches of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean
he seated cosette with her back against aston epost with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit to uche dthe pavement
perhaps the rewa sso me way of climbing up by it and entering the house
but the pipe was dilapidated and past service and hardly hung to its fastening s
moreover all the windows ofthis silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars event heat tic windows in the roof
and the nth emo on fell full upon that facade and the man who was watching a tthe corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing
and finally what was to be done with cosette
how was she tobe drawn up to the top of a three story house
he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drainpipe and crawled along the wall to get back into the rue polo ncea u
when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette he noticed that noone could see him there
as we have just explained he was concealed from all eyes noma tter from which direction they were approaching besides this he was in the shadow
finally there were two doors perhaps the ym ight be forced
the wall above which he saw the linden tree and the ivy evidently a butte do nagar den where he could atleast hide himself although the re were as yet no leaves on the trees and spend the remainder of the night
time was passing he must act quickly
he felt over the carriage door and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in
he approached the other door with more hope it was frightfully decrepit its very immensity rendered it less solid the plan ks were rotten the iron bands there were only three of the mwe re rusted
it seemed as though it might be possible to pierce this worm eaten barrier
one xa mining it he found that the door was not a door it had neither hinges crossbar sloc kno rfis sure inthe middle their on bands traverse dit from side to side without any break
through the crevices in the plan ksh eca ugh tavi ewo fun hewn slabs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together which passersby might still have seen the rete nye ars ago
he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed
it was easy to tear off a plan kb utt henon efo undone 's self face to face with a wall
chapter v which would be impossible with gas lanterns at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance
jean valjean risk eda glance round the corner of the street
seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just de bouche dint other uep olo ncea u
he saw the gleam of the irb a yon ets

this was some patrol that javert had encountered the reco uld be no mistake as to this surmise and whose aid he had demanded
javert 's two acolytes were marching in the irr an ks
atthe rate at which the yw ere marching and in consideration of the halts which the yw ere making it would take the mabou taq uart ero fan hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood
it was a frightful moment
afew minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time
and the galleys now meant not only the galleys but cosette lost to him forever that is to say alife resembling the interior of atom b
the rewa sbu to nething which was possible
jean valjean had this peculiarity that he carried as one might say two beggar 's pouches in one he kept his saint lyth ought sin the other there doubt able talents of a convict
her umma gedi nthe one or the other according to circumstances
among his other resources thanks to his numerous escape sfr omt he prison at toulon he was a sit will be remembered apas tmas teri nthe incredible art of crawling up with out ladder or climbing irons by sheer muscular for ceb yle an in gon the nape of his neck his shoulders his hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story if need bean art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the concierge rie of paris by which batte molle condemned to death made his escape twenty years ago
jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden it was about eighteen feet in height
the angle which it for me dwi tht he gable of the large building was filled at its lower extremity by amass of masonry of atria ngu lars hap epr oba bly intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passersby
this practice of filling up corner soft he wallis much in use in paris
this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet
the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping
cosette was the difficulty for shed id not know how to climb a wall
should he abandon her
jean valjean did not once think of that
it was impossible to carry her
aman 's whole strength is required to successfully carry out the ses in gular ascent s
the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him down wards
aro pew ould have been required jean valjean had no ne
where was he toget a rope at midnight in the rue polo ncea u
certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment
all extreme situations have the irl ight ning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate us
jean valjean 's despairing glance fell on the street lantern post ofthe blind alley gen rot

the pulley over which this roper an was fastened underneath the lantern in alittle iron box the key to which was kept by the lamplighter and the rope itself was protected by a metal case
jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the street at one bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more
he had a rope

the lantern in the cul de sac gen rot was thus naturally extinct like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was nolonger in its place
nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean valjean 's absorption hissing ular gestures his going sand coming sall had begun to render cosette uneasy
anyother child than she would have given vent to loud shrieks long before
she content edhe rse lfw it hp lucking jean valjean by the skirt of his coat
the yc ould heart he sound of the patrol 's approach evermore and more distinctly
father said she in avery low voice iam a fraid
whois coming yonder
hush
replied the unhappy man it is madame the nardi er
cosette shuddered
head de dsa ynot hing
don'ti nter fere with me
if you cry out if you weep the then a rdi eris lying in wait for you
she is coming to take you back
the nwi thou tha ste but without making a useless movement with firm and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come up on him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it round cosette 's body under the armpits taking care that it should not hurt the child fastened this cravat to one end of the rope by means of that knot which seafaring men call as wall owk not to okt he other end of the rope in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which he threw over the walls tep ped upon the mass of masonry and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the gable with a smu chs oli dit yand certain tyas though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows
half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall
cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word
jean valjean 's injunction and the name of madame the nardi erh adc hill edhe rbl ood
all at once she heard jean valjean 's voice crying to her though in avery low to nep ut your back against the wall
she obeyed
don'ts ayaw or dan ddo n't be alarmed went on jean valjean
and she felt herself lifted from the ground
before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall
jean valjean grasped her put her on his back to ok her two tiny hands in his large lefthand laydown flat on his stomach and crawled along onto po fthe wall as far as the can t
as he had guessed the rest ood abu il ding whose roofs tarte dfr omt he top of the wooden barricade and descended to within avery short distance of the ground with agent les lope which grazed the linden tree
al uck yc irc ums tance for the wall was much higher on this side than on the streets ide
jean valjean could only see the ground at agreat depth below him
he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol
the thundering voice of javert was audible search the blind alley
the rue droit muris guarded
so i sthe rue petit pic pus
i'll answer for it that he is in the blind alley
the soldiers rushed into the gen rota lle y
jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the linden tree and leaped to the ground
whether from terror or courage cosette had not breathe das ound though he rhan dsw ere alittle abraded
chapter vi the beginning of an enigma jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very vast and of singular aspect one of those melancholy garden sw hich see mma de tobe looked at inwin teran dat night
this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplar sat the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corner sand an unshaded space in the centre where could be seen avery large solitary tree the nse vera lfr uit trees gnarled and bristling like bush es beds of vegetables am elon patch whose glass frame sspa rkl edin the moonlight and an old well
here and the rest ood stone bench es which seemed black with moss
the alley swer ebor dered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs
the grass had half taken possession of the man dag re en mould covered the rest
jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent api leo ffa got sand behind the fago tsd irect lya gains tthe wall aston esta tue whose mutilated face was nolonger anything more than a shapeless mask which loomed vaguely through the gloom
the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were distinguishable one of which much encumbered seemed to serve as a shed
the large building of the rue droit mur which had a wing on the rue petit pic pus turned two facades at right angles to ward sth is garden
the sein terior facades were even more tragic than the exterior
all the windows were grated
not a gleam of light was visible at any one of the m
the upper story had scuttles like prisons
one of those facades cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense black pall
no other house was visible
the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness
nevertheless walls could be confused lym ade out which intersect edas thought he re were more cultivated land beyond and the low roofs of the rue polo ncea u
nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined
the rewa sno one in it which was quite natural in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this spot were made for anyone to walk in even in broad daylight
jean valjean 's first care had been to get hold of his shoes and put the mona gain the nto step under the shed with cosette
aman who is fleeing never think shims elf sufficiently hidden
the child whose thoughts were still on the then a rdi ers hare dhis instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible
cosette trembl edan dpr esse dc lose to him
the yhe ard the tumultuous noise of the patrol search in gthe blind alley and the streets the blows of the irgun stock saga in stth est on esj avert 's appeal sto the police spies who mhe had posted and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished
atthe expiration of aqua rte rof an hour its eem edas thought hats pec ies of storm yro a rwe re becoming more distant
jean valjean held his breath
he had laid his hand lightly on cosette 's mouth
however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this frightful uproar close and furious as it was didnot disturb him by som uch as the shadow of a misgiving
it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak
all at once in the midst of this profound calm afresh sound arose as ound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been horrible
it was a hymn which is sued from the gloom ada zz ling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night women 's voice sbu tv oic escom posed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents of children voices which are not ofthe earth and which resemble those that the newborn infants till he ars and which the dying man hears already
this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which tower eda bovet he garden
atthe moment when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom
cosette and jean valjean fell on the irk nees
the yk new not what it was the yk new not where the yw ere but both of the mthe man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that the ym us tkn eel
the sev oic esha dth is strange characteristic that the ydi dno tpr event the building from seeming to be deserted
it was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house
while the sev oic es were singing jean valjean thought of nothing
he nolonger beheld the night he beheld a blue sky
it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding
the song died away
it may have lasted along time
jean valjean could not have to ld
hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment
all fell silent again
the rewa sno longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden
that which had menace dth at which had reassured him all had vanished
the breeze swayed afew dry weeds on the crest of the wall and the yg ave out a faint sweet melancholy sound
chapter vii continuation of the enigma the night wind had risen which indicated that it must be between one and two o'clock in the morning
poor cosette said nothing
as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep
he bent down and looked at her
cosette 's eyes were wide open and her thoughtful air pain ed jean valjean
she was still trembling
are you sleep y
said jean valjean
iam very cold she replied
amo men tla ters here sumed is she still there
who
said jean valjean
madame the nardi er
jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make cosette keeps ile nt
ah
said he she is gone
you need fear nothing further
the child sighed as though aload had been lifted from her breast
the ground was damp the shed open on all sides the breeze grew more keene very instant
the good man took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette
are you less cold now
said he
oh yes father
well wait for me a moment
iwill soon be back
he quit ted the ruin and crept along the large buildings eek in gabe tter shelter
he came across doors but the yw erec lose d
the re were bars at all the windows ofthe ground floor
just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived alight
he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of the sew in dows
the yallop ened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up by arcade sand pillars where only at in yli ght and great shadows were visible
the light came from a tape rw hich was burning in one corner
the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it
nevertheless by dint of gazing in tently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding sheet and which resembled a human form
this form was lying face down ward flat on the pavement with the arms extended in the form of across in the immobility of death
one would have said judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor that this sinister for mha dar oper ound its neck
the whole chamber was bathed in that mist of places which are spare ly illuminated which adds to horror
jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal spectre shad crossed his path in life he had never be held anything more blood curdling and terrible than that enigmatic al form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and beheld thus at night
it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive
he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move
inspite of his remaining thus what seemed to him avery longtime the outstretched for mma denom ove men t
all at once he felt himself overpowered by an inexpressible terror and he fled
he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him
it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that for mfo llow in ghi mwi th great strides and waving it sar ms
here ached the ruin all out of breath
his knees were giving way beneath him the perspiration was pouring from him
where was he
who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of paris
what was this strange house
an edifice full of nocturnal mystery calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels and when the yca me offering the mab rupt lyth at terrible vision promising to open the radiant portal so fhe avena ndt he nope ning the horrible gates of the tomb
and it actually was an edifice a house which bore an umber on the street
it was not a dream
he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact
cold anxiety uneasiness the emotions of the night had given him age nui nef ever and all the seide as were clashing together in his brain
he stepped up to cosette
she was asleep
chapter viii the enigma becomes doubly mysterious the child had laid her head on aston eand fallen asleep
he sat down beside her and began to think
little by little as he gazed at her hegre wca lma ndr egain edp oss ession of his freedom of mind
he clearly perceive dth is truth the foundation of his life henceforth that solon gas she was the reso long as he had her near him he should need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her
he was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his coat to cover her
nevertheless athwart this rever yin to which he had fallen he had heard for sometime apec uli arno is e
it was like the tinkling of abell
this sound proceeded from the garden
it could be heard distinctly though faintly
it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the past ures
this noise made valjean turn round
he looked and saw that the rewa sso me one in the garden
abe in gres embl in gama nwa swa lk in gami dthe bell glasses of the melon beds rising stooping halting with regular movements as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground
this person appeared to limp
jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy
for the mev ery thing is hostile and suspicious
the ydi str us tthe day because it enables people to see the man dthe night because it aids in surprising them
alittle while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted and now he shivered because the rewa sso me one there
he fell back from chimerical terror store alter rors
he said to himself that javert and the spies had perhaps not take nthe ird epa rtu retha tthe yha dno doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up
he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed
cosette did not stir
from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch
the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell followed each of this man 's movements
when the man approached the sound approach ed when the man retreated the sound retreated if he made any hasty gesture at remo loa ccom panied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased
it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify
who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or an ox
as he put the seq uestions to himself he touched cosette 's hands
the yw ere i cyco ld
ah
good god
he cried
he spoke to her in a low voice cosette
she did not open here yes
he shook her vigorously
she did not wake
is she dead
he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to foot
the most frightful thoughts rushed pell me llt hr ough his mind
the rear emo ments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of furies and violently for cet hepa rti tions of our brains
when those we love are in question our prudence in vents every sort of madness
here member edt hats lee pint he openair on a cold night maybe fatal
cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement
he listened to her breathing she still breathe dbu twit hares pirat ion which seemed to him weak and onthe point of extinction
how was he to warm her back to life
how was he toro use her
all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts
her us he dwi ldl yf rom the ruin
it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and beside a fire in less than a quarter of an hour
chapter ix the man with the bell he walked straight up to the man who mhe saw in the garden
he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat
the man 's head was bent down and he did not see him approaching
in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him
jean valjean accosted him with the cryo neh und red francs
the manga veas tartan drais ed his eyes
you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean ifyou will grant mesh elte rfor this night
the moon shone full upon jean valjean 's terrified countenance
what
so it is you father madeleine
said the man
that name thus pronounced at that obscure hour in that unknown spot by that strange man made jean valjean start back
he had expected anything but that
the person who thus addressed him was a bent and lame oldman dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his left knee alea the rk nee cap when ceh unga moderately large bell
his face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable
however the good man had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all over a hgo odg od
how come you here father madeleine
where did you enter
die uj esus
did you fall from heaven
the reis not rouble about that if every oud of all it will be from the re
and what asta tey oua rein
you have no cravat you have no hat you have no coat
do you know you would have frightened anyone who did not know you
no coat
lord god
are the saints going mad nowadays
but how did you get in here
his words tumbled over eachother
the good man talked with a rustic vol ubi lity in which the rewa snot hing alarming
all this was uttered with a mixture of stu pef action and naive kindliness
who are you
and what house is this
demanded jean valjean
ah
pardi eu this is to om uch
exclaimed the old man
iam the person for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had me place d
what
you do n't recognize me
no said jean valjean and how happens it that you know me
you save dmy life said the man
he turned
ara yof moonlight outlined his profile and jean valjean recognized old fau che le vent
ah
said jean valjean so it is you
yes i recollect you
that is very lucky said the old man in a reproach fulton e
and what are you doing here
resume dj ean valjean
why i am covering my melons ofcourse
infact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old fau che le vent held in his hand the end of astra wma twh ich he was occupied in spreading over the melon be d
during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out an umber of the m
it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean
he continued is a idt omy self ' the moon is bright it is going to freeze
what if i were to put my melons in to the irg re atco at s
' and head de dlo okin gat jean valjean with abroad smile pardi eu
you ought to have done the same
but how do you come here
jean valjean finding himself known to this man atleast only under the name of madeleine the nce for thad vance do nly with caution
he multiplied his questions
strange to say the irr oles seemed to be reversed
it was he the intruder who interrogated
and what is this bell which you wear on your knee
this replied fau che le vent is so that i may be avoided
what
so that you may be avoided
old fau che le vent winked with an indescribable air
ah goodness
the rear eon ly women in this house many young girls
it appears that is hould be a dangerous person to meet
the bell gives the mwa rning
when i come the ygo
what house is this
come you know well enough
but i do not
not when you got me the place here asgard ener
answer me as though i knew nothing
well then this is the petit pic pus convent
memories recurred to jean valjean
chance that is to say providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier saint antoine where old fau che le vent crippled by the fall from his car thad been admitted on his recommendation two years previously
here peated as though talking to himself the petit pic pus convent
exactly returned old fau che le vent
but to come to the point how the deuce did you manage to get in here you father madeleine
no matter if you are asain tyo uar eam an aswell and no man enters her e
you certainly are here

jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in agrave voice father fau che le vent is a ved your life
iwas the first to recall it returned fau che le vent
well you can do today for me that which i did for you in the old end ays
fau che le vent to okin his age dtr embl in gand wrinkled hands jean valjean 's two robust hands and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking
at length he exclaimed oh
that would be able ssi ngf rom the good god if i could make you some little return for that
save your life
monsieur le maire dispose of the old man
a wonderful joy had transfigured this oldman
his countenance seemed to emit a ray of light
what do you wish metodo
here sumed
that iwill explain to you
you have a chamber
ihave an isolated hovel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent in acorn erw hich noone ever look sin to
the rear eth re eroom sin it
the hut was in fact sowell hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived it
good said jean valjean
now i am going to ask two things of you
what are the ym r
mayor
in the first place you are not to tell anyone what you know about me
in the second you are not to try to find out anything more

wewill go and get the child
ah
said fau che le vent so there is a child
head de dno taw or dfu rthe rand followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master
less than half an hour afterwards cosette who had grown rosy again before the flame of ago odf ire was lying asleep in the old garden er 's bed
jean valjean had put on his cravat and coat once more his hat which he had flung over the wall had been found and picked up
while jean valjean was putting on his coat fau che le vent had removed the bell and kneecap which now hung on an ai lbe side avi nta geb ask et that adorned the wall
the two men were warming themselves with the ire lbo wsr esting on a table upon which fau che le vent had placed abit of cheese black bread abot tle of wine and two glasses and the old man was saying to jean valjean as he laid his hand on the latter 's knee a h

chapter x which explains how javert goto nthe scent the event so fw hich wehave just beheld the reverse side soto speak had come about inthe simple stp ossi blem anne r
when jean valjean on the evening of the very day when javert had arrested him beside fantin e 's death bed had escaped from the town jail of m
sur m
the police had supposed that he had beta ken himself to paris
paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost and everything disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea

the yso ugh tthe ex mayor of m
sur m
javert was summoned to paris to throw light on the irre search es
javert had infact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean
javert 's zealand intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by m
cha bou ill ets ecretary of the prefecture under comte angles
m
cha bou ill et who had more over already been javert 's patron had the inspector of m
sur m
attached to the police force of paris
the re javert rendered himself useful in divers and thought he word may seem strange for such services honorable man ners
he nolonger thought of jean valjean the wolf of today causes the sedo gsw hoare always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday when i nde cember here ada newspaper he who never read newspapers but javert amon arch ical man had a desire to know the particular soft he triumph alent ryo fthe prince general is simo into bayonne
just as he was finishing the article which interested him an amet he name of jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page
the paper announced that the convict jean valjean was dead and published the fact in such formal terms that javert did not doubt it
he confined himself to the remark that 's agood entry
the nhe threw a side the paper and thought no more about it
sometime after wards it chance dth at a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of the seine et oise to the prefecture of police in paris concerning the abduction of a child which had taken place under peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of mont ferme il
alittle girl of seven or eight years of age there ports aid who had been intrusted by her mother to an innkeeper of that neighborhood had been stolen by astra nger this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named fantin ewh ohad died in the hospital it was not know nw here or when
this report came under javert 's eye and set him to thinking
the name of fantin ewa swell known to him
here member edt hatje an valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by asking him for a respite of three days for the purpose of going to fetch that creature 's child
here called the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for mont ferme il
some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for he had not been seen in the village itself
what had he been intending to do in that region of mont ferme il
it could not even be surmised
javert understood it now
fantin e 's daughter was the re
jean valjean was going there in search of her
and now this child had been stolen by astra nger
who could that strange rbe
could it be jean valjean
but jean valjean was dead
javert without saying anything to anybody to okt he coach from the pewter platter cul de sac de la plan chet tea ndma deat ripto mon tfe rme il
he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found agreat deal of obscurity
for the first few days the then a rdi ers had chattered in the irr age
the disappearance of the lark had created as ens ation in the village
he immediately obtained numerous version soft he story which ended in the abduction of a child
hence the police report
but the irf irst vexation having passed off the nardi erw it hhi sw onder ful in sti nc thad very quickly comprehended that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaint swith regard to the abduction of cosette would have a sthe irf irst result to fix upon himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering eye of justice
the last thing that owls desire is to have a candle brought to the m
and in the first place how explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received
he turned square lyr ound put a gag on his wife 's mouth and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was mentioned to him
he understood nothing about it no doubt he had grumbled for awhile at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness but he rgr and father had come for her in the most natural way in the world
head de dthe grandfather which produced a good effect
this was the story that javert hit upon when he arrived at mont ferme il
the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish
nevertheless javert dropped a few questions like plummets into the nardi er 's history
who was that grandfather
and what was his name
the nardi err epl ie dwi ths implicit yhe is a wealth yf armer
is a whi spass port
it hink his name was m
guillaume lambert
lambert is a respectable and extremely reassuring name
the re upon javert returned to paris
jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am an in ny
he had again begun to forget this history when i nthe course of march hehe ardo fas in gular person age who dwelt in the parish of saint medard and who had been surname dthe mendicant who gives a lms
this person the story ran was a man of means whose name noone knew exactly and who lived alone with alittle girl of eight years who knew nothing about herself save that she had come from mont ferme il
mon tfe rme il
that name was always coming up and it made javert prick up his ears
an old beggar police spy an ex beadle to whom this person had given a lms added a few more details
this gentleman of property was very shy never coming out except in the evening speaking to noon eex cept occasionally to the poor and never allowing anyone to approach him
he wore a horrible old yellow frock coat which was worth many millions being all wadded with bank bills
this piqued javert 's curiosity in a decided manner
inorder to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman with out alarming him he borrowed the beadle 's outfit for a day and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening whining orisons through his nose and playing the spy undercover of prayer
the suspected individual did indeed approach javert thus disguised and best owa lms on him
at that moment javert raised his head and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received by javert when he thought he recognized jean valjean
however the darkness might have misled him jean valjean 's death was official javert cherished very grave doubts and when i nd ou bt javert the man of scruples never laid afin gerona nyon e 's collar
he followed his man to the go rbe a uh ouse and got the old woman total king which was no difficult matter
the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the coat line dwi thm illion sand narrated to him the episode of the thousand franc bill
she had seen it
she had handled it
javert hired a room that evening he installed himself in it
he came and listened at the mysterious lodge r 's door hoping to catch the sound of his voice but jean valjean saw his candle through the keyhole and foiled the spy by keeping silent
onthe following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the fall of the five franc piece was not iced by the old woman who hearing the rattling of coins us pected that he might be intending to leave and made haste to warn javert
at night when jean valjean came out javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men
javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not mentioned the name of the individual who mhe hope dto seize that was his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next because to lay hands on an ex convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead on a criminal who mju stice had formerly class edf or ever as among malefactors of the most dangerous sort was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to an ew come rli ke javert and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict and lastly because javert being an artist had a taste for the unforeseen
he hated those well heralded success es which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off
he preferred to elaborate his masterpiece sin the dark and to unveil the msu dde nly at the last
javert had followed jean valjean from tree to tree the nfr omc or ner to corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a single instant even at the moment sw he nj ean valjean believe dhi msel ft obe the most secure javert 's eye had been on him
why had not javert arrested jean valjean
because he was still in doubt
it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease the free press embarrassed its ever ala rbi trary arrests denounced by the newspaper shade choe dev enas far as the chamber sand had rendered the prefecture timid
interference with individual liberty was a grave matter
the police agents were afraid of making a mistake the prefect laid the blame on the mami stake meant dismissal
the reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph reproduced by twenty newspapers would have caused in paris yesterday an aged grandfather with white hair are spec table and well to do gentleman who was walking with his grandchild aged eight was arrested and conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escape dc on vic t
let us repeat inaddition that javert had scruples of his own injunction so fhi scons cience were added to the injunction soft he prefect
he was really in doubt
jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark
sadness uneasiness anxiety depression this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night to see kach an cere fuge in paris for cosette and himself the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child all this without his being aware of it had altered jean valjean 's walk and impressed on his bearings uch senility that the police themselves in car nate in the person of javert might and did in fact make a mistake
the impossibility of approaching to ocl ose his costume of an emigre preceptor the declaration of the nardi erw hich made a grandfather of him and finally the belief in his death in prison added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in javert 's mind
for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not ago odh one stol dfe llow living on his income he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunning ly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds some chief of a dangerous band who gave a lms to conceal his other talents which was an old dodge
he had trust yf ellow sacco mpl ice s 're treats in case of emergencies in which he would no doubt take refuge
all the set urns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not as imple and honest man
to arrest him to oha stil yw ould be to kill the hen that laid the golden eggs
where was the inconvenience in waiting
javert was very sure that he would not escape
thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatic alpers on a ge
it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a dram shop hed eci de dly recognized jean valjean
the rear ein this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recover she rch il dan dthe tiger whore covers his prey
javert gave that profound start
as soon as he had positive lyre cogni zed jean valjean the formidable convict he perceived that the re were only three of the man dheas ked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise
one puts on gloves before grasping at horn cudgel
this delay and the halt at the carrefour rollin to consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail
he speedily divine dhow ever that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself
he bent his head and reflected like a bloodhound who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the right scent
javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to the bridge of austerlitz
a word with the toll keeper furnished him with the information which he required have you see naman with alittle girl
imad ehi mpa yt wos ous replied the toll keeper
javert reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by the hand
he saw him enter the rue du chemin verts ain tanto in eher eme mber edt he cul de sac gen rota rra nge dthe reli keat rap and ofthe sole exit of the rue droit muri ntot her uep et it pic pus
he made sure of his back burrows as huntsmen say he has til yd espa tche done of his agents by around about way to guard that is sue
apa trol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made are quis it ion on it and caused it to accompany him
in such games soldiers are aces
moreover the principle is that inorder to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the science of vene ryan dpl ent yof dogs
the sec omb ination shaving been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley gen roto nthe right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff
the nhe began the game
he experienced one ecstatic and infernal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but desirous of postponing the moment of arrest as long as possible happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter and ofthe cat which lets the mouse run
claws and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in the irp in cers
what adel ight this strangling is
javert was enjoying himself
the meshes of his net were stoutly knotted
he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand
accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible however vigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be
illustration javert on the hunt bja verto nthe hunt javert advanced slowly sounding search in gon his way all the nooks of the street like soma ny pocket soft hi eves
when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly nolonger the re
his exasperation can be imagined
he interrogated his sentinel of the rue sdr oit mura ndp et it pic pus that agent who had remained imper turba bly at his post had not seen the man pass
it sometimes happens that as tag is lost head and horns that is to say he escapes although he has the pack on his very heels and the nth eol dest huntsmen known otw hat to say
duvivier lig niv ill eand desprez halts hort
in a discomfiture of this sort art on gee xcl aims it was not as tag but as orce re r
javert would have liked to utter the same cry
his disappointment bordered for a moment on despair and rage
it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was a tfa ulti nthe war in scythia and that javert blundered in this campaign against jean valjean
he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the exco nvi ct
the first glance should have sufficed him
he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong in not arresting him when he positive lyre cogni zed him in the rue de pontoise
he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin
advice is certainly useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence but the hunter can not be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict
javert by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhound soft hepa cko nthe trail alarmed the beast by giving him wind of the dart and so made him run
above all he was wrong in that after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread
he thought himself stronger than he was an dbe lieved that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion
atthe sametime here cko ned himself as to owe a kwh en he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement
fatal precaution waste of precious time
javert committed all the sebl under sand nonetheless was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed
he was in the full force of the term what is called in vene rya knowing dog
but what is the retha tis perfect

the greatest follies are often composed like the largest ropes of a multitude of strands

however that maybe even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him javert did not lose his head
sure that the convict who had broken his banco uld not be far off he established sentinel she organized traps and ambu scad esa ndb eat the quarter all that night
the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose rope had been cut

in this blind alley the re were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds adjoined the immense stretches of wasteland

lepe tit pic pusch apter in umber rue petit pic pus nothing half a century ago more resembled every other carriage gate than the carriage gate of number rue petit pic pus
this entrance which usually stood a jar in the most inviting fashion permitted aview of two things neither of which have anything very funereal about the mac our tya rds urr ound ed by walls hung with vines and the face of a lounging porter
above the wall at the bottom of the court tall trees were visible
when a ray of sunlight enlivened the courtyard when a glass of wine cheered up the porter it was difficult to pass number little pic pusst re et without carrying away as mili ngi mpre ssion of it
nevertheless it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse
the threshold smiled the house prayed and we pt
if one succeeded in passing the porter which was not easy which was even nearly impossible for everyone for the rewa san open sesame
which it was necessary to know if the porter once passed on een tered alittle vestibule on the right on which opened as tair cases hut inbetween two walls and sonar row that only one person could ascend it at a time if one did not allow one 's self to be alarmed by a daub in gof canary yellow with a dad oof chocolate which clothed this staircase if one venture dto ascend it on ecr oss eda first landing the nas econ dandar rived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow was hand the chocolate hued plinth pursued one with a peaceable persistency
staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows
the corridor to oka turn and became dark
if one double dth is cape one arrived afew pace sfu rthe ronin front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened
if one opened it on efo undone 's self in alittle chamber about six feet square tiled well scrubbed clean cold and hung with nankin paper with green flowers at fifteen sous the roll
a white dull light fell from a large window with tiny panes on the left which usurped the whole width of the room
one gazed about but saw no one onelist ened one heard neither afoot step norah uman murmur
the walls were bare the chamber was not furnished the rewa snot even a chair
onelook eda gain and beheld on the wall facing the door aqua drang ular hole about afoot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars black knotted solid which formed square sih ada lmos tsai dme she so fl ess than an inch and a half india gonal length
the little green flowers of the nankin paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars without being start led or thrown into confusion by the irf une real contact
supposing that ali ving being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance or an exit through the square hole this grating would have prevented it
it did not allow the passage of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to say ofthe mind
this seems to have occurred to the mfor it had been re enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall alittle in the rear and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of astra in er
atthe bottom of this plate an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letter box
abit of tape attached to abell wire hung at the right of the grated opening
if the tape was pulled abell rangan done heard a voice very near athan dwh ich made on estar t
whois the re
the voice demanded
it was a woman 's voice agent levo ice so gentle that it was mournful
here again there was a magical word which it was necessary to know
if one did not know it the voice ceased the wall became silent on cem or east hough the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it
if one knew the password the voice resume dente ron the right
one then perceived on the right facing the window agl as sdo or surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray
on raising the latch and crossing the threshold one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters a tthe the atr ein to agra ted baignoire before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted
one was in fact in a sort of the atr ebox narrow furnished with two old chairs and am uch frayed straw matting spare ly illuminated by the vague light from the glass door are gular box with its front just of a height to lean upon bearing at able to fbla ck wood
this box was grated only the grating of it was not of gilded wood as a tthe opera it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastening sw hich resembled clenched fist s
the first minute spass ed when one 's eyes began to grow used to this cellar like half twilight one tried to pass the grating but got no further than six inches beyond it
the re he encountered a barrier of black shutters re enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted aging erb ready ellow
the ses hutter swer edi vided into long narrow slats and the yma sked the entire length of the grating
the yw ere always closed
atthe expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind the ses hutter sands ayin gia mhe re
what do you wish with me
it was a beloved sometimes an adored voice
noone was visible
hardly the sound of a breath was audible
it seemed as though it were as piri twh ich had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb
if one chance dto be within certain prescribed and very rare condition sthe slat of one of the shutter so pened opposite you the evoked spirit became a nappa rit ion
behind the grating behind the shutter one perceived sofa rast he grating permitted sight ahead of which only the mouth and the chin were visible there st was covered with a black veil
one caught a glimpse of a black gui mpe and a form that was barely defined covered with a black shroud
that he ads poke with you but did not look at you and never smile dat you
the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black
this light was symbolic al
nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that places hut of ffr oma llg lance s
apr of ound vagueness envelope dth at form clad in mourning
your eyes search edt hat vagueness and sought to make out the surrounding soft heap pari tion
atthe expiration of avery short time you discovered that you could see nothing
what you beheld was night emptiness shadows awi ntry mist mingled with a vapor from the tomb as orto fter rib lepe ace as i lence from which you could gather nothing not even sighs a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing not even phantom s
what you beheld was the interior of a cloister
it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernardine soft he perpetual adoration
the box in which you stood was the parlor
the first voice which had addressed you was that of the port res sw hoa lwa yss at motionless and silent on the other side of the wall near the square opening screen ed by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes as by a double visor
the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor which had a window on the side of the world had no neon the side of the convent
profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place
nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow the rewa sali ght the rewa sli feint he midst of that death
although this was the most strictly walled of all convent swes hall endeavor to make our way into it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the proper bounds things which storytellers have never seen and have therefore never described

we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader 's mind
about this time there was in the convent am yst eri ous person who was not an un who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine
nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead
beneath this history itwas said the relay the arrangements of fortune necessary for agreat marriage

wherever she entered people felt cold
one day as is tero nse ein ghe rpa sssa id to another sister she passes for a dead woman
perhaps she is one replied the other
ah und red tales were told of madame albertine
this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils
in the chapel there was a gallery called l' oeil de boeuf
it was in this gallery which had only a circular bayan oeil de boeuf that madame albertine listened to the office s
she always occupied it alone because from this gallery being on the level of the first story the preacher or the officiating priest could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns
one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank m

not one of the young recluse sco uld see him because of the serge curtain but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice which the yha dcom et ok now and to distinguish

the convent was composed of several buildings and agard en
the principal building taken in its entirety was a juxtaposition of hybrid construction sw hich viewed from a bird's eye view outlined with considerable exactness a gibbet laid flat on the ground
the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the rue droit mur comprised between the rue petit pic pusan dthe rue polo ncea uthe lesser arm was a lofty gray severe grated facade which faced the rue petit pic pus the carriage entrance no
marked its extremity
towards the centre of this facade was a low arched door white ned with dust and ashes where the spiders wove the ir web sandwhich was open only for an hour or two on sunday sand on rare occasions when the coffin of an un left the convent
this was the public entrance of the church
the elbow of the gibbet was a square hall which was used as the servants ' hall and which the nuns called the butter y
in the main arm were the cells of the mother sthe sisters and the novice s
in the lesser arm lay the kitchen sthe refectory back edu pby the cloisters and the church

the remainder of the trapezium for me dthe garden which was much lower than the level of the rue polo ncea uw hich caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside

in the little convent the rewa sace nte nari an who came from the abbey of font evra ult
she had even been in society before the revolution
she talked agreat deal of m

and of apres ident ess dupla twit hwh oms he had been very intimate
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in the sena meson every pretext
she told wonders of the abbey of font evra ult that it was like a city and that the re were street sin them on aster y
she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and atthe moment of taking the oaths he said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius etc
etc

she said that in her youth the bernardine monks were ever yw hit as good as the mous que tair es
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
she told about the custom of the four wines which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne
when agreat person age amar shal of france apr in cea duke and a peer traverse dato wn in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which the yha dpo ured four different sorts of wine
onthe first goblet this inscription could be read monkey wine on the second lion wine on the third sheep wine on the fourth hog wine
the sef our legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard the first intoxication which enlivens the second that which irritates the third that which dull sand the fourth that which brutalize s
in a cupboard under lock and keys he kept a mysterious object of which she thought agreat deal
the rule of font evra ult did not forbid this
she would not show this object to anyone
she shut herself up which he rrule allowed her to do and hid her self everytime that she desired to contemplate it
if she heard afoot step in the corridors he closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her age dhan ds
as soon as it was mentioned to her she became silent she who was so fond of talking
the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy
thus it furnished as ub ject of comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent
what could that treasure of the cente nari an be which was so precious and so secret
some holy book nod ou bt
some unique chaplet
some authentic relic

when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps an dope nedit

one of the charming little love sisal ready fairly spit ted

this platter which is very curious and which had possibly the honor of furnishing moliere with an idea was still in existence in september itwas for sale by a bric a brac merchant in the boulevard beaumarchais
this good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because said she the parlor is to ogl oom y
chapter xor igi no fthe perpetual adoration however this almost sepulchral parlor of which we have sought to convey an idea is a purely local trait which is not reproduce dwi tht he same severity in other convent s
atthe convent of the rue du temple in particular which belonged in truth to another order the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor whose windows were draped in white muslin curtains and whose walls admitted allsorts of frames apo rtr aito fab ened ict in enu nwi thu nve ile d face painted bouquets and even the head of a turk

this order of the perpetual adoration is not very ancient and does not goback more than two hundred years
in the holy sacrament was profane dont woo ccas ions afew days apart in two churches in paris at saint sulpice and at saint jean engr eve arar eand frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar

but this expiation did not satisfy two saint ed women madame court in marquise de bou csa ndt he comtesse de chateau vieux
this outrage committed on the most holy sacrament of the altar though but temporary would not depart from the seh oly souls and its eem edt othe mth at it could only be exten uated by a perpetual adoration in some female monastery

after the abbe of saint germain the king accorded letters patent and all the rest abba tial charter and royal letters was confirmed in bythe chamber of accounts and the parliament
such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the benedictine soft he perpetual adoration of the holy sacrament at paris
the irf irst convent was an ew building in the rue cassette out of the contributions of mesdames de bou csa nd dec hate au vieux
this order as it will be seen was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of cite a ux
it mounted back to the abbe of saint germain des pres in the same manner that the ladies of the sacred heart goback to the general of the jesuits and the sisters of charity to the general of the lazar is ts
it was also totally different from the bernardine soft he petit pic pus whose interior wehave just shown
in pope alexander vi i
had authorized by a special brief the bernardine soft her uep et it pic pus to practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictine nuns of the holy sacrament
but the two orders remained distinct nonetheless
chapter xi end of the petit pic pusat the beginning of the restoration the convent of the petit pic pus was in its decay this form sapa rto fthe general death of the order which after the eighteenth century has been disappearing like all the religious orders
contemplation is like prayer one of humanity 's needs but like everything which the revolution touched it will be transformed and from being hostile to social progress it will be come favorable to it
the house of the petit pic pus was becoming rapidly depopulated
in the little convent had disappeared the school had disappeared

because it would come to this the plant will sthe ref or eith as an it heun ivers ewi lls therefore it has a god
as for us who however in contradistinction to this school reject nothing apriori a will inthe plant accepted by this school appears to us more difficult to admit than a will inthe universe denied by it
to deny the will ofthe infinite that is to say god is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite
wehave demonstrated this
the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism
everything becomes a mental conception
with nihilism no discussion is possible for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor and is not quite sure that it exists itself
from its point of view it is possible that it may be for itself only amenta lco ncep tion

it is necessary that the ideal should be breathable drinkable and eatable to the human mind
it is the ideal which has the right to say take this
it is on this condition that it ceases to be aster ile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion
philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at its ease with out anyother result than that of being convenient to curiosity

book eighth
cemeteries take that which is committed the mcha pter i which treats of the manner of entering a convent it was into this house that jean valjean had a sfa uchel event expressed it fallen from the sky
he had scale dthe wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue polo ncea u
that hymn of the angels which he had heard in the middle of the night was the nuns chanting matins that hall of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom was the chapel
that phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation that bell the sound of which had so strangely surprised him was the garden er 's bella tta che dto the knee of father fau che le vent
cosette once put to be dj ean valjean and fau che le vent had a swe have already seen supped on a glass of wine and abit of cheese before ago odc rack ling fire the nth eon ly be dint he hut being occupied by cosette each threw himself on a truss of straw
before he shut his eyes jean valjean said imus tremain here henceforth
this remark trotted through fau che le vent 's head all night long
to tell the truth neither of the msl ept
jean valjean feeling that he was discovered and that javert was on his scent understood that he and cosette were lost if the yr et urn edt opar is
the nth enews to rm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister
jean valjean had henceforth but one thought to remain the re
now for an unfortunate man in his position this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places the most dangerous because as nomen might enter the reif hewer edis covered it was a flagrant offence and jean valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison the safest because i fhe could manage to get himself accepted the rea ndr emai nthe re who would ever see khim in such a place
to dwell in an impossible place was safety
on his side fau che le vent was cudgel ling his brain s
he began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter
how had m
madeleine got the re when the walls were what they were
cloister walls are not to be stepped over
how did he get the re with a child
one can not scale aper pen dic ular wall with a child in one 's arms
who was that child
where did the yb oth come from
since fau che le vent had lived in the convent he had heard nothing of m
sur m
and he knew nothing of what had taken place the re
father madeleine had an air which discouraged questions and besides fau che le vent said to himself on edo esn ot question as a int
m
madeleine had preserved all his prestige in fau che le vent 's eyes
only from some words which jean valjean had let fall the garden erth ought he could draw the inference that m
madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard time sand that he was pursued by his creditors or that he had compromised himself in some political affair and was in hiding which last didnot displease fau che le vent who like many of our peasants of the north had an old fund of bona part is mabou thi m
while in hiding m
madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain the re
but the inexplicable point to which fau che le vent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain was that m
madeleine should be the rea ndt hath esh ould have that little girl with him
fau che le vent saw the mto uche dthe msp ok et othe man dst ill did not believe it possible
the incomprehensible had just made it sent rance into fau che le vent 's hut
fau che le vent groped about amid conjecture sand could see nothing clearly but this m
madeleine save dmy life
this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course
he said to himself itis my turn now
head de dinh is conscience m
madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the car tfor the purpose of dragging me out
he made up his mind to save m
madeleine
nevertheless he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies after what he did for me would isa vehi mi fhe were at hie f
just the same
if he were an assassin would isa vehi m
just the same
since he is a saint shall is a vehi m
just the same
but what apr obl emit was to manage to have him remain in the convent
fau che le vent did not recoil in the face of this almost chimerical undertaking this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his self devotion his goodwill and alittle of that old rustic cunning on this occasion enlisted in the service of age nero use nterprise undertook to scale the difficulties of the cloister and the steep escarpment soft her ule of saint benoit
father fau che le vent was an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who towards the end of his days halt in firm with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grateful and perceiving a generous action to be performed flung himself upon it like a man who atthe moment when he is dying should find close to his hand agl as so fg ood wine which he had never tasted and should swallow it with a vidi ty
we may add that the air which he had breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personal it yin him and had ended by rendering ago odac tion of some kind absolutely necessary to him
so he took his resolve to devote himself to m
madeleine
wehave just called him a poor peasant of picardy
that description is just but incomplete
atthe point of this story which we have no wre ached alittle of father fau che le vent 's physiology becomes useful
he was a peasant but he had been an otar yw hich added trickery to his cunning and penetration to his ingenuous ness
having through various causes failed in his business heh add esc ended tothe calling of a carter and alab or er
but in spite of oaths and lashing sw hich horses see mtor equi res ome thing of the notary had lingered in him
he had some natural with etalk edg ood grammar he converse dwh ichi sara re thing in avilla gea ndt he other peasants said of him he talks almost like agent leman with a hat
fau che le vent belonged in fact to that species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi bourgeois demi lout and which the metaphor ssh ower ed by the chateau upon the thatched cottage ticket edin the pigeonhole of the plebeian rather rustic rather citi fied pepper and salt
fau che le vent though sorely tried and harshly used by fate worn out as orto fpo or threadbare old soul was nevertheless an impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions apr eci ous quality which prevents one from ever being wicked
his defects and his vice sfor he had some were all superficial in short his physiognomy was ofthe kind which succeeds with an observer
his age dfa ceh a dno neo ft hose disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify malice or stupidity
at daybreak father fau che le vent opened his eyes after having done an enormous deal of thinking and beheld m
madeleine seated on his truss of straw and watching cosette 's slumber s
fau che le vent sat up and said no wth a tyo uar eher ehow are you going to contrive to enter
this remarks umm edu pthe situation and aroused jean valjean from his rever y
the two men took counsel together
in the first place said fau che le vent you will be gin by not setting foot outside of this chamber either you or the child
one step in the garden and wear edon efor
that is true
monsieur madeleine resume dfa uchel event you have arrived at avery auspicious moment i mean to say avery inauspicious moment one of the ladies is very ill
this will prevent the mfr oml ooking much in our direction
it seems that she is dying
the prayers of the forty hours are being said
the whole community is in confusion
that occupies the m
the one who is on the point of departure is a saint
infact wear eal lsa in tsh ere all the difference between the man dme is that the ysa y ' our cell ' and that is a y 'm yca bin
' the prayers for the dying are to be said and the nth epr ayers for the dead
we shall be at peace here for today but i will not answer for tomorrow
still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the wall itis hidden by a sort of ruin the rear etree siti snot visible from the convent
and i add that the nuns never come near it
well
said jean valjean
the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified its eem sto meth at one may remain concealed here
it was to this interrogation point that fau che le vent responded there are the little girls
what little girls
asked jean valjean
just as fau che le vent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered a belle mitted one stroke
the nun is dead said he
the reis the knell
and he made as i gnt oj ean valjean to listen
the bells truck as econ dti me
it is the knell monsieur madeleine
the bell will continue to strike on cea minute for twenty four hours until the body is taken from the church
you see the yp lay
at recreation hours its uffi cest oh ave aba llr olla side to send them all hither inspite of prohibition sto hunt and rummage for it all about her e

asked jean valjean
the little girls
you would be very quickly discovered
the yw ould shriek ' oh

' the reis no danger to day
the re will be no recreation hour
the day will be entirely devoted to prayer s
you hear the bell
as it old you astro kee ach minute
it is the death knell
i understand father fau che le vent
the rear epu pils
and jean valjean thought to himself here is cosette 's educational ready provided
fau che le vent exclaimed pardi ne
the rear elit tle girls in deed
and the yw ould bawl around you
and the yw ould rush of f
to be a man here is to have the plague
you see how they fast en abell to my paw as though i were a wild beast
jean valjean fell into more and more profound thought
this convent would be our salvation he murmured
the nhe raised his voice yes the difficulty is to remain here
no said fau che le vent the difficulty is to get out
jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart
to get out
yes monsieur madeleine
inorder to return here it is first necessary to get out
and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded fau che le vent went on you must not be found here in this fashion
when cecom eyo u
for me you fall from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to enter bythe door
all at once the yhe ardara the rco mpl icat edp ealing from another bell
ah
said fau che le vent the yare ringing up the vocal mother s
the yare going to the chapter
the yal ways hold a chapter when anyone dies
she died at daybreak
people generally do die at daybreak
but can not you get out by the way in which you entered
come id on ota skf or the sake of questioning you but how did you get in
jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder
you make your way out of afore st filled with tigers and once out of it imagine a friend lyco uns elt hats hall advise you to return thither
jean valjean picture dto himself the whole police force still engaged in swarming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinel sever yw here frightful fists extended to ward shi sco lla rja vert at the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps
impossible
said he
father fau che le vent say that if ell from the sky
but i believe it ibe lieve it retorted fau che le vent
you have no need to tell me that
the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and the ndr opp ed you
only heme an tto place you in a man 's convent he made a mistake
come there goes another peal that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead doctor is to come here and view acorp se

how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time
what is the matter

she is your daughter
you are her grandfather that is
yes
it will be easy enough for her to get out of her e
ihave my service door which opens on the courtyard
i knock
the porter open sih ave my vintage basket on my back the child is in it igo out
father fau che le vent goes out with his basket that is perfectly natural

but how will you manage to get out
jean valjean shook his head
noone must see me the whole point lies the ref at her fau che le vent
find some means of getting me out in a basket undercover like cosette
fau che le vent scratched the lobe of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand as i gno fse rious embarrassment
at hird peal created a diversion
that is the dead doctor taking his departure said fau che le vent
he has taken a look and said 's heis dead that is well
' when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise the undertaker 's company sends a coffin

aho riz on tal ray of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light
jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her
he was nolonger listening to fau che le vent
that one is not listened to isn or eason for preserving silence
the good old garden erw ent on tranquil ly with his babble the grave is dug in the va ugi rard cemetery
the yd ecl are that the yare going to suppress that vau girard cemetery
it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire
it is a shame for it is convenient
ihave afri end there father mest ie nne the gravedigger
the nuns here possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at night fall
the reis as pecial permission from the prefecture on the irb eha lf
but how many events have happened since yesterday
mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly
fau che le vent caught the word
goodness
if you were here for good it would be area lb uri al
a fourth peal burst out
fau che le vent hastily detached the bell ed kneecap from its nail and buckled it on his knee again
this time it is for me
the mother prior ess want sme
good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle
monsieur madeleine don'ts tir from here and wait for me
something new has come up
if you are hungry the reis wine bread and cheese
and he has ten edo uto fthe hut crying coming
coming
jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting aside long glance bythe way on his melon patch
less than ten minutes later father fau che le vent whose bell put the nuns in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and agent levo ice replied forever
forever
that is to say enter
the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the garden eron business
this parlor adjoined the chapter hall
the prior ess seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for fau che le vent
chapter ii fau che le vent in the presence of a difficult yit is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuns to wear a grave and agitated air on critical occasions
atthe moment when fau che le vent entered this double for mof preoccupation was imprinted on the countenance of the prior ess who was that wise and charming mademoiselle de blem eur mother innocent ewh owa so rd inari lychee rfu l
the garden erma deat imi dbo wand remained at the door of the cell
the prior ess who was telling her beads raised here yes and said a h
it is you father fauve nt
this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent
fau che le vent bowed again
father fauve nti have sent for you
here iam reverend mother
ihave something to say to you
and so have is a idfa uchel event with a boldness which caused him in ward terror ihave something to say to the very reverend mother
the prior ess stared at him
ah
you have a communication to make to me
are quest
very well speak
goodman fau che le vent the ex not a ry belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance
acer tain clever ignorance constitutes a force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it
fau che le vent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent
always solitary and busied about his gardening he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity
as he was a tad is tance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before him only an agitation of shadows
by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantom swith flesh and those corpses were alive for him
he was like a deaf man who ses ight grows keener and like a blind man who sehe arin gb ecom esm or eacute
he had applied himself to rid dling out the significance of the different peals and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatic al cloister possessed no secret sfor him the sphinx babble dall her secret sinh is ear
fau che le vent knew all and concealed all that constitute dhis art
the whole convent thought him stupid
agreat merit in religion
the vocal mother smad emu cho ffa uchel event
he was a curious mute
he inspired confidence
moreover he was regular and never went out except for well demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden
this discretion of conduct had in ured to his credit
nonetheless he had set two men to chattering the porter in the convent and he knew the singularities of the irpa rlo rand the gravedigger at the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of the irs e pul ture in this way he possessed a double light on the subject of the sen uns one as to the irl if ethe other as to the ird eat h
but he did not abuse his knowledge
the congregation thought agreat deal of him
old lame blind to everything probably alittle deaf into the bargain what qualities
the yw ould have found it difficult to replace him
the good man with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prior ess
he talked along time about his age his infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demand so fhi sw or kof the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had been obliged to put straw mats over the melon beds because of the moon and he wound up as follows that he had a brother the prior ess made a movement abr other nolonger young as econ dmove menton the part of the prior essb uto nee xpress ive of reassurance that if he might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help him that he was an excellent garden erth at the community would receive from him good service better than his own that otherwise if his brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged great lyt oh is regret to go away and that his brother had a little daughter who mhe would bring with him who might be reared for god in the house and who might who knows become an un someday
when he had finished speaking the prior ess stayed the slipping of her rosary between her fingers and said to him could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening
for what purpose
to serve as a lever
yes reverend mother replied fau che le vent
the prior ess without adding a word rose and entered the adjoining room which was the hall of the chapter and where the vocal mother swer epr oba bly assembled
fau che le vent was left alone
chapter iii mother innocent eab out aqua rte rof an hour elapsed
the prior ess returned and seated herself once more on her chair
the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied
wewill present as ten ogr a phic report of the dialogue which the nen sued to the best of our ability

that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door

yes reverend mother
when the vault is open iwill close it again
but before that what reverend mother
something must be lowered into it
as i lence ensued
the prior essa fter apo uto fthe under lip which resembled hesitation broke it
father fauve nt
reverend mother
you know that a mother died this morning
no
did you not hear the bell
nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden
really
ican hardly distinguish my own signal
she died at daybreak
and the nth ewin dis not blowing in my direction this morning
it was mother crucifixion

the mother shave taken her to the dead room which opens on the church

' at that moment nine o'clock struck
at nine o'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored beth emos tho lys a cram ent of the altar said the prior ess

it is probable that had it not been for this the prior essa ndf auch eleven two uld never have unravelled that skein

but without attaining to such happiness mother crucifixion 's death was very precious
she retained her consciousness to the very last moment
she spoke to us the nsh esp ok et othe angels
she gave us her last command s
if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it
she smiled
we felt that she was regaining her life in god

fau che le vent thought that it was an orison which she was finishing

she went on ihave consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy the mse lve sin the exercise soft he clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden
besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint
like yourself reverend mother
she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii
the one who crowned the emp buona part e

chapter iv in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castille jot he strides of a lame man are like the ogling glance sofa one eyed man they do not reach the irg oal very promptly
moreover fau che le vent was in a dilemma
he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden
cosette had wake dup
jean valjean had placed her near the fire
atthe moment when fau che le vent entered jean valjean was pointing out to her the vintner 's basket onthe wall and saying to her listen attentively to me my little cosette
we must go away from this house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here
the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that
you will wait for meat ala d y 's house
is hall come to fetch you
obey and say nothing above all things unless you want madame the nardi ert oge tyo uag ain
cosette nodded gravely
jean valjean turned round at the noise made by fa uchel event opening the door
well
everything is arranged and nothing is said fau che le vent
ihave permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be goto ut
that 's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child
you will carry her out
and she will hold her tongue
ian swer for that
but you father madeleine
and after a silence fraught with anxiety fau che le vent exclaimed why get out as you came in
jean valjean asin the first instance content ed himself with saying impossible
fau che le vent grumbled more to himself than to jean valjean the reis another thing which both ers me
ihave said that iwould put earth in it
when i come to think it over the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing it won ' tdo it will get displaced it will move about
the men will be a rit
you understand father madeleine the government will not ice it
jean valjean stared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
fau che le vent went on how the deuce are you going to get out
it must all be done by tomorrow morning
it is tomorrow that i am to bring you in
the prior essex pects you
the nhe explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which he fau che le vent was to render to the community
that it fell among his duties to take part in the irb uri als that he nailed up the coffin sand helped the gravedigger at the cemetery
that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
that the police regulations for bad eth is but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused
that the prior essa ndt he vocal mother sin tended to fulfil the wish ofthe deceased
that it was so much the worse for the government
that he fau che le vent was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
and that byway of thanks the prior ess was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil
that his brother was m
madeleine and that his niece was cosette
that the prior ess had to ldh imt obr in ghi sbr other onthe following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery
but that he could not bring m
madeleine in from the outside if m
madeleine was not outside
that that was the first problem
and the nth at the rewa san other the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin
asked jean valjean
fau che le vent replied the coffin of the administration
what coffin
what administration
an undies
the municipal doctor comes and says ' an un has died
' the government send saco ffi n
the next day it sends a hearse and undertake r 's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery
the undertaker 's men will come and lift the coffin the re will be nothing in it
put something in it
acorp se
ihave none
no
what the n
ali ving person
what person
me
said jean valjean
fau che le vent who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair
you
why not
jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter
you know fau che le vent what you have said 'm other crucifixion is dead
' and i add ' and father madeleine is buried
' ah
good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously
very seriously imus tge to uto ft his place
certainly
lha veto ldy out of indaba ske tanda cover for meals o
well
the basket will be of pine and the cover a black cloth
in the first place it will be a white cloth
nuns are buried in white
let it be a white cloth the n
you are not like other men father madeleine
to be holds uch devices which are not hinge lse than the savage and daring invention soft he galleys spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him and mingle with what he called the petty course of life in the convent caused fau che le vent as much amazement as a gull fishing in the gutter of the rue saint denis would inspire in a passerby
jean valjean went on the problem is to get out of herewith out being seen
this offer sthe means
but give me some information in the first place
how is it managed
where is this coffin
the empty one
yes
downstairs in what is called the dead room
it stands on two trestles under the pall
how long is the coffin
six feet
what is this dead room
it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by ashu tter and two doors on elea dsi ntot he convent the other into the church
what church
the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
have you the keys to those two doors
no ihave the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
when does the porter open that door
only to allow the undertaker 's men to enter when the yc ome to get the coffin
when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again
who nails up the coffin
id o
who spreads the pall over it
id o
are you alone
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room
that is even written on the wall
could you hide mein that room tonight when everyone is asleep
no
but i could hide you in a small dark no ok which opens on the dead room where i keep my tools to use for burial sand of which ihave the key
at what time will the hearse come forth eco ffi nto morrow
about three o'clock in the afternoon
the burial will take place at the va ugi rard cemetery alittle before nightfall
it is not very near
iwill remain concealed in your tool close tall night and all the morning
and how about food
is hall be hungry
iwill bring you something
you can come and nail me up in the coffin at two o'clock
fau che le vent recoiled and cracked his finger joints
but that is impossible
bah
impossible to take a hammer and drives omen ails in a plan k
what seemed unprecedented to fau che le vent was were peat as imple matter to jean valjean
jean valjean had been in worse straits than this
any man who has been a prisoner understand show to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kill shim
an escape is a cure
what does not a man under goforth esa keo facu re
to have himself nailed up in a case and carried off like a bale of goods to live for along time in a box to find a irw here there is none to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean 's gloomy talents
moreover aco ffi nco nta in ing a living being that convict 's expedient is also an imperial expedient
if we are to credit the monk austin castille jot his was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the plomb esf or the last time after his abdication
he had her brought into an dcar ried out of the monastery of saint yu stein this manner
fau che le vent who had recovered himself alittle exclaimed but how will you manage to breathe
iwill breathe
in that box
the mere thought of its uff oca tes me
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and the rear ound my mouth and you will nail the top plan kon loosely
good
and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
aman who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
and jean valjean added father fau che le vent we must come to a decision imus tei the rbe caught her eor accept this escape through the hearse
everyone has not iced the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door
whois the re who has not said to a cat doc ome in
the rear eme nw how he nani ncid ents tan dsh al fopen before the mha vet he same tendency to halt in indecision between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by fate
the over prudent cats as the yare and because they are cats sometimes in cur more danger than the audacious
fau che le vent was ofthis hesitating nature
but jean valjean 's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself
he grumbled well since the reis no other means
jean valjean resume dthe only thing which trouble smei sw hat will take place at the cemetery
that is the very point that is not troublesome exclaimed fau che le vent
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin allright iams ure of getting you out of the grave
the gravedigger is a drunkard and afri end of mine
he is father mest ie nne
an old fellow of the oldschool
the gravedigger puts the corpses in the grave and iput the gravedigger in my pocket
iwill tell you what will take place
the yw ill arrive alittle before dusk three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed
the hearse will drive directly upto the grave
is hall follow that is my business
is hall have a hammer ach is eland some pincers in my pocket
the hearse halts the undertaker 's men knot a rope around your coffin and lower you do wn
the priests a yst he prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
iam left alone with father mest ie nne
he is my friend it elly ou
one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
if he is not drunk is hall say to him ' come and drink about while the bon coin gthe good quince is open
' icar ry him off ige thi mdr unk it does not take long to make father mest ie nne drunk heal ways has the beginning of it about him ila yh im under the table it ake his cards otha tica nget into the cemetery again and iret urn with out him
the ny ou have no longer anyone but metod eal with
if he is drunk is hall say to him ' be off iwill do you rwork for you
' off he goes and i drag you out of the hole
jean valjean held out his hand and fau che le vent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant
that is settled father fau che le vent
all will go well
provided nothing goes wrong though tfa uchel event
in that case it would be terrible
chapter vi tis not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passersby on the boulevard du maine pulled off the ir hats to an old fashioned hear seo rna mented with skulls crossbones and tears
this hear secon tained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread ala rge black cross like a huge corpse with drooping arms
amour ning coach in which could be seen apr ies tinh is surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
two undertake r 's men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along
the process ion was going in the direction of the va ugi rard cemetery
the handle of a hammer the blade of a cold chisel and the antenna eof apa iro fpi ncer swer evi sible protruding from the man 's pocket
the va ugi rard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris
it had its peculiar usage sju stasi thad its carriage entrance and its house door which old people in the quarter who clung tenacious lyt oan cient words still called the port eca valier eand the port epi eton ne
the bernardine sbe ned ict in esoft her uep et it pic push a dob tained permission as we have already stated to be buried there in acorn era part and at night the plot of land having formerly belonged to the irc ommunity
the gravedigger sbe in gth usb ound to service in the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery the yw eres ub jected to as pecial discipline
the gates of the paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a municipal regulation the va ugi rard cemetery was bound by it like the rest
the carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grated gates adjoining a pavilion built by the architect perrone tandi nha bite dby the doorkeeper of the cemetery
the sega test here for esw ung inexorably on the ir hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the dome of the invalid es
if any gravedigger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery the rewa sbu to new ayf or him to get out his gravedigger 's card furnished by the department of public funeral s
as orto flett erb ox was constructed in the porter 's window
the gravedigger dropped his car dint oth is box the porter heard it fall pulled the rope and the small door opened
if the man had not his car dhe mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with his key the gravedigger stepped out but had to pay a fine of fifteen francs
this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration
it was suppressed alittle later than
the cemetery of montparnasse called the eastern cemetery succeeded to it and inherited that famous drams hop next to the va ugi rard cemetery which was surmounted by a quince painted on aboard and which formed an angle on esi deon the drinkers ' table sand the other onthe to mbs with this sign a ubon coin g
the va ugi rard cemetery was what maybe called a faded cemetery
it was falling into disuse
dampness was invading it the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the va ugi rard it hinted at poverty
per elac hai seif you please
to be buried in per elac hai seis equivalent to having furniture of mahogany
it is recognized as elegant
the va ugi rard cemetery was a venerable enclosure planted like an old fashioned french garden
straight all eys box thu yat rees holly ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees and very tallgrass
in the evening it was tragic the re
the re were very lugubrious lines about it
the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white palla ndt he black cross entered the avenue of the va ugi rard cemetery
the lame man who followed it was no other than fau che le vent
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the exit of cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and the reha dbe enno hitch
let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfect ly venial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of the irow nco nsci ences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an inter meddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
in the first place the rule as for the code we shall see
make a sma nyla wsa syo up lease men but keep the mfor yourselves
the tribute to caesar is never anything but there mna nts of the tribute to go d
apr in ceis nothing in the presence of a principle
fau che le vent limped along behind the hearse in avery content edf ram eof mind
his twin plots the one with the nuns the one for the convent the other against it the other with m
madeleine had succeeded to all appearance
jean valjean 's composure was one of those powerful tranquil lit ies which are contagious
fau che le vent nolonger felt doubtful as to his success
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
within the last two years he had made good father mest ie nne ach ubb ych eek edp erson drunk atleast tent imes
he played with father mest ie nne
he did what he liked with him
he made him dance according to his whim
mest ie nne 's head adjusted itself to the cap off auch eleven t 's will
fau che le vent 's confidence was perfect
atthe moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery fau che le vent glance dc he erful lya tthe hear sean dsa id half aloud as he rubbed his big hands here'sa fine farce
all at once the hearse halted it had reached the gate
the permission for interment must be exhibited
the undertaker 's man address ed himself to the porter of the cemetery
during this colloquy which always is productive of adela yof from one to two minutes someone astra nger came and placed himself behind the hearse beside fau che le vent
he was a sort of labor in gman who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried am at tock under his arm
fau che le vent surveyed this strange r
who are you
hedeman de d
the man replied the gravedigger
if a man could survive the blow of a cannonball full inthe breast he would make the same face that fau che le vent made
the gravedigger
yes

fau che le vent had expected anything but this that agrave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that gravedigger sdo diet he msel ves
by dint of excavating graves for other people on eho llow souto ne 's own
fau che le vent stood there with his mouth wide open
he had hardly the strength to stammer but it is not possible
it is so
but he persisted feebly father mest ie nne is the gravedigger

the choir boy alighted from the mourning coach the nth epri est
one of the small front wheel soft hehe arse had run up alittle on a pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible

repeated fau che le vent in consternation
chapter vi between four plan ks who was in the coffin
the reader knows
jean valjean
jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there and he could almost breathe
it is a strange thing to what a degree security of conscience confers security of the rest
every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progressing and progressing favorably since the preceding day
he like fau che le vent counted on father mest ie nne
he had no doubt as to the end
never was the ream or ecrit ical situation nevermore complete composure
the four plan ks of the coffin breathe out akin do fter rib lepe ace
it seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into jean valjean 's tranquillity
from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow and he had followed all the phase soft heter rib led rama which he was playing with death
shortly after fau che le vent had finished nailing on the upper plan kje an valjean had felt himself carried out the ndr ive no ff
he knew from the diminution in the jolting when the yle ftth epa vem ents and reached the earth road
he had divine dfr oma dull noise that the yw erec rossing the bridge of austerlitz
atthe first halt he had understood that the yw eree nter in gthe cemetery at the second halt he said to himself here is the grave
suddenly he felt hands seize the coffin the nahar shg rating against the plan ksh eex plain edit to himself as the rope which was being fastened round the casket inorder to lower it into the cavity
the nhe experience dag iddi ness
the undertaker 's man and the gravedigger had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance and had lowered the head before the foot
here covered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless
he had just touched the bottom
he had a certain sensation of cold
avo ice rose above him glacial and solemn

the grave voice resume dre qui esca tin pace
and the child 's voice said amen
jean valjean strained his ears and heard something like retreating footsteps
the re they are going now thought he
iam a lone
all at once he heard over his head as ound which seemed to him to be a clap of thunder
it was a shovel ful of earth falling on the coffin

one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up
at hird shovel ful of earth fell

the rear eth in gsw hich are too strong for the strongest man
jean valjean lost consciousness
chapter viii nw hich will be found the origin of the saying don't lose the card this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean
when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and take nthe ird epa rtu ref auch eleven twh ohad not take nhis eyes from the gravedigger saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel which was sticking up right in the heap of dirt
the nfa uchel event took a supreme resolve
he placed himself between the grave and the gravedigger crossed his arms and said iam the one to pay
the gravedigger stared at him in amazement and replied what 's that peasant
fau che le vent repeated iam the one who pays
what
for the wine
what wine
that argenteuil wine
where is the argenteuil
atthe bon coin g

said the gravedigger
and he flung as hovel ful of earth on the coffin
the coffin gave back aho llow sound
fau che le vent felt himself stagger and onthe point of falling headlong into the grave himself
he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle comrade
before the bon coin gis shut
the gravedigger to oks ome more earth on his shovel
fau che le vent continued
iwill pay
and he seized the man 's arm
listen to me comrade

and he flourished his shovel briskly
fau che le vent held him back
it is argenteuil wine at six
ohcom esa id the gravedigger you are abell ringer

and he threw in a second shovel ful
fau che le vent had reached a point where he nolonger knew what he was saying
come along and drink he cried since it is iw hop ays the bill
when we have put the child to be dsa id the gravedigger
he flung in a third shovel ful
the nhe thrust his shovel in to the earth and added it 's cold tonight you see and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a cover let
at that moment as he loaded his shovel the gravedigger be nto vera ndt he pocket of his waistcoat gaped
fau che le vent 's wild gaze fell mechanical lyin to that pocket and the reits topped
the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white atthe bottom of that yawning pocket
the sumtotal of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain traverse dfa uchel event 's pupils
an idea had just occurred to him
he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the gravedigger who was wholly absorbed in his shovel ful of earth observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it
the man sent a fourth shovel ful tumbling into the grave
just as he turned round to get the fifth fau che le vent looked calmly at him and said by the way you newman have you your card
the gravedigger paused
what card
the sun is on the point of setting
that 's good it is going to put on its nightcap
the gate of the cemetery will close immediately

the gravedigger dropped his shovel

the gravedigger overwhelmed with gratitude shook his hand and set of fon arun
when the man had disappeared in the thicket fau che le vent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance the nhe leaned over the grave and said in a low to nefa the rma del eine

fau che le vent was seized with a shudder
he tumbled rather than climbed into the grave flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried are you there
silence in the coffin
fau che le vent hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his cold chisel and his hammer and pried up the coffin lid
jean valjean 's face appeared in the twilight it was pale and his eyes were closed
fau che le vent 's hair rose upright on his head he sprang to his feet then fell back against the side of the grave ready to swoon on the coffin
he stared at jean valjean
jean valjean lay there pallida nd motionless
fau che le vent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh he is dead
and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fist scam ein contact with his shoulders he cried and this is the way is a vehi sli fe
the nth epo or man fell to sobbing

jean valjean 's eyes were open and gazing at him
to see acorp seis alarming to be hold a resurrection is almost as much so

jean valjean had merely fainted
the fresh air had revived him
joy is the ebb of terror
fau che le vent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean had

he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out ago urd with which he had provided himself
but first take a drop said he
the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties
he got out of the coffin and helped fau che le vent to nail on the lid again
three minutes later the yw ere out of the grave
moreover fau che le vent was perfectly composed
he took his time
the cemetery was closed
the arrival of the gravedigger grib ie rw as not to be apprehended

when the grave was full fau che le vent said to jean valjean let us go
iwill keep the shovel do you carry off the mattock
night was falling
jean valjean experience drome difficult yin moving and in walking
he had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a corpse
the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four plan ks
he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb
you are ben umb eds aid fau che le vent
it is a pity that ihave agam ele gfor otherwise we might step out briskly

how well everything is going
said fau che le vent what a capital idea that was of your sfa the rma del eine
the ypa ssed the va ugi rard barrier in the simplest manner in the world

the rue va ugi rard was deserted

the reis noone in the streets aid fau che le vent
give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me
fau che le vent entered no
ascended to the very top guide dby the instinct which always leads the poor man to the garret and knocked in the dark at the door of an attic
avo ice replied come in
it was grib ie r 's voice
fau che le vent opened the door
the gravedigger 's dwelling was like all such wretched habitation san unfurnished and encumbered garret

the whole of this poverty stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned
one would have said that the reha dbe enan earthquake for one
the cover swer edis place dthe rags scattered about the jug broken the mother had been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous and ill tempered search
it was plain that the gravedigger had made a desperate search for his car dan dha dma de everybody in the garret from the jug to his wife responsible for its loss
he wore a nair of desperation
but fau che le vent was into ogre at a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success
he entered and said ihave brought you back your shovel and pick
grib ie rga zed at him in stu pef action
is it you peasant
and tomorrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery
and he laid the shovel and matt ock on the floor
what is the meaning of this
demanded grib ie r
the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out of your pocket that if ound it on the ground after you were gone that ihave buried the corpse that ihave filled the grave that ihave done your work that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have to pay fifteen francs

chapter viii as ucce ssf ulint erro gator yan hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented themselves at no
rue petit pic pus
the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped
the yw ere fau che le vent jean valjean and cosette
the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the fruit ere r 's in the rue du chemin vert where fau che le vent had deposited her on the preceding day
cosette had passed the set went yf our hours trembling silently and understanding nothing
she trembl edt osu chad eg re eth at shewe pt
she had neither eaten nor slept
the worthy fruits eller had plied her with a hundred questions without obtaining a nyo the rre ply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze
cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days
she divine dth at the yw ere passing through a crisis
she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good
who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words pronounced with a certain accent in the ear of a terrified little being say nothing
fear is mute
moreover noone guards as ecre tli keach il d
but when a tthe expiration of the sel ugu brio us twenty four hours she beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any thought fulp erson who had chance dto heart hat cry would have guessed that it is sued from an abyss
fau che le vent belonged to the convent and knew the password s
all the doors open ed
thus was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in
the porter who had received his instructions opened the little servant 's door which connected the courtyard with the garden and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago in the wall at the bottom of the court which faced the carriage entrance
the porter admitted all three of the mth rough this door and from that point the yr each edt he inner reserved parlor where fau che le vent on the preceding day had received his orders from the prior ess
the prior ess rosary in hand was waiting for the m

fau che le vent replied from pic qui gn yn ear amiens
what is your age
fau che le vent replied fifty
what is your profession
fau che le vent replied garden er
are you ago odc hris tian
fau che le vent replied everyone is in the family
is this your little girl
fau che le vent replied yes reverend mother
you are her father
fau che le vent replied her grandfather
the vocal mother said to the prior essi nalo wv oic ehe answers well
jean valjean had not uttered a single word
the prior essl ook eda tte nti vel yat cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother she will grow up ugly
the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor the nth epri or ess turned round and said father fauve nt you will get another kneecap with a bell
two will be required now
onthe following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of the irv eil s
atthe extreme end of the garden under the trees two men fauve nta nda not herman were visible as the yd ugs ide by side
an enormous event
the irs ile nce was broken to the extent of saying to eachother he is an assistant garden er
the vocal mother sad de dhe is a brother of father fauve nt
jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belle dk nee cap henceforth he was official
his name was ultime fau che le vent
the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prior ess 's observation upon cosette she will grow up ugly
the prior ess that pronounced prognostic at or immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her aplac ein the school as a charity pupil
the reis nothing that is not strictly logical about this
it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of the irfa ces now girls who are conscious of the irb eau ty donot easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to the irg ood looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty
hence alive lyta stef or plain girls
the whole of this adventure increased the importance of good old fau che le vent he won at rip les ucce ssi nthe eyes of jean valjean who mhe had saved and sheltered in those of gravedigger grib ie rwho said to himself he spared me that fine with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar eluded caesar and satisfied god
the rewa saco ffi nco nta in ing a body in the petit pic pusan daco ffi nwi thou tab ody in the va ugi rard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed the re by but noone was aware of it
as for the convent its gratitude to fau che le vent was very great
fau che le vent became the best of servi to rsa ndt hemos tpr eci ous of gardeners
upon the occasion of the archbishop 's next visit the prior ess recounted the affair to his grace making something of a confession at the same time and yet boasting of her deed
on leaving the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper to m
del at ilm on sieur 's confessor afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal
this admiration for fau che le vent became widespread for it made it sway to rome
wehave seen an ote address ed by the then reigning pope leo xii
to one of his relatives amon sign or in the nuncio 's establishment in paris and bearing like himself the name of della gen gait contained the selin esi tap pears that the reis in a convent in paris an excellent garden erw hoi sals oah oly man named fauve nt
nothing of this triumph reached fau che le vent in his hut he went on grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds with out in the least suspecting his excellence sand his sanctity
neither did he suspect his glory anymore than a durham or surrey bull whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news with this inscription bull which carried off the prize at the cattle show
chapter ix cloistered cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent
it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean valjean 's daughter
moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and the nsh ewo uld not have said anything in any case
as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness
cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything event osp ea kort obr eat he
asin glew or dha dso often brought down an avalanche upon her
she had hardly be gun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean
she speedily became accustomed to the convent
only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so
once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known iwould have brought her away with me
cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to do nthe garbo fthe pupils of the house
jean valjean succeeded in getting the mtor estore to him the garments which she laid aside
this was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the then a rdi ers ' in n
it was not very thread bare even now
jean valjean locked up the sega rme nts plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatic sin which convent sabo und in alittle valise which he found means of procuring
he set this valise on a chair near his bed and heal ways carried the key about his person
father cosette asked him on eda yw hat is the rein that box which smells so good

moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out
javert watched the quarter for more than a month
this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by gulf s
henceforth those four walls constitute dhis world
he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy
avery sweet life began for him
he inhabited the old hut at the end of the garden in company with fau che le vent
this hovel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in wasco mpos edas the reader already know soft hree chambers all of which were utterly bare and had nothing beyond the walls
the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain to m

jean valjean worked in the garden everyday and made himself very useful
he had formerly been a pruner of trees and he gladly found himself agard enero nce more
it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture
he turned the set oad vantage
almost all the trees in the orchard were ung rafted and wild
he budded the man dma de them produce excellent fruit
cosette had permission to pass an hour with him everyday
as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparison sand adored him
atthe appointed hour she flew to the hut
when she entered the lowly cabins he filled it with paradise
jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette
the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing meagre like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever
at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the rest
for cosette laughed now
cosette 's face had even under gone achan get oac ert aine xten t
the gloom had disappeared from it
as mile is the same as sunshine it banishes winter from the human countenance
recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her classroom and at night hero set olo ok at the windows of her dormitory
god has his own way smor eo vert he convent contributed like cosette to uphold and complete the bishop 's work in jean valjean
it is certain that virtue adjoins pride on one side
abridge built by the devil exists there
jean valjean had been unconscious ly perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the convent of the petit pic puss olo nga she had compare dhi msel fon lyt othe bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for sometime past he had been comparing himself to me ningen eral and pride was beginning to spring up
who knows
he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred
the convent stopped him on that downward path
this was the second place of captivity which he had seen
in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had beheld another afri ght fulp lace at err ible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law

was this as ym bolo fhi sdes tiny
this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one when ceh ehad fled and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar
again he beheld gratings bolts iron bars to guard who m

when he thought on the set hing sall that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity
in the seme dita tions his pride vanished
he scrutinized his own heart in all manner of ways he felt his pettiness and many atime he wept
all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back to ward sthe bishop 's holy injunction sco setteth rough love the convent through humility
sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the walk which skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had gazed on the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer
thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister
it seemed as though he dared not knee ldir ect ly before god
everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant flowers those children who uttered joyous cries those grave and simple women that silent cloisters low ly permeated him and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children
and the nhe reflected that the seh adbe ent woh ouse so fg odw hich had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life the first when all doors were closed and when humans ociety rejected him the second at a moment when humans ociety had again set out in pursuit of him and when the galleys were again yawning and that had it not been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and had it not been for the second in to torment
his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more
many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up

the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition
his tendency and we say it with the proper amount of regret would not constitute classic taste
he is not very academic by nature

he is not easily astonished heisst ill less easily terrified he makes songs on superstitions he takes the wind out of exaggeration she twits mysteries he thrust south is to ngu eat ghosts he takes the poetry out of stilted things he introduces caricature into epic extravaganza s

the boy who sena me was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more
noone opened his mouth to him about it
nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather to ok him whispers in nuendo esa nd winks had eventually enlightened the little boy 's mind he had finally understood something of the case and ashen atural lyt ook in the idea sand opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart
while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sly like a criminal breaking his banan dwe nta ndp ost ed himself at saint sulpice at the hour when aunt gillen or man dled marius to the mass
the retr embl ingles tthe aunts hould turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child
the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster
from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m
l' abbe mabe uf
that worthy priest was the brother of award en of saints ulp ice who had often observed this manga zing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes
that man who had soma nly an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden
that face had clung to his mind
one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pont mercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of saints ulp ice
the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel avis it on some pretext or other
this visit led to other s
the colonel who had been extremely reserved at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how pont mercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child 's future
this caused the cure to regard him with veneration and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fondo fthe cure
and more over when both are sincere and good nomen so penetrate eachother and so amalgamate with eachother as an old priest and an old soldier
at bottom them an isthe same
the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference
twice a year on the first of january and on st
george 's day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some form ula this was all that m

it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life
this opening was so mbr eand more cold than warmth more night than day came to him through this skylight
this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave
surrounded by all those singular and imposing person ages he gazed about him with serious amazement
everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him

marius pont mercy pursued some studies as a llc hildren do
when he emerged from the hands of aunt gillen or man dhis grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence
this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant
marius went through his years of college then he entered the laws chool
he was a royal is tfa nati calan dse vere
he did not love his grandfather much as the latter 's gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy
he was on the whole aco lda nda rd ent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic ladd ign ified to harshness pure to shyness
chapter iv end of the brigand the conclusion of marius ' classical studies coincided with m
gillen or man d' s departure from society
the old man bad efa re well to the faubourg saint germain and to madame de t

one evening on his return home hesa whi sgr and father holding a letter in his hand
marius said m
gillen ormandy ou will set out for vernon tomorrow
why
said marius
to see your father
marius was seized with a trembling fit
he had thought of everything except this that he should one day be called upon to see his father
nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit it more disagreeable to him
it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation
it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty
marius inaddition to his motives of political antipathy was convinced that his father the slasher as m
gillen or man dcal led him on his amiable days didnot love him this was evident since he had abandoned him to other s
feeling that he was not be loved he did not love
nothing is more simple he said to himself
he was so astounded that he did not question m
gillen or man d
the grandfather resume dita ppe ars that he is ill

and after a pause head de dset out tomorrow morning
it hink the reis acoa chw hich leaves the cour des fontaine sat six o'clock and which arrives in the evening

he says that he reis has te
the nhe crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket
marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning
adil igen cef rom the rue du boul oit ook the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon
neither marius norm
gillen or man dth ought of making inquiries about it
the next day at twilight marius reached vernon
people were just beginning to light the irc and les
he asked the first person who mhe met for m
pont mercy 's house
for in his own mind he agreed with the restoration and like it did not recognize his father 's claim to the title of either colonel or baron
the house was pointed out to him
her an ga woman with alittle lamp in her hand opened the door
m
pont mercy
said marius
the woman remained motionless
is this his house
demanded marius
the woman nodded affirmative ly
can isp ea kwi th him
the woman shook her head
but i am his son
persisted marius
heise xp ect in gme

the nhep erc eiv edt hats he was weeping
she pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor heen tered
in that room which was lighted by a tall owc and lest and in gon the chimney piece there were three men ones tandi nger ect another kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt
the one on the floor was the colonel
the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in prayer
the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously
as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he had written to m
gillen or man dto demand his son
the malady had grown worse
onthe very evening of marius ' arrival at vernon the colonel had had an attack of delirium he had risen from his bed in spite of the servant 's efforts to prevent him crying my son is not coming
is hall goto meet him
the nhe ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber
he had just expired
the doctor had been summoned and the cure
the doctor had arrived to olate
the son had also arrived to olate
by the dim light of the candle ala rge tear could be distinguished on the pale and prostrate colonel 's cheek where it had trickled from his dead eye
the eye was extinguished but the tear was not yet dry
that tear was his son 's delay
marius gazed upon that man who mhe beheld for the first time on that venerable and manly face on those open eyes which saw no to nth ose white locks those robust limbs on which he rea ndt here brown lines markings word thrust sand as orto fred stars which indicated bullet holes were visible
he contemplated that gigantic sea rw hich stamped heroism on that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness
here flected that this man was his father and that this man was dead and achill ran over him
the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man who mhe had chance dto behold stretched out in death
anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber
the servant woman was lamenting in acorn erth ecu re was praying and his sobs were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping
the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of the iraf flict ion without uttering a word he was the stranger the re
marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude hehe ldh is hatin his hand and he dropped it on the floor in order to produce the impression that grief had deprived him of the strength to hold it
atthe sametime he experienced remorse and he despised him self for behaving in this manner
but was it his fault
he did not love his father
why should he
the colonel had left nothing
the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial
the servant found as crap of paper which she handed to marius
it contained the following in the colonel 's handwriting for my son
the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo
since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood myson shall take it and bear it
that he will be worth yof it is a matter of course
below the colonel had added at that same battle of waterloo as erg ean tsa ved mylife
the man 's name was the nardi er
it hink that he has recently been keeping alittle in nina village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles or mont ferme il
if my son meets him he will do all the good he can tothe nardi er
marius to okt his paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man
nothing remained of the colonel
m
gillen or man dha dhis sword and uniform sold to an old clothes dealer
the neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers
the other plants turned to nettles and weeds and died
marius remained only for tye ight hours at vernon
after the interment here turned to paris and applied himself again to his laws tudies with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived
in two days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten
marius wore crap eon his hat
that was all
chapter vthe utility of going to mass in order to become a revolution is tma riu shad preserved the religious habits of his childhood
one sunday when he went to hear mass at saint sulpice at that same chapel of the virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small lad he placed himself behind a pillar being more absent minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion and knelt down with out paying any special heed upon a chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name monsieur mabe ufw arden
mass had hardly be gun when an old man presented himself and said to marius this is myplaces ir
marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his chair

it seems to me that the mass is better from here
why
iwill tell you
it is from this place that ihave watched a poor brave father come regularly every two or three months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family arrangements
he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass
the little one never suspected that his father was the re
perhaps he did not even know that he had a father poor innocent
the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen
he gazed at his child and he wept

he lived at vernon where i have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pont marie or mont percy
he had a fine sword cut on my honor
pont mercy suggested marius turning pale
precisely pont mercy
did you know him
sir said marius he was my father
the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed a h
you are the child
yes that 's true he must be a man by this time
well
poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly
marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings
onthe following day he said to m
gillen or mandi have arranged a hunting party with some friends
will you permit me to be absent for three days
four
replied his grandfather
go and amuse yourself
and he said to his daughter in a low to nea nd with a wink some love affair
chapter vi the consequences of having met award en where it was that marius went will be disclosed alittle further on
marius was absent for three days the nhe returned to paris went straight to the library of the laws chool and asked for the files of the moniteur

marius came to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species of lion lamb who had been his father

sometimes the old man added the deuce
it hough tit was only an affair of gallantry its eem sth at it is an affair of passion
it was a passion in fact
marius was on the high road to adoring his father
atthe sametime his ideas under went an extraordinary change
the phase soft his change were numerous and successive
as this is the history of many minds of our day we think it will prove useful to follow the sep has ess tep by step and to indicate the mall
that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled him
the first effect was to dazzle him
upto that time there public the empire had been to him only monstrous words
the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire as word in the night

little by little when his astonishment had passed off hegre wacc us to me dto this radiance he contemplated the sede eds without dizziness he examined the seper son ages without terror there volution and the empire presented themselves luminous lyin perspective before his mind 's eye he beheld each of the seg roup so fev ents and of men summed up in two tremendous facts there public int he sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses the empire in the sovereignty of the french idea imposed on europe hebe held the grand figure of the people emerge from the revolution and the grand figure of france spring forth from the empire
he asserted in his conscience that all this had been good
what his dazzled state neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation wed on ott hink it necessary to point out here
it is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording
progress is not accomplished in one stage
that state don cef oral lincon nection with what precedes a swell as with what is to follow we continue
he then perceived that upto that moment he had comprehended his country nomo retha nh ehad comprehended his father
he had not know neither the one or the other and as orto fvo lunt ary night had obscured his eyes
now he saw and onthe one hand head mired while on the other head or ed
he was filled with regret and remorse and here flected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb
oh
if his father had still be enine xis tence if he had still had him if god in his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated himself how he would have cried to his father father
here iam
it is i
ihave the same heart as thou
iam thy son
how he would have embraced that whitehead bathed his hair in tears gazed upon his scarp res sed his hands adored his garment kissed his feet
oh
why had his father died so early before his time before the justice the love of his son had come to him
marius had a continual so bin his heart which said to him every moment alas
atthe sametime he became more truly serious more truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith
at each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason
an inward growth seemed to be in progress within him
he was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to him his father and his country
as everything open sw henon eha sake yso he explained to himself that which he had hated he penetrated that which he had abhorred henceforth he plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detest and ofthe great men who mhe had been instructed to curse
when he reflected on his former opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seemed to him already so very ancient hegre wind ign an tye the smiled
from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of napoleon
but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor
from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgment soft hepa rt yof on bonaparte
now all the prejudices of the restoration all its interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon
it exec rated him even more than it did robespierre
it had very clever lyt urn edt osu ffi ciently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of mothers
bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and inorder to paint him to the imagination of the people which aswel at ely pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of made him appear under allsorts of terrifying masks in succession from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo
thus in speaking of bonaparte one was free to sob or to puff up with laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom
marius had never entertained about that man as he was called anyother ideas in his mind
the yha dcom bined with the tenacity which existed in his nature
the rewa sinh ima headstrong little man who hated napoleon
on reading history on studying him especially in the document sand materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes of marius was gradually rent
he caught a glimpse of something immense and he suspected that he had been deceived upto that moment on the score of bonaparte as about all the rest each day he saw more distinctly and he set about mounting slowly step by step almost regretfully in the beginning the nwi thin toxic ation and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps the nth eva gue ly illuminated steps atlas tthe luminous and splendid steps of enthusiasm
one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof
his candle was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window
all sorts of reveries reached him from space and mingled with his thoughts
what aspect acle is the night
one hears dull sounds without knowing when cet hey proceed on ebe holds jupiter which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand the azure is black the stars shine it is formidable
he was perusing the bulletin soft he grand army those heroic strop he spen ned on the field of battle the reat intervals he beheld his father 's name always the name of the emperor the whole of that great empire presented itself to him he felt a flood swelling and rising within him its eem edt ohim at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath and whispered in his ear he gradually got into a singular state het hough tth at hehe ard drums cannon trumpets the measured tread of battalion sthe dull and distant gallop of the cavalry from time to time his eyes were raised heavenward and gazed upon the colossal constellations as the yg lea medi nthe measure less depth so fsp ace the nth ey fell upon his book on cem or eand the re they beheld other colossal things moving confused ly
his heart contract ed within him
he was in a transport trembling panting
all at once without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window gazed in tently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the eternal immensity and exclaimed long live the emperor
from that moment for thal lwa sover the ogre of corsica the usurper the tyrant the monster who was the love rof his own sister sthe actor who took lessons of tal math epo is one rof jaffa the tiger buona part eal lth is vanished and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar
the emperor had been for his father only the well beloved captain who mon ead mires for whom one sacrifice so ne 's self he was something more to marius
he was the predestined constructor of the french groups ucce edin gthe roman group in the domination of the universe
he was a prodigious architect of a destruction the continue rof charlemagne of louis xi
of henry iv
of richelieu of louis xiv
and ofthe committee of public safety having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots powerful in his crime
he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the great nation
he was better than that he was the very incarnation of france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world by the light which he shed
marius saw in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise up on the frontier and which will guard the future
despot but dictator ades pot resulting from a republican dsu mm in gup are volution
napoleon became for him the man people as jesus christ is the man god
it will be perceived that like all new converts to are ligi on his conversion intoxicated him he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went to ofa r
his nature was so constructed on ceo nthe downwards lope it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag
fanaticism for the sword to ok possession of him and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea
he did not perceive that alongwith genius and pell me ll he was admitting for cet hat is to say that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry on the one hand that which is divine on the other that which is brutal
in many respects he had set about deceiving himself otherwise
head mitted everything
the reis away of encountering error while on one 's way to the truth
he had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the lump
in the new path which he had entered on in judging the mistakes of the old regime as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating circumstances
at all events at reme nd ous step had been taken
where he had formerly beheld the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france
his orientation had changed
what had been his east became the west
he had turned square lyr ound
all the sere volution swer eac compli she dwi thin him without his family obtaining a nin kling of the case

this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him achan gein whichever yth in ggr avita ted round his father
only as he did not know anyone and could not so whi scards with any porter he put the minh is pocket
by another natural consequence in proportion as he drew nearer to his father to the latter 's memory and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before her eced edf rom his grandfather

and the nove rand above all marius experience dun utter a ble impulses to revolt when he reflected that it was m
gillen or man dwh ohad from stupid motives to rn him ruthlessly from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child of the father
by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at aversion for his grandfather
nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have already said
only hegre wco lde rand colder laconic at meals and rare in the house
when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and alleged his studies his lectures the examination set c

his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis in love
iknow all about it
from time to time marius absent ed himself
where is it that he goes off like this
said his aunt
on one of the set rips which were always very brief he went to mont ferme il in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the innkeeper the nardi er

marius was away from the house for four days on this quest

he had a lady 's waist avi ctor ious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a hook
he visited paris very rarely and so rarely that marius had never seen him
the cousins knew each other only by name
we think we have said that the odu lewa sthe favorite of aunt gillen or man dwh opre ferred him because she did not see him

one morning mademoiselle gillen or man dthe elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed asher placid it yw ascap able ofall owing

mademoiselle gillen or man dha das cen de dto her chamber great ly puzzle dando nthe staircase had dropped this exclamation this is to om uch

inorder to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her alittle beyond her wont she took refuge in her talents and set about scallop in gwi thon ela yer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the empire and the restoration in which the rear enum ero us cartwheels

the odu le replied with the composure of amano fbr on zes ome petticoat or other
and with that inward laugh which denotes certain tyhe added alas s
that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m

she resumed do usa favor

he does not know you it will be easy
since alas sthe reis try to get a sight of her

the odu le had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much to uche dby the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel
he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt

the lancer made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity
marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence with out suspecting that he was watched
as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep
his slumber was complete and conscientious
argus snored all night long
at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted vernon

the nash is memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking her ecal led his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render ofthe deeds and proceedings of marius
this set him to laughing
perhaps he is nolonger in the coach he thought as he rebut to ned the waistcoat of his undress uniform

at that moment apa iro fbla ckt rousers descending from the imperial made it sapp ear an cea tthe window of the coupe

said the lieutenant
it was marius
alittle peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilion sat the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers

she cried
marius approach edhe rand purchase dthe finest flowers in her flat basket

she must be as plen did lyh and some woman for so fine abou que t
iwan tto see her
and nolonger in pursuance of order sbu tfr omp ersonal curiosity like dogs who hunt on the irow nacc ount he set out to follow marius
marius paid no attention to the odu le
elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at the m
he seemed to see nothing around him
he is pretty deep lyin love
though tthe odu le
marius directed his steps towards the church
capital said the odu let ohim self
rendezvous season ed with a bit of mass are the best sort
nothing is so exquisite as an ogle which passes over the good god 's head
on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the apse
he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse
the rendezvous is appointed outside said the odu le
let 's have a look at the las s
and head vance dont he tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned
on arriving there he halted in amazement
marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on agrave
he had strewn his bouquet the re
atthe extremity of the grave on alittle swelling which marked the head there stood across of blackwood with this name in white letters colonel baron pont mercy
marius 's obs were audible
the las swa sag rave

here treated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and the rewa sdi sci pline in this retreat
death appeared to him with large epaulets and heal most made the military salute to him
not know in gwh at to write to his aunt he decided not to write a tall and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by the odu least othe love affair so fma riu sif by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate counters hock at paris
marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the morning descended at his grandfather 's door and wear ie dby the two nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming school he mounted rapidly to his chamber to ok merely time enough to throw off his travelling coat and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and went off to the bath
m
gillen or man dwh ohad risen betimes like all oldmen in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old legs permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius live dino rder to embrace him and toques tion him while so doing and to find out where he had been
but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend and when father gillen or man dente red the attic marius was nolonger the re
the bed had not been disturbed and onthe be dla you tsp read but not defiantly the great coat and the black ribbon

the entrance was atrium phan to ne

we are going to learn the most minute details wear ego in gto lay our finger on the debauch erie so four sly friend
here we have the romance itself
ihave the portrait
infact acas eof black shag re en resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon
the old man took this case and gazed at it for sometime without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which apo or hungry fellow behold san admirable dinner which is not for him pass under his very nose
for this evidently is a portrait
iknow all about such things
that is worn tenderly on the heart
how stupid they are
some abominable fright that will make us shudder probably
young men have such bad taste nowadays

said the aunt
and she put on her spectacles
the yun folded the paper and read as follows for my son
the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo
since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood myson shall take it and bear it
that he will be worth yof it is a matter of course

the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case
atthe same moment alittle oblong packet envelope din blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the great coat
mademoiselle gillen or man dpic kedit up and unfolded the blue paper

a full hour passed in the most profound silence
the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with the irb acks to eachother and were thinking each on his own account the same thing sinal lpr oba bility
atthe expiration of this hour aunt gillen or man dsa ida pretty state of things
afew moments later marius made his appearance
he entered
even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding on eof his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing well
well
well
well
well
soyo uar eab aron now
ipr ese nt you my compliments
what is the meaning of this
marius reddened slightly and replied it means that i am the son of my father
m
gillen or man dce as edt ola ugh and said harshly iam your father
my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and as ever eair was a humble and heroic man who served the republican dfr an ceg lori ously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath grapes hot and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two flags whore ceived twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love to of on dly two ingrate shi scount ryan dmy self
this was more than m
gillen or man dc ould be a rto hear
atthe word republic her ose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet
every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old royal is tthe effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand
from a dull hue he had turned red from red purple and from purple flame colored
marius
he cried
abominable child
id on otk now what you rfa the rwa s

in his turn it was marius who was the firebrand and m
gillen or man dwh owa sthe bellows
marius quivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire
he was the priest who behold sall his sacred wafers cast to the wind sthe fakir who behold sapa sse rb ysp it upon his idol
it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence
what was he todo
his father had just been trampled underfoot and stamped upon in his presence but by whom
by his grandfather
how was he to avenge the one without out raging the other
it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father una veng ed
onthe one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks
he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head the nhe raised his eyes gazed fixed lya this grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder down with the bourbons and that great hog of a louis xviii
louis xviii
had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him
the old man who had been crimson turned white rth an his hair
he wheeled round towards a bust of m
leduc deberry which stood on the chimney piece and made a profound bow with a sort of peculiar majesty
the nhep ace dtw ice slowly and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor creak as though he had been aston esta tue walking
on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calm aba ron like this gentleman and abour geo is like myself can not remain under the same roof
and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath he extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him be off
marius left the house
onthe following day m
gillen or man dsa id to his daughter you will send sixty pistol ese very six months to that blood drinker and you will never mention his name to me
having a nim mens eres erv ef undo fw rath to get rid of andnot knowing what to do with it heco nti nued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months
marius on his side had gone forth in indignation
the rewa son eci rcu mst an cew hich it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation
the rear eal ways petty fatalities of the sort which complicated ome stic drama s
the yau gme ntt he grievances in such cases although in reality the wrong sare not increase dby the m
while carrying marius 'd uds precipitate lyt oh is chamber at his grandfather 's command nicolette had inadvertently let fall probably on the attic staircase which was dark that medallion of black shag re en which contained the paper penned by the colonel
neither paper no rca sec ould afterwards be found
marius was convinced that monsieur gillen or man dfr omt hat day for thhe never alluded to him otherwise had flung his father 's testament in the fire
he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost
but the paper the writing that sacred relic all that was his very heart
what had been done with it
marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and without knowing where with thirty francs his watch and a few clothes in a handbag
he had entered a hackney coach had engaged it bythe hour and had directed his course at haphazard towards the latin quarter
what was to become of marius

you thw as onthe point may there ader pardon us the word of moulting
people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age
the needle which moves round the compass also moves in souls
each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take

his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him

how
not so badly

marius occupied in the go rbe a uh ouse for an annual sum of thirty francs aden minus afire place called a cabinet which contained on lyth emos tin dispensable articles of furniture
this furniture belonged to him
he gave three francs amon tht othe old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole and to bring him alittle hot water every morning afresh egg and a penny roll
he breakfast edon this egg and roll
his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sousa cco rding as eggs were dear or cheap
at six o'clock in the evening he descended the rue saint jacques to dine at rousseau 's opposite basset 's the stamp dealer 's on the corner of the rue de sma thu rins

for sixteen sous he had a smile and adin ner
this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied was a calming potion rather than are sta uran t

the proprietor had a fine nickname he was called rousseau the aquatic
thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sousa day which made three hundred and sixty five francs aye a r

he was rich
he sometimes lent ten francs to a friend

as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he had simplified matters
marius always had two complete suits of clothes the one old forever yday the other brand new for special occasions
both were black
he had but three shirts one on his person these condi nthe commode and the third in the washer woman 's hands

it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing condition

marius had not failed for a single day
he had endured everything in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debt s
he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed anyone as ou

he even said to himself that acre ditor is worse than a master for the master possesses only your person acre ditor possesses your dignity and can administer to it abox on the ear
rather than borrow he went without food

he never separate dthe memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them in his veneration
it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand altar for the colonel and the lesser one for the nardi er
what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude to ward sthe nardi erw as the idea of the distress in to which he knew that the nardi erh adfa llena nd which had engulfed the latter

this was marius 's weet esta nd most magnificent dream
chapter iii marius grown up at this epoch marius was twenty years of age
it was three years since he had left his grandfather
both parties had remained on the same terms without attempting to approach eachother and without seeking to see eachother
besides what was the use of seeing each other
marius was the brass vase while father gillen or man dwa sthe iron pot

at bottom as we have said m

he idolized him after his own fashion with an accompaniment of snap pish ness and boxes on the ear but this child once gone he felt a black void in his heart he would allow noone to mention the child to him and all the while secretly regretted that he was sowell obeyed

his pride in stantly answered yes but his age dhea dwh ich he shook in silence replied sadly no
he had his hours of depression
he missed marius
old men need affection as the yn eed the sun
it is warmth
strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some change in him
nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards that rogue but he suffered
he never inquire dabo uth im but he thought of him incessantly
he lived in the marais in amore and more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but his merriment had a convulsive harshness and his violence salwa yst ermin at edina sort of gentle and gloomy dejection
he sometimes said oh
if he only would return what ago odb oxon the ear iwould give him
as for his aunt she thought to olit tle to love much marius was nolonger for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cato rthe par oq uet which she probably had
what augmented father gillen or man d' s secret suffering was that he locked it all up with in his breast and did not allow it sexist ence to be divine d
his sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume the irow nsm ok e

while the old man regretted marius applauded himself
asist he case with all good hearted people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness
he only thought of m
gillen or mandi nanami able light but he had set his mind on notre ceiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father
this was the mitigated translation of his first indignation
moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering still
it was for his father 's sake
the hardness of his life satisfied and please dhi m
he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that had it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a father
that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering and he none of it and that in any case what were his toils and his destitution compare dwi tht he colonel 's heroic life
that in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel had meant to imply by the words he will be worth yof it
words which marius continued to wear not on his breast since the colonel 's writing had disappeared but in his heart
and the non the day when his grandfather had turned him out of doors he had been only a child now he was a man
he felt it
misery were peat had been good for him
poverty in youth when it succeeds has this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards effort and the whole soul towards aspiration
poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible bounds towards the ideal life
the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions horse race shunting dogs tobacco gaming good repast sandal lthe rest of it occupations for the base rsi de ofthe soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides
the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has eaten he has nothing more but meditation
he goes to the spectacle sw hich god furnishes gratis he gazes at the sky space the stars flowers children the human it yam on gwh ich heiss uffe ring the creation amid which he beams
he gazes so much on human it yth at hep erc eiv esi tss oul he gazes upon creation to such an extent that he behold sgod
he dreams he feels himself great he dreams on and feel shims elf tender
from the egotism of the man who suffer she passes to the compassion of the man who meditate s
an admirable sentiment breaks for thin him forgetfulness of self and pity for all
as he thinks of the innumerable enjoyment sw hich nature of fers gives an dla vis he sto souls which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to pity he the million naire of the mind the million naire of money
all hatred departs from his heart in proportion as light penetrates his spirit
and is he unhappy
no
the misery of a young man is never miserable
the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes his warm lyc irc ula ting blood his black hair his red lips his white teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor
and the never ym or ning he sets himself afresh to the task of earning his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column gains pride his brain gathers ideas
his task finished her et urns to ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joys he behold shi sfe ets et in affliction sino bst acle son the pavement in the nettles sometimes in the mire his head in the light
he is firms eren egen tle peaceful attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many aric hma nla cks work which makes him free and thought which makes him dignified
this is what had happened with marius
to tell the truth he inclined alittle to om uch to the side of contemplation
from the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certain tyhe had stopped thinking it good to be poor and retrench in gti me from his work to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire day sin meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance
he had thus propounded the problem of his life to toil as little as possible at material labor in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable in other words to be stow afew hours on real life and to cast the rest to the infinite
as he believed that he lacked nothing he did not perceive that contemplation thus understood ends by becoming one of the form so fid lene sst hath ewa sco nte nti nghi msel fwi thc on que ring the first necessities of life and that he was resting from his labors to oso on
it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this could only be at ran sito rys tate and that at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken
in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father gillen or man dth ought about the matter he was not practising he was not even pet tif oggi ng
meditation had turned him aside from pleading
to haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt upcase sw hat abor e
why should he do it
he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood

the other was a sort of little girl who mhe saw very often and who mhe never looked at
for more than a year marius had noticed in one of the walk soft he luxembourg the one which skirts the parapet of the pepin ie ream ananda very young girl who were almost always seated side by side on the same bench at the most solitary end of the alley on the rue de l' ouest side
everytime that that chance which meddle swith the stroll so fpe rso nsw hose gaze is turned inward sled marius to that walk and it was nearly every day he found this couple there
the man appeared to be about sixty years of age he seemed sadan dse rious his whole person presented the robust and wear yas pect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service
if he had worn adec oration marius would have said he is an ex office r
he had a kind ly but unapproachable air and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of anyone

only the yw ere always raised with a sort of displeasing assurance
her dress was both aged and childish like the dress of the scholars in a convent it consisted of a badly cut gown of black merino
the yha dthe air of being father and daughter

the yc on verse dto get her with a peaceful and indifferent air
the girl chattered incessantly and merrily
the old man talked but little and at times he fixed on here yes overflowing with an ineffable paternity
marius had acquired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk
he invariably found the mthe re
this is the way things went marius like dto arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from the irb en chh ewa lke dthe whole length of the alley passed in front of the mthe nre turned to the extremity when ceh ehad come and began again
this he did five or six times in the course of his promenade and the promenade was taken five or six times a week without its having occurred to him or to the sep eople to exchange agree ting
that person age and that you ng girl although the yapp eared and perhaps because they appeared to shun all glance shad naturally caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along the pepin ie ref rom time to time the studio usa fter the irl ect ures the other saft erth eir game of billiards

the students said a h
monsieur le blanc is on his bench
and marius like the rest had found it convenient to call this unknown gentleman monsieur le blanc

one day atlas the returned thither once more itwas as eren esu mme rmo rning and marius was in joyous mood as one is when the weather is fine
it seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to and all the bits of blues kyo fw hich he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees
he went straight to his alley and when he reached the end of it hep erc eiv eds till on the same bench that wellknown couple
only when he approached it certainly was the same man but it seemed to him that it was nolonger the same girl
the person who mhe now beheld was a tall and beautiful creature possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when the yare still combined with all the most ingenuous grace soft he child apu re and fugitive moment which can be expressed only by the set wow or dsf if teen years

and inorder that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face her nose was not handsome it was pretty neither straight nor curved neither italian nor greek it was the parisian nose that is to say spiritual delicate irregular pure which drives painters to despair and charms poets
when marius passed near her he could not see here yes which were constantly lowered
he saw only herlong chestnut lashes permeated with shadow and modesty
this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white haired oldman was saying to her and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile combined with those drooping eyes
for a moment marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man as is tero fthe former no doubt
but when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had examined her attentively here cogni zed her as the same

that evening on his return to his garret marius cast his eyes over his garments and perceived for the first time that he had been so slovenly in decorous and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the luxembourg with his everyday clothes that is to say with a hat battered near the band coarse carter 's boots black trousers which showed white atthe knees and a black coat which was pale at the elbows
chapter iv beginning of agreat malady on the following day at the accustomed hour marius drew from his wardrobe his new coat his new trousers his new hat and his new boots he clothed himself in this complete panoply put on his gloves at reme nd ous luxury and set of ffor the luxembourg
onthe way thither he encountered cour fey rac and pretended not to see him
cour fey raco nhis return home said to his friends ihave just met marius ' new hat and new coat with marius inside the m
he was going to pass an examination no doubt
he looked utterly stupid
on arriving at the luxembourg marius made the tour of the fountain basin and stared at the swans the nhe remained for along time in contemplation before asta tue whose head was perfectly black with mould and one of whose hips was missing
near the basin the rewa sabo urge ois for ty years of age with a prominent stomach who was holding bythe hand alittle urchin of five and saying to him shun excess myson keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy
marius listened to this bourgeois
the nhe made the circuit of the basin once more
atlas the direct ed his course towards his alleys low lya ndas if with regret
one would have said that he was both for ced to go there and with held from doing so
he did not perceive it himself and thought that he was doing a shea lwa ys did
on turning into the walk he saw m
leblanc and the young girl at the other end on the irb en ch
he button ed his coat upto the very top pulled it down on his body so that the remi ght be no wrinkles examined with a certain comp lais an cet he lustrous gleams of his trousers and marched on the bench
this march savored of an attack and certainly of a desire for conquest
so i say that he marched on the bench as is hould say hannibal march edon rome
however all his movements were purely mechanical and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupation so fhi smi nda nd labor s
at that moment he was thinking that the manuel dub acc ala urea twas a stupid book and that it must have been drawn up by rare idiots to allow of three tragedies of racine and only one comedy of moliere being analyzed the reina smast erp iec esoft he human mind
the rewa sap ie rci ng whistling going on in his ears
as he approached the bench hehe ldf as tto the folds in his coat and fixed his eyes on the young girl
it seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague bluelight
in proportion as he drew near his pace slackened more and more
on arriving at some little distance from the bench and long before he had reached the end of the walk he halted and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps
he did not even say to himself that he would not go as far as the end
it was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and not ed his fine appearance in his new clothes
nevertheless he held himself very erect in case anyone should be looking at him from behind
heat tained the opposite end the nca me back and this time he approached alittle nearer to the bench
he even got to within three intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further and he hesitated
he thought he saw the young girl 's face bending towards him
but he exerted a man lya ndvi olen teff or ts ubd ued his hesitation and walked straight ahead
afew seconds later he rushed in front of the bench erect and firm reddening to the very ears with out daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left with his hand thrust into his coat like a state sma n
atthe moment when he passed under the cannon of the place he felt his heart beat wildly
as onthe preceding day she wore her damask gown and her crap ebon net
hehe ardan ineffable voice which must have been her voice
she was talking tranquil ly
she was very pretty
he felt it although he made no attempt to see her
she could not however he thought help feeling esteem and consideration for me if she only knew that i am the veritable author of the dissertation on marcos obregon del aron de which m
francois de neuf chateau putas though it were his own atthe head of his edition of gilb las
he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the walk which was very near the ntu rne do nhis heel and passed on cem or ein front of the lovely girl
this time he was very pale
moreover all his emotions were disagreeable
as he went further from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble
he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halted near the middle of the walk and the reat hing which he never did he sat down and reflecting in the most profound lyin distinct depth so fhi sspi ritt hat after all it was hard that person sw hose white bonnet and black gown head mired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat
atthe expiration of aqua rte rof an hour her ose as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole
but here maine dst and in gthe remo tion less
for the first time in fifteen months he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there everyday with his daughter had on his side notice dhi man dpr oba bly considered his assiduity singular
for the first time also he was conscious of some irreverence indesign at ing that strange rev en in his secret thoughts by the sobriquet of m
leblanc
he stood thus for several minutes with drooping head tracing figures in the sand with the cane which he held in his hand
the nhe turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench to m
leblanc and his daughter and went home
that day he forgot to dine
at eight o'clock in the evening he perceived this fact and as it was too late to go down to the rue saint jacques he said nevermind
and at eabi to fbr ead
he did not got obed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with great care

marius was going out again in his new coat
he went to the luxembourg again but he did not proceed further than his bench midway of the alley
he seated himself there as onthe preceding day surveying from a distance and clearly making out the white bonnet the black dress and above all that bluelight
he did not stir from it and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg closed
he did not seem
leblanc and his daughter retire
he concluded that the yha dq uit te dthe garden bythe gate on the rue de l' ouest

she tried to follow him but marius walked briskly and with immense strides it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois
she lost sight of him in two minutes and return ed breathless three quarters choked with asthma and furious
if the reis any sense she growled inputting on one 's best clothes everyday and making people run like this
marius betook himself to the luxembourg
the young girl was the re with m
leblanc

afor tni ghtp assed thus
marius went to the luxembourg nolonger for the sake of strolling the rebut to seat himself always in the same spot and that without knowing why
once arrived there he did not stir
he put on his new coat every morning for the purpose of not showing himself and he began all over again on the morrow
she was decided lya marvellous beauty
the only remark approaching a criticism that could be made was that the contradiction between her gaze which was melancholy and her smile which was merry gave a rather wild effect to her face which sometimes caused this sweet countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming

she gazed steadily at him with a pensive sweetness which thrilled marius from head to foot

marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses
he felt his brain on fire
she had come to him what joy
and the nho wsh ehad looked at him
she appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet
beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic with a complete beauty which would have made petrarch sing and dante knee l

his worship of his father had gradually become a religion and like all religions it had retreated to the depths of his soul
something was required in the foreground
love came
a full month elapsed during which marius went everyday to the luxembourg
when the hour arrived nothing could hold him back
he is on duty said cour fey rac
marius live dinas tate of delight
it is certain that the young girl did look at him
he had finally grown bold and approached the bench
still he did not pass in front of it anymore in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to love rs
he considered it better not to attract the attention of the father
he combined his station sbe hind the trees and the pedestal soft he statues with a profound diplomacy so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman

her mouth replied to one and her glance replied to another
it must be supposed that m
leblanc finally noticed something for often when marius arrived her ose and began to walkabout
he had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the gladiator near the other end of the walk as though with the object of seeing whether marius would pursue the mth it her
marius did not understand and committed this error
the father began to grow in exact and nolonger brought his daughter everyday
sometimes he came alone
the nma riu sdi dno tst a y
another blunder
marius paid no heed to the ses ymp to ms
from the phase of timidity he had passed by an atural and fatal progress to the phase of blindness
his love increased
he dreamed of it every night
and the nan unexpected bliss had happened to him oil on the fire are doubling of the shadows over his eyes
one evening at dusk he had found on the bench which m
leblanc and his daughter had just quit ted aha nd kerchief avery simple handkerchief with out embroidery but white and fine and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume
he seized it with rapture
this handkerchief was marked with the letters u

marius knew nothing about this beautiful child neither her family name her christian name nor her abode the set wole tter swer ethe first thing of her that he had gained possession of adorable initial sup on which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding

he exclaimed
this handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman who had simply let it fall from his pocket
in the day sw hich followed the finding of this treasure he only displayed himself at the luxembourg inthe act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart
the beautiful child under stood nothing of all this and signified it to him by imperceptible signs

said marius
chapter viii the veterans themselves can be happy since we have pronounced the word modest yand since we conceal nothing we ought to say that once nevertheless inspite of his ecstasies his urs ule caused him very serious grief
it was on one of the day sw hens he persuaded m
leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk
abris km ay breeze was blowing which swayed the crest soft he plain taint rees
the father and daughter armin arm had just passed marius ' bench
marius had risen to his feet behind the man dwa sfo llow in gthe mwi th his eyes as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul
all at once a gusto fwi nd more merry than the rest and probably charged with performing the affairs of springtime swept down from the nursery flung it self onthe all eye nve loped the young girl in a delicious shiver worthy of virgil 's nymphs and the fawns of the ocr it usa nd lifted her dress the robe more sacred than that of isis almost to the height of her garter
ale go fe xq uis it esha peap peared
marius saw it
he was exasperated and furious
the young girl had hastily thrust down her dress with a divinely trouble dmo tion but he was nonetheless angry for all that
he was alone in the alley it is true
but there might have been someone there
and what if the reha dbe enso me one there
can anyone comprehend such a thing
what she had just done is horrible
alas the poor child had done nothing there had been but one culprit the wind but marius in whom quivered the bar tho low hoe xis tsin cherub in was determined to be vexed and was jealous of his own shadow
it is thus in fact that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart and takes possession of it even without any right
moreover setting aside event hatje alou syth esi ght of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure
when his urs ule after having reached the end of the walk retraced her steps with m
leblanc and passed in front of the bench on which marius had seated himself once more marius darted as ull enan dfe rocio us glance at her
the young girl gave way to that slight straightening up with a backward movement accompanied by a raising of the eyelids which signifies well what is the matter
this was the irf irst quarrel
marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes when someone crossed the walk
it was a veteran very much bent extremely wrinkled and pale in a uniform of the louis xv
pattern bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth with the cross eds words the soldier 's cross of saint louis and adorned in addition with a coats lee vew hich had no arm with init with a silver china nda wooden leg
marius thought he perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air
it even struck him that the age dc yn icash eho bbl eda long past him address edt ohim avery fraternal and very merry win kast hough some chance had created an understanding between the man das thought he yha dsh are dso me piece of good luck together
what did that relic of mars mean by being so content ed
what had passed between that wooden leg and the other
marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy
perhaps he was the re
he said to himself perhaps he saw
and he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran
with the aid of time all points grow dull
marius ' wrath against urs ule just and legitimate as it was passed off
he finally pardoned her butt his cost him agreat effort he sulked for three days
nevertheless inspite of all this and because of all this his passion augmented and grew to madness
chapter ix eclipse there ader has just seen how marius discovered ortho ugh tth at hedis covered that she was named urs ule
appetite grows with loving
to know that he rna me was urs ule was a great deal itwas very little
in three or four weeks marius had devoured this bliss
he wanted another
he wanted to know where she lived
he had committed his first blunder by falling into the ambush of the bench by the gladiator
he had committed as econ dby not remaining at the luxembourg when m
leblanc came thither alone
he now committed at hird and an immense one
he followed urs ule
she lived in the rue de l' ouest in the most un frequent eds pot in an ew three story house of modest appearance
from that moment for thm arius added to his happiness of seeing her at the luxembourg the happiness of following her home
his hunger was increasing
he knew her first name atleast a charming name age nui new oman 's name he knew where she lived he wanted to know who she was
one evening after he had followed the mto the ird well in gand had seen the mdis appear through the carriage gate he entered in the irt rain and said boldly to the porter is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor who has just come in
no replied the porter
heist he gentleman on the third floor
another step gained
this success emboldened marius
onthe front
he asked
par bleu
said the porter the house is only built on the street
and what is that gentleman 's business
began marius again
he is a gentleman of property sir
avery kind man who does good to the unfortunate though not rich himself
what is his name
resume dma riu s
the porter raised his head and said are you apo lice spy sir
marius went off quite a bashed but delighted
he was getting on
good though the iknow that he rna me is urs ule that she is the daughter of agent leman who lives on his income and that she lives there on the third floor in the rue de l' ouest
onthe following day m
leblanc and his daughter made only avery briefs tay in the luxembourg the yw ent away while it was still broad daylight
marius followed the mto the rue de l' ouest as he had taken up the habit of doing
on arriving at the carriage entrance m
leblanc made his daughter pass in first then paused before crossing the threshold and stared in tently at marius
onthe next day they did not come to the luxembourg
marius waited for the mall day in vain
at night fall he went to the rue de l' ouest and saw a light in the windows ofthe third story
he walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished
the next day noone at the luxembourg
marius waited all day the nwe nta nd did sentinel duty under the irwin do ws
this carried him on to ten o'clock in the evening
his dinner to okc are of itself
fever nourishes the sick man and love the love r
he spent a week in this manner
m
leblanc nolonger appeared at the luxembourg
marius indulged in melancholy conjecture she dared not watch the port eco chere during the day he content ed himself with going at night to gaze upon the redlight of the windows
at times he saw shadows flit across the man dhis heart began to be at
onthe eighth day when he arrived under the windows there was no light in the m
hello
he said the lamp is not light ed yet
but it is dark
can they have gone out
he waited until ten o'clock
until midnight
until one in the morning
not alight appeared in the windows ofthe third story and noone entered the house
he went away in avery gloomy frame of mind
onthe morrow for he only existed from morrow tomorrow there was so to speak not oday for him on the morrow he found no one at the luxembourg he had expected this
at dusk he went to the house
no light in the windows the shades were drawn the third floor was totally dark
marius rapped at the port eco chere entered and said to the porter the gentleman on the third floor
has moved away replied the porter
marius reeled and said feebly how long ago
yesterday
where is heli ving now
id on ' tkn owa nyt hing about it
so he has not left his new address
no

he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the traps eek in gthe absent on eev ery where stupefied by love
on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him as in gular effect
hemet in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides amand res sed like a working man and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed agli mps eof locks of very white hair
marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation
strange to say he thought that he recognized m
leblanc
the hair was the same also the profile sofa rast he capper mitted aview of it the mien identical only more depressed
but why the sew orking man 's clothes
what was the meaning of this
what signified that disguise
marius was greatly astonished
when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold atlas tthe clue which he was seeking
in any case he must see the man near athan dan dc lear up the mystery
but the idea occurred to him to olate the man was nolonger the re
he had turned into some little sidestreet and marius could not find him
this encounter occupied his mind for three days and the nwa sef faced
after all he said to himself itwas probably only are semblance

everything is dear
the reis nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world
marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue saint jacques
he was walking along with drooping head
all at once he felt someone elbow him in the dusk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the one tall and slim the other alittle shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing the yha dbe encom in gto meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as the ypa ssed

marius had halted for a moment
he was about to pursue his way when his eye light edon alittle grayish package lying on the ground at his feet
he stooped and picked it up
it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers

onthe way he saw in an alley of the rue mou ffe tarda child 's coffin covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a candle
the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind
poor mother s
he thought
the reis one thing sadder than to see one 's children die itis to see the mle ading an evil life
the nth oses had ows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back on cem or ein to his habitual preoccupation s
he fell to thinking on cem or eof his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg
how gloomy mylife has become
he said to himself
younggirls are always appear in gto me only for me rly the yw ere angels and now they are ghouls
chapter iii quadri fron sth at evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to be dhis hand came in contact inthe pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard
he had forgotten it

he opened the envelope
it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed
the ybor ead dresses
all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco
the first was addressed to madame madame la marquise de gru cher ayth epl ace opposite the chamber of deputies no
marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety
it was conceived as follows madame la marquise the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely unit esso sie ty

no address was joined to the signature
marius hope dto find the address in the second letter whose superscript ion read amada me madame la comtesse de mont vernet rue cassette no
this is what marius read in it madame la comtesse it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old

in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect mistress bali zar d
marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the preceding here adm on sieur pab our geo telect or wholesale stocking merchant rue saint denis on the corner of the rue aux fers
i permit myself to address you this letter to be gyo uto grant me the pre tious favor of your sim pat ies and to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the theatre francais
the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style ithink is natural laconic and may have some merit

it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery
had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification
marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasant ry well and to lend him self to a game which the pavement of the streets eem edd esi rous of playing with him
it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man 's buff between the four letters and that the yw ere making sport of him
nothing however indicated that the sele tter sbe long edt othe two young girls who mma riu shad met on the boulevard

marius replaced the mint heir envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to be d

as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work
even when absent he left his key in the lock

the truth is however that he had one day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph of ma'am bou go n

marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl
chapter iv arose in misery illustration rose in misery bros ein misery avery young girl was standing in the half open door
the dormer window of the garrett hr ough which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figure with a wanli ght

marius had risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the form soft he shadows which traverse dreams
the most heartbreaking thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be home ly
in here arly childhood she must even have been pretty
the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty
the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter 's day
that face was not wholly unknown to marius
he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere
what do you wish mademoiselle
he asked
the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict here is a letter for you monsieur marius
she called marius by his name heco uld not doubt that he was the person who ms he wanted but who was this girl
how did she know his name
without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered
she entered resolutely staring with a sort of assurance that made the heart bleed at the whole room and the unmade be d
her feet were bare
large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her think nees
she was shivering
she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius
marius as he opened the letter notice dth at the enormous wafer which sealed it was still moist
the message could not have come from a distance

this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which had occupied marius ' thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar

he had been obliged more than once to pass the jon dre tte sin the corridor or on the stairs but the yw ere mere for mst ohim he had paid so little heed to the mth at onthe preceding evening he had jostled the jon dre tte girls on the boulevard without recognizing the mfor it had evidently been the yand it was with great difficulty that the one who had just enter ed his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity ava gue recollection of having met her elsewhere
now he saw everything clearly
he understood that his neighbor jon dre tte in his distress exercise dthe industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people who mhe judge dto be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughter sde live red atthe irri ska ndp eri lfor this father had come to such a pass that he risked his daughter she was playing a game with fate and he used the mast he stake
marius understood that probably judging from the irf light on the evening before from the irb re athl essco ndi tion from the irt error and from the words of slang which he had overheard the seun fortunate creatures were plying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constitute dtw omis erable being sw how eren either girls nor women as pec ies of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery
sadc re atures without name or sexo rage to whom neither good nor evil were any longer possible and who one merging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue nor responsibility

nevertheless while marius be ntap aine dan das to nished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garret with the audacity of aspect re
she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness
occasionally he rch emis ewh ich was untied and to rnf ella lmos tto her waist
she moved the chair sabo uts hedis arranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius ' clothes she rummaged about to see what the rewa sin the corner s

said she youhave amir ror
and she hummed scraps of vaudeville sast hough she had been alone frolics omer efrain sw hich her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious
an indescribable constraint weariness and humiliation were perceptible beneath this hardihood
effrontery is a disgrace
nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak flit with the movement sofa bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing
one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and over free mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming
never even among animals does the creature born to be a dove change in to an osprey
that is only to be seen among men
marius reflected and allowed her to have her way
she approached the table
ah
said she books

she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible iknow howto read id o
she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with tolerable fluency general baud uin received orders to take the chateau of hou go mon twh ich stands in the middle of the plain of waterloo with five battalion so fhi sbri gade

she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed and iknow howto write to o
she dipped her pen in the ink and turning to marius do you want to see
look here i'm going to write a word to show you
and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of whitepaper which lay in the middle of the table the bobbie sare here

the nsh escr uti nized marius assumed as in gular air and said do you know mr

and atthe same moment the same idea occurred to the mbo than dma de her smile and him blush
she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder you pay no heed to me but i know you mr

it is very becoming to you to have your hair tumbled thus
she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very deep
apo rti on of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing
marius had retreated gently
mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity ihave here apac kage which belongs to you ithink
permit me to return it to you
and he held out the envelope containing the four letters
she clapped her hands and exclaimed wehave been looking everywhere for that
the nsh eea ger lys e ized the package and opened the envelope saying ass he did so die uded ie u

if you are not satisfied dogs burst
this reminded marius of the wretched girl 's errand to himself
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there
the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius ' presence
i often go off in the evening
sometimes i do n't come home again
last winter before we came here we live dun der the arches of the bridge s
we huddled together to keep from freezing
my little sister cried

this was all he owned in the world for the moment
at all events het hough tthe reis my dinner for today and tomorrow we will see
he kept the sixteen sousa nd handed the five francs to the young girl

chapter vapro vide ntia lp eep hole marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not know nre al misery

it was its spectre which had just passed before his eyes
infact he who has only be held the misery of man has seen nothing them is ery of woman is what he must see he who has seen on lyth emis ery of woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child

how pale the yare
how cold they are
it seems as though the ydw elt in a planet much further from the sun than ours
this young girl was to marius as orto fme ssen ger from the real mof sad shadows
she revealed to him a hideous side of the night
marius almost reproached him self forth epr eoc cup ations of rever yand passion which had prevented his best owing a glance on his neighbors upto that day
the payment of the irre nth adbe ename chanical movement which anyone would have yielded to but he marius should have done better than that

and the nsh ould not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great
while reading himself this moral lesson for the re were occasions on which marius like all truly honest heart swash is own pedagogue and scolded him self more than he deserved he stared at the wall which separated him from the jon dre tte sast hough hewer eab let omake his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warmth ese wretched people
the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished
only amana sdr eam yasm arius could have failed to perceive this long before
the rewa sno paper past edon the wall either on the side of the jon dre tte so ron that of marius the coarse construction was visible in its nakedness
marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes rever ye xa mines observe sands crut in izes as though two uld
all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceiling at rian gular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes
the plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode aview could be had through this aperture into the jon dre tte s ' attic
commiseration has an dsh ould have its curiosity
this aperture for me das or to fpe eph ole
it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it
let us get some little idea of what the sep eople are like thought marius and in what condition they are
he climbed up on the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked
chapter vi the wild man in his lair cities like forests have the irc ave rns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which the yc on tain conceal the mse lve s
only in cities that which thus conceals itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly info rest sth at which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is to say beautiful
taking one lair with another the beast 's is preferable to the man 's
caverns are better than hovels
what marius now beheld was a hovel
marius was poor and his chamber was poverty stricken but as his poverty was noble his garret was neat
the den upon which his eye now rested was abject dirty fetid pest if ero us means or did
the only furniture consisted of astra wcha iran in firm tables omeo ldb its of crockery and in two of the corner st woi ndes crib able pallets all the light was furnished by a dormer window of four panes draped with spiders ' web s
through this aperture the rep enet rated just enough light to make the face of amana ppe a rli ket he face of apha nto m
the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and scars like a visa gedi sfi gure dby some horrible malady are puls ive moisture exuded from the m
obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon the m
the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled nor plan kedit sinha bit an tss tep ped directly on the antique plaster of the hovel which had grown black under the long continued pressure of feet
upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly in crusted and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously group edco nst ella tions of old shoes socks and repulsive rags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty francs aye a r
the rewa sever yso rto ft hing in that fireplace abra zie rap otb roken boards rags suspended from nails abi rdc age ashes and even alittle fire
two brands were smouldering the reina melancholy way
one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that it was large
it had projections and angles and black holes the lower side so fro of sba ysa ndp rom onto ries
hence horrible unfathomable nooks where it seemed as though spiders as big as one 's fist wood lice as large as one 's foot and perhaps even who knows
some monstrous human beings must be hiding
one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window
one end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius
in acorn erne art heap ert ure through which marius was gazing a colored engraving in a black frame was suspended to an ai lon the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription the dream
this represented as lee ping woman and a child also asleep the child on the woman 's lap an eagle in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the crown away from the child 's head with out awaking the latter in the background napoleon in a glory leaning on avery blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription marin go auster lit siena wagram me elo tbe neath this frame as orto fw ood en panel which was nolonger than it was broad st ood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall
it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall of a frame probably showing a daub on the other side of some pier glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten the re while waiting to be re hung
near the table upon which marius descried ape nin kand papers at amana bouts i xt yy ears of age small thin livid haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air ahi de ous scoundrel

this man had along gray beard
he was clad in a woman 's chemise which allowed his hair yb re asta nd his bare arms bristling with gray hair to be seen
beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which his toes project ed were visible
he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking
the rewa snob read in the hovel but there was still tobacco
he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had read
onthe corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique moo fread in grooms betrayed aroma nce
onthe covers pra wle dthe following title printed in large capital sgod the king honor and the ladies by duc ray dum in il
as the man wrote he talked aloud and marius heard his words the idea that the reis no equality even when you are dead

he paused smote the table with his fist and added as he ground his teeth oh
ico uld eat the whole world
abi gwo man who might be for ty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace on her bare heels
she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth
acoa rse line nap ronco ncea led the half of her petticoat
although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature
she was a sort of giant beside her husband
she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with the irf lat nails
beside her on the floor wide open lay abook of the same for mast he other and probably a volume of the same romance
on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening or seeing or living
no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age
on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen
she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted
she was of that puny sort which remains backward for along time the nsu dde nly start supra pid ly
it is indigence which produces the semel ancho lyh uman plants
the secre atures have neither childhood nor youth
at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen the ys eem twenty

one might say that the yst ride through life in order to get through with it the more speedily
at this moment this being had the air of a child
moreover not race of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft no spinning wheel not at ool
in one corner lays ome ironmongery of dubious aspect
it was the dull listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony
marius gazed for awhile at this gloomy interior more terrifying than the interior of atom bfor the human soul could be felt fluttering the rea nd life was palpitating the re
the garrett he cellar the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber but as the wealthy display the irg re ates tma gni fice ncea tthe entrance of the irpa laces its eem sth at death which stands directly side by side with the mpla ces its greatest miseries in that vestibule
the man held his peace the woman spoke now or dthe young girl did not even seem to breathe
the scratching of the pen on the paper was audible
the man grumbled without pausing in his writing
can ail le
can ail le
everybody is can ail le
this variation to solomon 's exclamation elicited a sigh from the woman
calm yourself my little friends he said
don't hurt yourself my dear
you are too good to write to all those people husband
bodies press close to eachother in misery as in cold but heart sdr a wap art
this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging from the amount of love with in her but probably in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group this had become extinct
the reno longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband
nevertheless caressing appellation shad survived as is often the case
she called him my dear my little friend my good man etc
with her mouth while he rhea rtw as silent
the man resume dhis writing
chapter vii strategy and tactics marius with a load up on his breast was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post
the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly
the eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold
on her feet she had large coarse men 's shoes be spattered with mud which had splashed event oh erred ankles and she was wrapped in an old man tle which hung in tatters
marius had not seen it on her an hour previously but she had probably deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity and had picked it up again on emerging
she entered pushed the door to be hind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless the nex claimed with an expression of triumph and joy he is coming
the father turned his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the little sister did not stir

the child with a sort of terrified obedience rose on tiptoe and struck a pane with her fist

he was grave and abrupt

the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fist without quitting the corner in which she was cowering
she had wounded herself while breaking the windows he went off near her mother 's pallet and we pts ile ntl y

marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes

he beheld her again atlas taft erh aving sought her solo ng

what does he think i can do with his five francs
that won ' tpa ym eform ych air and pane of glass
that 's what comes of incurring expenses
in the meanwhile m
leblanc had removed the large brown great coat which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the chair

leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had turned towards the door
farewell until this evening my friends
said he
six o'clock
said jon dre tte
six o'clock precisely
at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder jon dre tte girl
you are forgetting your coats irs aids he
jon dre tted art edan annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders

leblanc turned back and said with a smile ihave not forgotten it iam leaving it

leblanc put on this coat

he has til yd on ned the brown great coat
and all three went out jon dre tte preceding the two strangers
chapter xta riff of licensed cabs two francs an hour marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing
his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly envelope dhe rfr omt he moment of her very first step in that garret
during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspend sma terial perceptions and precipitate sthe whole soul on asin gle point
he contemplated not that girl butt hat light which wore a satin peli sse and a velvet bonnet
the stars iri us might have entered the room and he would not have been anymore dazzled
while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets question in gthe sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words
he knew her eyes her brow herbeau tyhe rfor mhe rwal khe did not know the sound of her voice
he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact
he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might be a raw ayin his soul alittle of that music
but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamation sand trumpet bursts of jon dre tte
this added at ouch of genuine wrath to marius ' ecstasy
he devoured her with his eyes
he could not believe that it really was that divine creature who mhe saw in the midst of those vile creatures in that monstrous lair
it seemed to him that he beheld a hummingbird in the midst of toads
when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again atleast after having so miraculously rediscovered her
he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat
as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of opening it as ud den reflection caused him to pause
the corridor was long the staircase steep jon dre tte was talkative m
leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage if on turning round in the corridor or on the staircase hewer et oca tch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final
what was he todo
should he wait alittle
but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off
marius was perplexed
atlas the accepted the risk and quitted his room
the rewa sno one in the corridor
he has ten edt othe stairs
the rewa sno one on the staircase
he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see a fiac returning the corner of the rue du petit ban quiero nits wayback to paris
marius rushed headlong in that direction
on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fia creag ain rapidly descending the rue mou ffe tard the carriage was already a long way of fan dthe re was no means of overtaking it what
run after it
impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly not ice an individual running at full speed in pursuit of a fiac re andthe father would recognize him
at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck marius perceived an empty cab passing along the boulevard
the rewa sbu to nething to be done to jump into this caban dfo llow the fia cre
that was sure efficacious and free from danger
marius made the driver as i gnt oh alta ndc all edt ohim by the hour
marius wore no cravath ehad on his work in gco at which was destitute of buttons his shirt was to rna long one of the plaits on the bosom
the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb
what is it
said marius
pay in advance said the coachman
marius recollected that he had but sixteen sousa bout him
how much
hedeman de d
for tys ous
iwill pay on my return
the driver 's only reply was to whistle the air of lapa lisse and to whip up his horse
marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air
for the lack of four and twenty sous he was losing his joy his happiness his love
he had seen and he was becoming blind again
here flected bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five francs which he had bestowed that very morning on that miserable girl
if he had had those five francs he would have been saved he would have been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed state hemi ght have re knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread which had just float ed before his eyes and had broken at the same instant once more
here turned to his hovel in despair
he might have to ldh ims elf that m
leblanc had promised to return in the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully so that he might follow him on that occasion but in his contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this
as he was on the point of mounting the staircase he perceived on the other side of the boulevard near the desert edwall skirting the rue de la barrier edes gobelins jon dre tte wrapped in the philanthropist 's great coat engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent prowler soft he barriers people of equivocal face of suspicious monologues who present the air of having evil minds and who generally sleep in the daytime which suggests the supposition that the yw or kb yn ight
the set women standing there motionless and in conversation in the snow which was falling in whirlwind sfor med agro up that apo lice man would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed
still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom jon dre tte was talking resembled a certain pancha udal iasp rint an ier alias big renai llew hom cour fey racha do ncep oint edo utt ohim as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer

chapter xi offers of service from misery to wretchedness marius ascended the stairs of the hovel with slow steps at the moment when he was about to reenter his cell he caught sight of the elder jon dre tte girl following him through the corridor
the very sight of this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was too late to demand the mba ckt he cab was nolonger the re the fia crew as far away
moreover she would not have given the mba ck
as for questioning her about the residence of the person sw hoh adjust beenthere that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the letters ign edfa ban to uha dbe en address edt othe benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques duh aut pas
marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him
it did not close het urn ed round and beheld a hand which he ldt he door half open

he asked who is the re
it was the jon dre tte girl
is it you

she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him
she nolonger had the air of assurance which had characterized her that morning
she did not enter but he ldb ack in the darkness of the corridor where marius could see her through the half open door
come now will you answer
cried marius
what do you want with me
she raised her dull eyes in which as orto fgl eam seemed to flicker vaguely and said monsieur marius you look sad
what is the matter with you

said marius

is that what you want
she demanded
yes
do you know the m
no
that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know her but you wish to know her
this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it
well can you do it
said marius

she dropped her head the nwi tha brusque movements he pulled to the door which closed behind her
marius found himself alone
he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed absorbed in thought sw hich he could not grasp and as though apr ey to vertigo
all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his brain confused ly
all at once he was violently aroused from his rever y

the father of his urs ule
what
did jon dre tte know him
was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him
was he about to learn atlas twh oit was that he loved who that you ng girl was
who he rfa the rwa s
was the dense shadow which en wrapped them on the point of being dispelled
was the veil about to be rent
ah
heaven s
he bounded rather than climbed up on his commode and resume dhis post near the little peephole in the partition wall
again he beheld the interior of jon dre tte 's hovel
chapter xii the use made of m
leblanc 's five franc piece nothing in the aspect of the family was altered except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets
two new blankets were thrown across the two beds
jon dre tte had evidently just returned
he still had the breathlessness of out of doors
his daughter swer esea ted on the floor near the fireplace the elder engaged in dressing the younger 's wounded hand
his wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative of astonishment
jon dre tte was pacing up and down the garret with long strides
his eyes were extraordinary
the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband turned to say what really
you are sure

eighty ears have passed
but i recognize him

he paused and said to his daughter sge to uto fhe re you
it 's queer that it did n't strike you

the mother stammered with her injured hand

it was plain that this man was ofthe sort to whom no one of ferst or epl y
the two girls departed
atthe moment when the yw ere about to passthrough the door the father detained the elder by the armand said to her with a peculiar accent you will be here at five o'clock precisely
both of you
is hall need you
marius redoubled his attention
on being left alone with his wife jon dre tte began to pace the room again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence
the nhes pen tse vera lmi nut esi ntuc king the lower part of the woman 's chemise which he wore into his trousers
all at once he turned to the female jon dre tte folded his arms and exclaimed and would you like to have met elly ous ome thing
the young lady well what
retorted his wife they oung lady
marius could not doubt that it was really she of whom the yw eres peaking
he listened with a rde nta nxi et y
his whole life was in his ears
but jon dre tte had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper
the nhes trai ght ened himself up and concluded aloud it is she
that one
said his wife
that very ones aid the husband
no expression can reproduce the significance of the mother 's words
surprise rage hate wrath were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation
the pronunciation of a few words the name nod ou btw hich her husband had whispered in here arh ads uffi ced to rouse this huge somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible
it is not possible
she cried
when it hink that my daughter sare going barefoot and have not ago wnt othe irb acks
what
as a tin peli sse ave lve tbo nne tbo otsa nde very thing more than two hundred francs ' worth of clothes
so that one would think she was a lady
no you are mistaken
why inthe first place the other was hideous and this one is not so bad looking
she really is not bad looking
it can ' tbe she
it elly out hat it is she
you will see
at this absolute assertion the jon dre tte woman raised her large red blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression
at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her husband
she was a sow with the look of a tigress
what
she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who gazed at my daughter swith an air of pity she is that beggar brat
oh
is hould like to kick her stomach info rhe r
she sprang of fof the bed and remained standing for a moment he rhai rindi so rder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists clenched and drawn back
the nsh efe llb ack on the bed once more
the man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female
after a silence lasting several minutes heap proach edt he female jon dre tte and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done a moment before and shall it elly oua not her thing
what is it
she asked
he answered in a low curt voice my fortune is made
the woman stared at him with the look that signifies is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad
he went on thunder
it was not so very long ago that iwasa parishioner of the parish of die of hunger ifyou have a fire die of cold ifyou have bread

he took a turn round the hovel and added like other people
what do you mean by that
asked the woman
he shook his head winked screwed up on eeye and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration what do i mean by that
listen
hush
muttered the woman not so loud
the sea re matters which must not be overheard
bah
who 's here
our neighbor
is a whim go out alittle while ago
besides he does n't listen the big boob y
and it elly out hat is a whim go out
nevertheless by a sort of instinct jon dre tte lowered his voice although not sufficiently to prevent marius hearing his words
one favorable circumstance which enabled marius not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard
this is what marius heard listen carefully
the croesus is caught or as good as caught
that 's all settled already
everything is arranged
ihave seen some people
he will come here this evening at six o'clock
to bring sixty francs the rascal
did you notice how iplay edt hat game on him my sixty francs mylan dlo rdm yf our tho ffe bru ary
id on ' tev en owe for one quarter
isn't he afo ol
so he will come at six o'clock
that 's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner
mother bou go niso ff washing dishes in the city
the re 's not as oul in the house
the neighbor never comes home until eleven o'clock
the children shall stand on watch
you shall help us
he will give in
and what if he does not give in
demanded his wife
jon dre tte made as in ister gesture and said we 'll fix him
and he burst out laughing
this was the first time marius had seen him laugh
the laugh was cold and sweet and provoked a shudder
jon dre tte opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from it an old cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve
now said he i'm going out
ihave some more people that i must see
good ones
you 'll see how well the whole thing will work
is hall be away as short atime as possible it'sa finest roke of business do you look after the house
and with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers he stood for a moment in thought the nex claimed do you know it 's mighty lucky by the way that he did n't recognize me
if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back again
he would have slipped through our fingers
it was my beard that saved us
my romantic beard
my pretty little romantic beard
and again he broke into a laugh
he stepped to the window
the snow was still falling and streaking the gray ofthe sky
what beastly weather
said he
the nla pping his overcoat across his breast this rindi stool arg eform e
nevermind head de dhe did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel
if it had n't been for that i could n't have gone out and everything would have gone wrong
what small points things hang on any way
and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quit ted the room
he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made it sapp ear an ceo nce more in the opening
icam enea rfor getting said he
you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready
and he flung into his wife 's apron the five franc piece which the philanthropist had left with him
abra zie rof charcoal
asked his wife
yes
how many bushels
two good ones
that will come to thirty sous
with the rest iwill buy something for dinner

at this word from his wife jon dre tte closed the door again and this time marius heard his step die away in the corridor of the hovel and descend the staircase rapidly
at that moment one o'clock struck from the church of saint medard
chapter xiii solus cum solo in loco remoto non co gita bunt uro rare paternoster marius dreamer as he was was a swe have said firm and energetic by nature

not one of the enigma sw hich he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated on the contrary all of the mha dbe en rendered more dense if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the luxembourg and the man who mhec all edm

he scanned the female jon dre tte for a moment
she had pulled an old sheet irons to vef roma corner and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron
he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to make the least noise
amid his terror as to what was in preparation and in the horror with which the jon dre tte shadi nspire dhi mhe experience das or to fj oya tthe idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one who mhe love d

he did not know the ira ddress
the yha drea ppe are dfor an instant before his eyes and had the npl ung ed back again into the immense depth so fpa ris
should he wait for m
leblanc at the door that evening at six o'clock at the moment of his arrival and warn him of the trap
but jon dre tte and his men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely the yw eres trong erth an het hey would devise means to seize him or to get him away and the man who mma riu swa san xio us to save would be lost
one o'clock had just struck the trap was to be sprung at six
marius had five hours before him
the rewa sbu to nething to be done
he put on his decent coat knotted as i lkh and kerchief round his neck to ok his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with barefeet
moreover the jon dre tte woman continued to rummage among her old iron
once outside of the house he made for the rue du petit ban qui er
he had almost reached the middle of this street near avery low wall which aman can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he heard voices talking very close by
he turned his head the street was deserted the rewa snot as oul in it itwas broad daylight and yet he distinctly heard voices
it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting
the rein facts at two men flat on the snow with the irb acks against the wall talking together in subdued to nes
the set wop erson swer estrange rst ohim one was a bearded man in a blouse and the other along haired individual in rags
the bearded man had on a fez the other 's head was bare and the snow had lodged in his hair
by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear the irre marks
the hair yon ejo gge dthe other man 's elbow and said with the assistance of patron minette it can ' tfa il
do you think so
said the bearded man
and the longhaired one began again it'sa sgo oda saw a rra nt foreach one of five hundred balls and the worst that can happen is five years six years ten years at the most
the other replied with some hesitation and shivering beneath his fez that 's area lth in g
you can ' tgo against such things
it elly out hat the affair can ' tgo wrong resume dthe longhaired man
father what 's his name 's team will be already harnessed
the nth ey began to discuss am elo drama that the yha dse enon the preceding evening at the gait ethe at re
marius went his way
it seemed to him that the mysterious words of the semen so strangely hidden behind that walland crouching in the snow could not but bears omer elation to jon dre tte 's abominable projects
that must be the affair
he directed his course towards the faubourg saint marceau and asked at the first shop heca met ow here he could find a commissary of police
he was directed to rue de pontoise no
thither marius betook himself
as he passed a baker 's shop hebo ugh tat wop en ny rolland at eitf or ese ein gth at hes hould not dine
onthe way here nder ed justice to provide nce
here flected that had he not given his five francs to the jon dre tte girl in the morning he would have followed m
leblanc 's fiac re and consequently have remained ignorant of everything and that the re would have been no obstacle to the trap of the jon dre tte sand that m
leblanc would have been lost and his daughter with him no doubt
chapter xiv in which apo lice agent best ows two fistful sonal a wyer on arriving at no
rue de pontoise he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police
the commissary of police is not here said acle rkb utt here is an inspector who takes his place
would you like to speak to him
are you in haste
yes said marius
the clerk introduced him into the commissary 's office
the rest ood at all man behind a grating leaning against a stove and holding up with both hands the tail sofa vast to pc oat with three collars
his face was square with a thin firm mouth thick gray and very ferocious whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pocket sins ideo ut
of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but that it searched
this man 's air was not much less ferocious nor less terrible than jon dre tte 's the dog is a tti me sn oles ster rib let ome et than the wolf
what do you want
he said to marius without adding monsieur
is this monsieur le commissaire depo lice
he is absent
iam here in his stead
the matter is very private
the nspe a k
and great haste is required
the nspe a kq uic k
this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time
he inspired fear and confidence
marius related the adventure to him that apers on with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight was to be in vei gle dint oat rap that very evening that as he occupied the room adjoining the den he marius pont mercy ala wyer had heard the whole plot through the partition that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain jon dre tte that the re would be accomplices probably some prowler soft he barriers among others acer tain pancha udal iasp rint an ier alias big renai lle that jon dre tte 's daughter swer etol ie in wait that the rewa snow ayo fwa rning the threatened man since he did not even know his name and that finally all this was to be carried out at six o'clock that evening at the most deserted point of the boulevard de l' hopital inhouse no
atthe sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said coldly so it is in the room at the end of the corridor
precisely answered marius and head de dare you acquainted with that house
the inspector remained silent for a moment the nre plied as he warmed the heel of his boot at the door of the stove apparently
he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so much as his cravat patron minette must have had a hand in this
this words truck marius
patron minette said he id id heart hat word pronounced in fact
and here peated to the inspector the dialogue between the longhaired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du petit ban qui er
the inspector muttered the longhaired man must be brujo nand the bearded one demi liar dalia sde uxm illia rds
he had dropped his eyelids again and became a bs or bed in thought

this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at him intently the while are you afraid
of what
said marius
ofthese men
no more than yourself
retorted marius rudely who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him
the inspectors tare dst ill more intently at marius and continued with sent ent ious solemnity the rey ous peak like a brave man and like an honest man
courage does not fear crime and honesty does not fear authority
marius interrupted him that is well but what do you intend to do
the inspector content ed himself with the remark the lodge rsh ave passkey swith which to get in a tni ght
you must have one
yes said marius
have you it about you

marius to ok his key from his waistcoat pocket handed it to the inspector and added ifyou will take my advice you will come in force
the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on apr ovi ncia lac adem icia nw hoh a dsu gge ste dar hym etoh im with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the two immense pocket so fhist opc oat and pulled out two small steel pistols of the sort called knock me down s

marius had infact seen jon dre tte passing along the rue mou ffe tarda nd was spying on his proceedings
jon dre tte walked straight ahead with out as us pic ion that he was already held by a glance
he quit ted the rue mou ffe tarda ndma riu ssa whim enter one of the most terrible hovels in the rue gracie use here maine dthe re about aqua rte rof an hour the nre turned to the rue mou ffe tard
he halted at an ironmonger 's shop which the nst ood at the corner of the rue pierre lombard and a few minutes later marius saw him emerge from the shop holding in his hand ahu gec old chisel with a white wood handle which he concealed beneath his great coat
atthe to po fthe rue petit gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the rue du petit ban qui er
the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again
marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the rue du petit ban qui erw hich was deserted asus ual and did not follow jon dre tte into it
it was lucky that he did so for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the longhaired man and the bearded man conversing jon dre tte turned round made sure that noone was following him did not see him the nspr an gac ross the wall and disappeared
the wasteland bordered by this wall communicate dwi tht he backyard of an ex live rys table keeper of bad repute who had failed and who still kept a few old single seat ed berlin sunder his sheds
marius thought that it would be wise to profit by jon dre tte 's absence to return home moreover it was growing late every evening ma'am bou go nw hens he set out for her dishwashing into wn had a habit of locking the door which was always closed at dusk
marius had given his key to the inspector of police itwas important therefore that he should make haste
evening had arrived night had almost closed in onthe horizon and in the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun and that was the moon
it was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low dome of sal petrie re
marius returned to no
with great strides
the door was still open when he arrived
he mounted the stairs on tiptoe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber
this corridor as the reader will remember was bordered on both sides by attic sall of which were for the moment empty and to let
ma'am bou go nwa sin the habit of leaving all the doors open
as he passed on eof the seat tics marius thought he perceived in the uninhabited cell them oti o nle ssh eads of four men vaguely light edu pby are mna nto fda yli ght falling through a dormer window
marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself
he succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise
it was high time
amo men tla ter hehe ard ma'am bou go nta keh erde part ure locking the door of the house behind her

it might have been half past five o'clock
only half an hour separate dhi mfr om what was about to happen
hehe ard the beating of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark
he thought of the double march which was going on a tth at moment in the dark crime advancing on one side justice coming up on the other
he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place
asist he case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream and inorder to persuade him self that he was not the pre yof an ight mar eheh adt of eel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pocket s
it was nolonger snowing the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen communicate dto the chamber as orto ft wil ight aspect

marius saw the hole in the walls hin in gwi thar eddi shg low which seemed blood yto him
it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle
however there was not as ound in the jon dre tte quarter snot as oul was moving the reno tas oul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and profound and had it not been for that light hemi ght have thought himself next door to as epu lch re
marius softly removed his boots and pushed the munder his bed
several minutes elapsed
marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the latch of the hovel was noisily lifted it was jon dre tter et urn in g
instantly several voices arose
the whole family was in the garret
only it had been silent in the master 's absence like wolf whelp sin the absence of the wolf
it 's is a idh e

all ready to go out
don't for get what it old you

resteasy
because said jon dre tte
and he left the phrase unfinished
marius heard him lay something heavy on the table probably the chisel which he had purchased
by the way said jon dre tte have you been eating here
yes said the mother
i got three large potatoes and some salt
it ook advantage of the fire to cook the m

you shall dine like charles the tenth all is going well
the nhe added the mousetrap is open

he lowered his voice still further and said put this inthe fire
marius heard as ound of charcoal being knocked with the tongs or some iron utensil and jon dre tte continued have you greased the hinges of the doors otha tthe yw ill not squeak
yes replied the mother
what time is it
nearly six
the half hours truck from saint medard awhile ago

ejaculated jon dre tte the children must go and watch

a whispering ensued
jon dre tte 's voice became a udi ble again has old bou go nle ft
yes said the mother
are you sure that the reis noone in our neighbor 's room
he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his dinner hour
you are sure

all the same said jon dre tte the re 's no harm in going to see whether he is the re
here my girl take the candle and got here
marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed
hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived alight through the crack of his door
p ' pac ried a voice he is not in here
here cogni zed the voice of the eldest daughter
did you go in
demanded her father
no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out
the father exclaimed goin nevertheless
the door opened and marius saw the tall jon dre tte come in with a candle in her hand
she was a ssh ehad been in the morning only still more repulsive in this light
she walked straight up to the bed
marius endured a nin describable moment of anxiety but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps
she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it
in the neighboring room the sound of iron articles being moved was audible
she smoothed her hair with the palm of her hand and smiled into the mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice no sam our son tdu re toute une semaine mais que du bonheur les instant sso ntc our ts

let em psd esa mou rsd eva it durer toujours

in the meantime marius trembl ed
it seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing
she stepped to the window and looked out with the half foolish ways he had
how ugly paris is when it has put on a white chemise
said she
she returned to the mirror and began again to put on air sbe for eit scrutinizing herself full face and three quarters face in turn
well
cried he rfa the rwh at a rey oua bout the re
iam looking under the bed and the furniture she replied continuing to arrange her hair there 's no one here

yelled her father

she hummed vous me quit te zp our all eral a glo irem on triste coeur sui vra part out
she cast apart in ggl an cei nthe mirror and went out shutting the door behind her
amo mentmore and marius heard the sound of the two young girls ' barefeet in the corridor and jon dre tte 's voice shouting to the mpa yst ric the ed
one on the side of the barrier the other atthe corner of the rue du petit ban qui er
don't loses ight for a moment of the door of this house and the moment you see anything rush here on the instant
as hard as you can go
you have a key to get in
the eldest girl grumbled the idea of standing watch in the snow barefoot
tomorrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots
said the father
the yr and owns tair sand afew seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announce dth at the yw ere outside
the reno wre maine dint he house only marius the jon dre tte sand probably also the mysterious persons of whom marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic
chapter xvii the use made of marius ' five franc piece marius decided that the moment had no war rived when he must resume his post a this observatory
in a twinkling and with the agility of his age he had reached the hole in the partition
he looked
the interior of the jon dre tte apartment presented a curious as pect and marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed
aca nd lewa sbu rning in a candlestick covered with verdigris but that was not what really light edt he chamber
the hovel was completely illuminated as it were bythe reflection from a rather large sheet iron brazier standing in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal the brazier prepared by the jon dre tte woman that morning
the charcoal was glowing hot and the brazier was re dab lue flame flickered over it and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchase dby jon dre tte in the rue pierre lombard where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat
in one corner near the door and as though prepared for some definite use two heaps were visible which appeared to be the one ah eap of old iron theother a heap of ropes
all this would have caused the mind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation to waver between avery sinister and avery simple idea
the lair thus light edu pm or eres embl eda for get hana mouth of hell but jon dre tte in this light had rather the air of a demon than of a smith
the heat of the brazier was so great that the candle on the table was melting on the side next the chafing dish and was drooping over
an old dark lantern of copper worthy of diogenes turned cartouches to odon the chimney piece
the brazier place dint he fireplace itself beside the nearly extinct brands sent it sva por su pthe chimney and gave out nood or
the moon entering through the four panes of the window cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garret and to the poetics piri to fma riu sw how asd ream ye veni nthe moment of action itwas like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth
abre at hof air which made it sway in through the open pane helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier
the jon dre tte lair was ifthe reader recalls what we have said of the go rbe a ubu il ding admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed and as the envelope for a crime
it was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in paris
if the system of ambush and traps had not already existed they would have been invented the re
the whole thickness of a house and am ulti tude of uninhabited rooms separate dth is den from the boulevard and the only window that existed opened on wasteland sen closed with walls and palisades
jon dre tte had lighted his pipe seated himself on the seat less chair and was engaged in smoking
his wife was talking to him in a low to ne
if marius had been cour fey ract hat is to say one of those men who laugh one very occasion in life he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the jon dre tte woman
she had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the herald sata rms at the coronation of charles x
anim mens eta rta nsh a wl over her knitted petticoat and the man 's shoes which he rda ugh ter had scorned in the morning
it was this toilette which had extracted from jon dre tte the exclamation good
you have dressed up
you have done well
you must inspire confidence
as for jon dre tte he had not take no fft he news urt out which was too large for him and which m
leblanc had given him and his costume continued to present that contrast of coat and trousers which constitute dthe ideal of a poet in cour fey rac 's eyes
all at once jon dre tte lifted up his voice bythe way
now that it hink of it
in this weather he will come in a carriage
light the lantern take it and god own stairs
you will stand behind the lower door
the very moment that you hear the carriage stop you will open the door instantly he will come up you will light the staircase and the corridor and when he enters her eyo uwi llg odo wns tair saga in a sspe edi lya spo ssi bley ou will pay the coachman and dismiss the fia cre

jon dre tte fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five francs
what 's this
she exclaimed
jon dre tter epl ie dwi thd ign it yth at isthe monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning
and head de ddo you know what
two chairs will be needed here
what for
to sit on
marius felt a cold chill passthrough his limbs at hearing this mild answer from jon dre tte
pardi eu
i'll go and get one of our neighbor 's
and with a rapid movement she opened the door of the dena nd went out into the corridor
marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode reach his bed and conceal himself beneath it
take the candle cried jon dre tte
no said she it would embarrass me ihave the two chairs to carry
the reis moonlight
marius heard mother jon dre tte 's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark
the door opened
here maine dna ile d to the spot with the shock and with horror
the jon dre tte entered
the dormer window permitted the entrance of a ray of moonlight between two blocks of shadow
one of the sebl ock so fsh ado went irel yc over edt he wall against which marius was leaning so that he disappeared within it
mother jon dre tter aise dhe reyes did not seem arius to okt he two chairs the only one sw hich marius possessed and went away letting the door fall heavily to be hind her
she reentered the lair
here are the two chairs
and here is the lantern
god own as quick as you can
she has til yob eyed and jon dre tte was left alone
he placed the two chairs on opposite side soft he table turned the chisel in the brazier set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing dish then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope and bent down as though to examine something
marius the nrec ognized the fact that what he had taken for a shapeless mass was avery well made rope ladder with wooden run gsa ndt woh ooks with which to attach it
this ladder and some large tools veritable masses of iron which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door had not been in the jon dre tte hovel in the morning and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon during marius ' absence
those are the utensils of an edge to olm aker thought marius
had marius been alittle more learned in this line he would have recognized in what he took for the engine sofa ned get ool make rce rtai nin strum ents which will force al ock or pick a lock and other sw hich will cut or slice the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and fau chants
the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius
the brazier being concealed the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney piece cast a large shadow
the rewa sso meth in gin describ ably calm threatening and hideous about this chamber
one felt that the re existed in it the anticipation of something terrible
jon dre tte had allowed his pipe to go out as eri ous sign of preoccupation and had again seated himself
the candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance
he indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfolding soft her ight hand as though he were responding to the last counsel sofas ombre inward monologue
in the course of one of the sedar kre plies which he was making to himself he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him to oko uta long kitchen knife which was concealed the rea ndt ried the edge of its blade on his nail
that done he put the knife back in the drawer and shut it
marius on his side grasped the pistol in his right pocket drew it out and cocked it
the pistol emitted as harp clear click ashe cocked it
jon dre tte started half rose listened am omen tthe nbe gant ola ugh and said what a fool iam
it 's the partition cracking
marius kept the pistol in his hand
chapter xviii marius ' two chairs for mavis avis suddenly the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the panes
six o'clock was striking from saint medard
jon dre tte marked off each stroke with a toss of his head
when the sixth had struck he snuffed the candle with his fingers
the nhe began to pace up and down the room listened at the corridor walked on again the nlist ened once more
provided only that he comes
he muttered the nhe returned to his chair
he had hardly reseat ed himself when the door opened
mother jon dre tte had opened it and now remained in the corridor making a horrible amiable grimace which one of the holes of the dark lantern illuminated from below

m
leblanc made his appearance
he wore a nair of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable
he laid four louis onthe table

wewill attend to the rest hereafter

said jon dre tte
and rapidly approaching his wife dismiss the carriage
she slipped out while he rhus band was lavishing salutes and offering m
leblanc acha ir
an instant later she returned and whispered in his ear ' tis done
the snow which had not ceased falling since the morning was so deep that the arrival of the fia cre had not been audible and the ydi dno tno whe ari tsd epa rtu re
meanwhile m
leblanc had seated himself
jon dre tte had taken possession of the other chair facing m
leblanc
now in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow let the reader picture to himself in his own mind aco ldn ight the solitude soft he sal petrie recovered with snow and white as winding sheets in the moonlight the tape rli keli ght soft he street lanterns which shone red lyh ere and the real on gth oset rag icbo ulev ards and the long rows of black elms not a passerby for perhaps a quarter of a league around the go rbe a uh ove lat its highest pitch of silence of horror and of darkness in that building in the midst of those solitude sin them ids to fth at darkness the vast jon dre tte garret light ed by asin gle candle and in that dent women seated at a table m
leblanc tranquil jon dre tte smiling and alarming the jon dre tte woman the female wolf in one corner and behind the partition marius invisible erect not losing a word not missing asin gle movement his eye on the watch and pistol in hand
however marius experience don lya nemo tion of horror but no fear
he clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured
is hall beable to stop that wretch whenever i please he thought
he felt that the police were there somewhere in a mbus cade waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out the ira rm
moreover he was in hopes that this violent encounter between jon dre tte and m
leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was interested in learning
chapter xix occupying one 's self with obscure depth shard ly was m
leblanc seated when he turned his eyes towards the pallets which were empty
how is the poor little wounded girl
he inquired
bad replied jon dre tte with a heartbroken and grateful smile very bad my worthy sir
here lde rsi ster has taken her to the bour be to have her hurt dressed
you will see the mpre sent lyth eyw ill be back immediately
madame faba nto use ems to me to be better went on m
leblanc casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the jon dre tte woman ass he stood between him and the door as though already guarding the exit and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost ofcom bat
she is dying said jon dre tte
but what do you expect sir
she has so much courage that woman has
she 's not a woman she 's an ox
the jon dre tte touched by his compliment deprecated it with the affected air sofa flattered monster
you are always toogood to me monsieur jon dre tte

leblanc it hough tyo urna me was fab an tou

replied the husband hurriedly
an artistic sobriquet
and launching a this wife as hr ugo fthe should ers which m
leblanc did not catch he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice ah
wehave had a happy life together this poor darling and i
what would there be left for us if we had not that

while jon dre tte thus talked with an apparent in coherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious expression of his physiognomy marius raised his eyes and perceived at the other end of the room apers on whom he had not seen before
aman had just enter eds oso ft lyth at the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges
this man wore a violet knitted vest which was old worn spotted cut and gaping at every fold wide trousers of cotton velvet wooden shoes on his feet no shirt had his neck bare his bare arms tattooed and his face smeared with black
he had seated himself in silence on the nearest be dan dash ewa sbe hind jon dre tte he could only be indistinctly seen
that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m
leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius
he could not refrain from ages ture of surprise which did not escape jon dre tte
ah
is ee
exclaimed jon dre tte button in gup his coat with an air of compl aisan ce you are looking at your overcoat
it fits me
my faith but it fits me
whois that man
said m
leblanc
him
ejaculated jon dre tte he'sa neighbor of mine
don't pay any attention to him
the neighbor was a singular looking individual
however manufactories of chemical products abound in the faubourg saint marceau
many of the work men might have blackface s
besides this m
leblanc 's whole person was expressive of candida ndi ntr epid confidence
he went on excuse me what were you saying m
fab an tou
iwas telling you sir and dear protector replied jon dre tte placing his elbows on the table and contemplating m
leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the boac on strict or iwas telling you that ihave apic ture to sell
as light sound came from the door
as econ dman had just enter edan dse at edh ims elf on the bed behind jon dre tte
like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of ink or lamp black
although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been able to prevent m
leblanc catching sight of him
don't mind the msa id jon dre tte the yare people who belong in the house
so i was saying that the re remains in my possession aval uab lep icture
but stops irt a kea look at it
her ose went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned and turned it rounds till leaving it support eda gains tthe wall
it really was something which resembled a picture and which the candle illuminated somewhat
marius could make nothing out of it as jon dre tte stood between the picture and him he only saw a coarse daub and as orto fpr in cipal person age colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings
what is that
asked m
leblanc
jon dre tte exclaimed apa in ting by a master apic ture of great value my benefactor
iam a smu chat tached to it asia mtom yt woda ugh ters it recalls souvenirs to me
but i have to ldy oua ndi will not take it back that i am so wretched that iwill part with it
either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness m
leblanc 's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture
the re were now four men three seated on the bed ones tandi ngn earth edo or postal lfo urw it hbar ear msa nd motionless with faces smeared with black
one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep
he was old his white hair contrasting with his black ened face produced a horrible effect
the other two seemed to be young one wore a beard the other wore his hair long
none of the mha do nsh oest hose who did not wear socks were barefoot ed
jon dre tte notice dth at m
leblanc 's eye was fixed on the semen
the yare friends
the yare neighbors said he
the irfa cesare black because they work in charcoal
the yare chimney builders
don't trouble yourself about the mmy benefactor but buy my picture
have pity on my misery
iwill not ask you much for it
how much do you think it is worth
well said m
leblanc looking jon dre tte full inthe eye and with the manner of a man who is on his guard it is some signboard for a tavern and is worth about three francs
jon dre tter epl ieds we et lyh ave you your pocketbook with you
is hould be satisfied with a thousand crowns
m
leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid glance around the room
he had jon dre tte on his left on the side next the window and the jon dre tte woman and the four men on his right on the side next the door
the four men did not stir and did not even seem to be looking on
jon dre tte had again begun to speak in a plaintive to new it hso vague an eye and so lamentable an intonation that m
leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery
if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactors aid jon dre tte is hall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river

leblanc who was observing him
m
leblanc 's eye was fixed on jon dre tte and jon dre tte 's eye was fixed on the door
marius ' eager attention was transferred from one to the other
m
leblanc seemed to be asking himself is this man an idiot

i went down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose
all at once his dull eyes light edu pwi tha hideous flash the little man drew himself up and became terrible to oka step toward m
leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder that has nothing to do with the question
do you know me
chapter xx the trap the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed aview of three men clad in blueline nbl ouse sand masked with masks of black paper
the first was thin and had along iron tipped cudgel the second who was a sort of colossus carried by the middle of the handle with the blade downward abut cher 's pole axe for slaughter in gcat tle
the third aman with thick sets hould ers not so slender as the first held in his hand an enormous keys to len from the door of some prison
it appeared that the arrival of the semen was what jon dre tte had been waiting for
arap iddi alog uee nsu ed between him and the man with the cudgel the thin one
is everything ready

is it waiting where i ordered

good said jon dre tte
m
leblanc was very pale
he was scrutinizing everything around him in the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into an dhis head directed in turn toward all the head sw hich surrounded him moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there was nothing in his air which resembled fear
he had improvised an int re nch men to uto fthe table and the man who but an instant previously had borne merely the appearance of akin dly oldman had suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture
this oldman who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger seemed to possess one of those nature sw hich areas courageous as the yare kind both easily and simply
the father of a woman who mwe love is never astra nger to us
marius felt proud of that unknown man
three of the men of whom jon dre tte had said the yare chimney builders had a rmed themselves from the pile of old iron on ewi tha heavy pair of shears the second with weighing to ngst he third with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable
the old man had remained on the bed and had merely opened his eyes
the jon dre tte woman had seated herself beside him
marius decided that in a few seconds more them omen tfor intervention would arrive and her aise dhis right hand towards the ceiling in the direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol
jon dre tte having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel turned on cem or et om
leblanc and repeated his question accompanying it with that low repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him so you do not recognize me
m
leblanc looked him full inthe face and replied no
the njo ndr ette advanced to the table
he leaned across the candle crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m
leblanc 's calm face and advancing as far as possible without forcing m
leblanc to retreat and in this post ure of a wild beast who is about to bite he exclaimed myname is not faba nto um yna me is not jon dre tte myname is the nardi er
iam the innkeeper of mont ferme il
do you understand
the nardi er
now do you know me
anal most imperceptible flush crossed m
leblanc 's brow and here plied with a voice which neither trembl edn or rose above its ordinary level with his accustomed placid it yno more than before
marius did not hear this reply
anyone who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard stupid thunderstruck
atthe moment when jon dre tte said myname is the nardi erma riu shad trembl edin every limb and had leaned against the wall as though he felt the cold of a steel blade through his heart
the nhis right arm allready to discharge the signal shot dropped slowly and atthe moment when jon dre tter epe at edt he nardi erd oyo uu nder stand
marius 's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall
jon dre tte by revealing his identity had not moved m
leblanc but he had quite upset marius
that name of the nardi erw it hwh ich m
leblanc did not seem to be acquainted marius knew well
let the reader recall what that name mean tto him
that name he had worn on his heart inscribed in his father 's testament
he bore it at the bottom of his mind in the depths of his memory in that sacred injunction acer taint he nardi ersa ved mylife
if my son encounters him he will do him all the good that lies in his power
that name it will be remembered was one of the pie ties of his soul heming led it with the name of his father in his worship
what
this man was that the nardi erth at innkeeper of mont ferme il who mhe had solo ngan dso vainly sought
he had found him at last and how
his father 's saviour was a ruffian
that man to whose service marius was burning to devote himself was a monster
that liberator of colonel pont mercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope marius did not as yet clearly comprehend but which resembled a nass as sin ation
and against whom great god
what a fatality
what abit term ocker yof fate
his father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in his power to this then a rdi era ndf or four years marius had cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father 's and atthe moment when he was on the eve of having a brigands ei zed in the very act of crime by justice destiny cried to him this is the nardi er
he could atlas tre pay this man for his father 's life saved amidah ails to rmo fgr apes hot on the heroic field of waterloo and repay it with the scaffold
he had sworn to himself that if ever he found that the nardi erh ewo uld address him only by throwing himself at his feet and now he actually had found him but it was only to deliver him over to the execution er
his father said to him succor the nardi er
and here plied to that adored and saint ed voice by crushing the nardi er
he was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had to rn him from death at the peril of his own life executed on the place saint jacques through the means of his son of that marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will
and what am ocker yto have solo ng worn on his breast his father 's last command swri tte ninh is own hand only to act in soho rri bly contrary as ense
but on the other hand now look on that trap and not prevent it
condemn the victim and to spare the assassin
could one beheld to any gratitude to ward sso miserable a wretch
all the idea sw hich marius had cherished for the last four years were pierced through and through a sit were by this unforeseen blow
he shuddered
everything depended on him
unknown to the mse lve she held in his hand all those being sw how ere moving about the rebe for ehi se yes
if he fired his pistol m
leblanc was saved and the nardi erl osti fhe did not fire m
leblanc would be sacrificed and who knows
the nardi erw ould escape
should he dash down the one or allow the other to fall
remorse awaited him in either case
what was he todo
what should hecho ose
be false to the most imperious souvenirs to all those solemn vow sto himself to the most sacred duty to the most venerated text
should he ignore his father 's testament oral low the perpetration of a crime
onthe one hand its eem edt ohim that he heard his urs ules up pli cating for her father and onthe other the colonel commending the nardi ert oh is care
he felt that he was going mad
his knees gave way beneath him
and he had not even the time for deliberation so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe
it was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master and which was now sweeping him away
he was on the verge of swooning
in the meantime the nardi erw homw esha ll henceforth call by no other name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph
he seized the candle in his fist and set it on the chimney piece with so violent aban gth at the wick came near being extinguished and the tallow be spattered the wall
the nhe turned to m
leblanc with a horrible look and spit out the sew or dsd one for

he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment
one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some hole like the rhone the nast hough hewer econ cluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and shouted and with his good ygo ody air

marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was listening
the last possibility of doubt had just vanished
it certainly was the then a rdi ero fthe will
marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point of sofa tally justifying
his perplexity was redoubled
moreover there was in all the sew or dso fthe nardi erin his accent in his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that mixture of braggadocio and abject ness of pride and pettiness of rage and folly in that chaos of real grief sand false sentiments in that immodest yof am alici ous mantas ting the voluptuous delights of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that conflagration of all suffering scom bined with all hatred sso meth in gwh ich was a shi de ousa sev ilan dash ear trending as the truth

when the nardi erh adr ecover ed his breath he turned his blood shot eyes on m
leblanc and said to him in a low curt voice what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you

atthe sametime the then a rdi erw oman had wound her hands in his hair
atthe trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor
the old man on the bed whose emed under the influence of wine descended from the pallet and came reeling up with a stone breaker 's hammer in his hand

don't hurt him
here peated and without suspecting it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting awhile longer
who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing urs ule 's father to perish or of destroying the colonel 's saviour

the nardi erno longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness
marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile of amani no ffi cial life the almost best ial mouth which had been foaming but am omen tbe for ehe gazed with amazement on that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should be hold a tiger converted into a lawyer

all retired towards the door
he went on monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window
you might have broken your leg
now if you will permit me we will converse quietly
in the first place imus tcom municate to you an observation which ihave made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry
the nardi erw as right this detail was correct although it had escaped marius in his agitation
m
leblanc had barely pronounced afew words without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window heh adp reserved them ostp rof ound and singular silence

you might have shouted 's top thief ' abita ndis hould not have thought it improper

it is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons who do n't inspire you with sufficient confidence
you might have done that and noone would have trouble dyo uo nth at account
you would not even have been gagged

ipr ese nt you my compliments and iwill tell you the conclusion that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man shouts who comes
the police
and after the police
justice
well
you have not made an outcry that is because you do n't care to have the police and the court scom ein anymore than we do
it is because i have long suspected it you have some interest in hiding something
on our side wehave the same interest

moreover his language which was stamped with a sort of moderate dsub due din sole ncea ndc raft yin sole nce was reserved and almost choice and in that rascal who had been nothing but a robber as hort time previously one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood
the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention had been called to it trouble dma riu sand affected him with painful astonishment
the nardi er 's well grounded observations till further obscured for marius the dense mystery which envelope dth at grave and singular person on whom cour fey racha dbest owed the sobriquet of monsieur le blanc
but whoever he was bound with ropes surrounded with execution ers half plunged soto speak in agrave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed in the presence of the nardi er 's wrath asin the presence of his sweetness this man remained impassive and marius could not refrain from admiring a tsu cham omen tthe superbly melancholy visage

it was evident that the nardi era voided naming the young girl in question
he said the lark he said the little one but he did not pronounce her name the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices

growled the nardi er

at such a gallop the bourgeois ewi llb ebac kins ide three quarters of an hour
he drew a chair close to the fireplace folding his arms and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier

said he
only five ruffians now remained in the den with the nardi era ndt he prisoner

the yw erec row de dto get her in one corner like brutes and remained silent
the nardi erw armed his feet
the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturn it y
as ombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garret but a few moments before
the candle on which ala rge stranger had formed cast but a dim light in the immense hovel the brazier had grown dull and all those monstrous heads cast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling
no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man who was fast asleep
marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle
the enigma was more impenetrable than ever
who was this little one who mthe nardi erh adc all edt he lark
was she his urs ule
the prisoner had not seem edt obe affected by that word the lark and had replied in the most natural manner in the world id on otk now what you mean
onthe other hand the two letters u
f
were explained the ym ean turba in fabre and urs ule was nolonger name dur sule
this was what marius perceived most clearly of all
as orto fh or rib le fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene
the re he stood almost incapable of movement or reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters
he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide
in any case he said if she is the lark is hall see her for the then a rdi erw omani stob ring her hither
that will be the end and the niw ill give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her
nothing shall stop me
nearly half an hour passed in this manner
the nardi ers eem edt obe absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir
still marius fancied that at intervals and forth elas tfe wmo ments he had heard a faint dull noise in the direction of the prisoner
all at once the nardi era ddress edt he prisoner by the way monsieur fabre imi ght aswell say it to you at once
the sef eww or dsap peared to be the beginning of an explanation
marius strained his ears
my wife will be back shortly don't get impatient
it hink that the lark really is your daughter and its eem sto mequite natural that you should keep her
only listen to me abit
my wife will go and hunt her up with your letter

my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come back here to tell us ' it 's done
' as for the young lady no harm will be done to her the trap will conduct her to aplac ewh eres he will be quiet and just as soon as you have handed over to methos elit tle two hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you
if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark that 's all
the prisoner uttered not as yl lable
after a pause the nardi erco nti nued it 's very simple as you see
the re 'll be no harm done unless you wish that the res hould be harm done
i 'm telling you how things stand
iwar ny ous otha tyo uma ybe prepared
he paused the prisoner did not break the silence and the nardi err esume dass oona sm yw if ere turns and says to me ' the lark is on the way ' we will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home
you see that our intention sare not evil
terrible images passed through marius 'm in d
what
that you ng girl who mthe yw ere abducting was not to be brought back
one of those monsters was to be a rhe roff into the darkness
whither
and what if it were she
it was clear that it was she
marius felt his heart stop beating
what was he todo
discharge the pistol
place all those scoundrels in the hands of justice
but the horrible man with the meat axe would nonetheless be out of reach with the young girl and marius reflected on the nardi er 's words of which he perceived the blood ysi gni fica nce ifyou have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark
now it was not alone by the colonel 's testament it was by his own love it was bythe peril of the one helo ved that he felt himself restrained
this frightful situation which had already last eda bove half an hour was changing its aspect every moment
marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heartbreaking conjecture sse eking hope and finding none
the tumult of his thoughts contrast ed with the funereal silence of the den
in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard too penan dsh uta gain
the prisoner made a movement in his bonds
here 's the bourgeois esa id then a rdi er
he had hardly uttered the words when the then a rdi erw oman did in fact rush hastily into the room red panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she smote her huge hand son her thighs simultaneously false address
the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again
she resumed nobodythere

that old fellow has duped you

marius breathed free lyon cem or e

while his exasperated wife voci fera ted then a rdi erh ads eat ed himself on the table
for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage rever y
finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious to nea false address
what did you expect to gain by that
to gain time
cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and atthe same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut
the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg
before the seven men had time to collect the irs ense sand dash for war dhe had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier and had the nst rai ght ened himself up again and now the nardi erth efe male the nardi era ndt her uffi an shud dled in amazement at the extremity of the hovels tare dat him in stu pef action as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished a bove his head there dho tch is elw hich emitted at hrea ten in ggl ow

it is probable that the prisoner had this soup iec eon his person at the moment when the ruffians search ed him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand and that after ward having his right hand free heun screwed it and used it as a saw to cut the cords which fastened him which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which marius had observed
as he had not been able to be nd down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg
the ruffians had recovered from the irf irst surprise

in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble of defending it
when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to say he stripped up his left sleeve and added see here
atthe same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh
the crackling of the burning flesh became a udi blean dthe odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the hovel

and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window which had been left open the horrible glowing to old is appeared in to the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow

said the nardi er
two of the ruffians laid the ir hands on his shoulder and the masked man with the ventriloquist 's voice to oku phi ssta tion in front of him ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement
atthe sametime marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low to nether eis only one thing left to do
cut his throat
that 's it
it was the husband and wife taking counsel together
the nardi erw al keds low lyt owa rds the table opened the drawer and took out the knife
marius fretted with the handle of his pistol

for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience the one enjoining him to respect his father 's testament the other crying to him to rescue the prisoner
the set wo voices continued uninterrupted lyth at struggle which tormented him to agony
upto that moment he had cherished ava gue hope that he should find some means of reconciling the set wod uti esb ut nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself
however the peril was urgent the last bounds of delay had been reached the nardi erw as standing thoughtfully afew pace sdi stan tfr omt he prisoner

she had thrown off her shawl but retained her bonnet her husband who was crouching behind her was almost hidden under the discarded shawl and she was shielding him with her body as she elevated the paving stone above her head with the gesture of agian tess on the point of hurling a rock

she shouted

in the meanwhile the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door and were shaking him he awoke stammering is it all over jon dre tte

the six pinion ed ruffians were standing and still preserved their spectral mien all three be smeared with black all three masked

at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried shining the re
this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow ofour grasping the principal lines even at the present day
we shall make the attempt
the restoration had been one of those intermediate phase shard to define inwhich the reis fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult and which are not hinge lse than the arrival of agreat nation at a halting place
the see poch sare peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert the mto profit
in the beginning the nation as ksn othing but repose it thirst sfor but one thing peace it has but one ambition to be small
which is the translation of remaining tranquil

but at the same time certain facts arise compel recognition and knock at the door in the irt urn

this then is what appears to philosophical politicians at the same time that we ary men demand repose accomplished fact sde man dg uar an tees
guarantee sare the same to facts that repose is to me n
this is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector this is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire
the seg uar an tees are an ece ssi tyo fthe times
the ym us tbe accorded
prince sgr a ntt he mb uti nre ality it is the force of things which gives the m
apr of ound truth and one useful to know which the stuarts did not suspect in and which the bourbons did not even obtain a glimpse of in
the predestined family which returned to france when napoleon fell had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed and that what it had bestowed it could take back again that the house of bourbon possessed the right divine that france possessed nothing and that the political right conceded in the charter of louis xviii
was merely a branch of the right divine was detached by the house of bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should please the king to re assume it
still the house of bourbon should have felt from the displeasure created by the gift that it did not come from it
this house was churlish to the nineteenth century
it put on an ill tempered look at every development of the nation
to make use of a trivial word that is to say of a popular and at rue word it looked glum
the people saw this
it though tit possessed strength because the empire had been carried away before it like a theatrical stages etting
it did not perceive that it had itself been brought in inthe same fashion
it did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed napoleon
it though tth at it had roots because it was the past
it was mistaken it for me dapa rto fthe past but the whole past was france
the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons but in the nation s
the seo bsc urea nd lively roots constitute dno tthe right of a family but the history of a people
the yw eree very where except under the throne
the house of bourbon was to france the illustrious and bleeding knot in her history but was nolonger the principal element of her destiny and the necessary base of her politics
she could get along with out the bourbons she had done without the mfor two and twenty years there had been a break of continuity the ydi dno tsu spec tthe fact
and how should they have suspected it the yw hof an cie dth at louis xvi i
reigned on the tho fthe rmi doran dth at louis xviii
was reigning at the battle of marengo
never since the origin of history had prince sbe enso blind in the presence of facts and the portion of divine authority which facts contain and promulgate
never had that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high

when the hours eem edt oit to have come there stora tions up posing itself victorious over bonaparte and well rooted in the country that is to say believing it self to be strong and deep abruptly decided on its plan of action and risk edit sst roke
one morning it drew itself up before the face of france and elevating its voice it contested the collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty of the citizen to liberty
in other words it denied to the nation that which made it an ation and to the citizen that which made him a citizen
this is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the ordinance so fj uly
the restoration fell
it fell just ly
but we admit it had not been absolutely hostile to all forms of progress
great things had been accomplished with it alongside
under the restoration the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion which had been lacking under the republican dto grandeur in peace which had been wanting under the empire
france free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other people so feu rope
the revolution had had the word under robespierre the cannon had had the word under bonaparte it was under louis xviii
and charles x
that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word
the wind ceased the torch was lighted on cem or e
onthe lofty heights the pure light of mind could be seen flickering

for aspace of fifteen years those great principles which are so old fort he thinkers on ewf or the state sma nco uld be seen at work in perfect peace on the public square equality before the law liberty of conscience liberty of speech liberty of the press the accessibility of all aptitude stoa ll functions
thus it proceeded until
the bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the hands of providence
the fall of the bourbons was full of grandeur not on the irs ide but on the side of the nation
the yq uit te dthe throne with gravity but without authority their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearance sw hich leave a sombre emotion in history itwas neither the spectral calm of charles i

charles x
during the voyage from cherbourg causing around table to be cutover into a square table appeared to be more anxious about imperil led etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy
this diminution saddened devoted men who loved the irp erson sands eri ous men who honored their race
the populace was admirable
the nation attacked on emo rning with weapons by a sort of royal insurrection felt it self inthe possession of so much for cet hat it did not goin to a rage
it defended its elf restrained itself restored things to the irp laces the government to law the bourbons to exile alas
and the nha lte d
it took the old king charles x
from beneath that dais which had sheltered louis xiv
and set him gently on the ground
it touched the royal person ages only with sadness and precaution
it was not one man itwas not a few men itwas france france entire france victorious and intoxicated with her victory whose emed to becoming to herself and who put into practice before the eyes of the whole world these grave words of guillaume du vaira fter the day of the barricades it is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favor soft hegre at and to spring like a bird from bought obo ugh from an afflicted fortune to a flourishing one to show themselves harsh towards the irp rince in his adversity but as for me the fortune of my kings and especially of my afflicted kings will always be venerable to me
the bourbons carried away with the mres pect but not regret
as we have just stated their misfortune was greater than the yw ere
the yf ade do uti nthe horizon
the revolution of july instantly had friends and enemies throughout the entire world
the first rushed to ward her with joy and enthusiasm the other stu rne dawa yea cha cco rding to his nature
atthe first blush the prince so feu rope the owls of this dawn shut the ire yes wounded and stupefied and only opened the mto threaten
afri ght which can be comprehended awra th which can be pardoned
this strange revolution had hardly produced as hock it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy and of shedding its blood
in the eyes of despotic government sw hoare always interested in having liberty calum nia tei tse lft here volution of july committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle
nothing however was attempted or plotted against it
the most discontented the most irritated the most trembling salute dit whatever our egotism and our rancor maybe a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration of someone who is working above man
the revolution of july isthe triumph of right overthrowing the fact
at hing which is full of splendor
right overthrowing the fact
hence the brilliancy of the revolution of hence also its mildness
right triumphant has no need of being violent
right is the just and the true
the property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure
the fact even when most necessary to all appearances even when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries if it exist only as a fact and if it contain only to olit tle of right or none at all is infallibly destined to become inthe course of time deformed impure perhaps even monstrous
if one desires to learn atone blow to what degree of hideous ness the fact can attain viewed at the distance of centuries let him look at machiavelli
machiavelli is not an evil genius norad emo nnor amis erable and cowardly writer he is not hing but the fact
and he is not only the italian fact he is the european fact the fact of the sixteenth century
he seems hideous and so he is in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth
this conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin of society
to terminate this duel to amalgamate the pure idea with the human ere ality to cause right to penetrate pacific all yin to the fact and the fact into right that is the task of sages
chapter ii badly sewed but the task of sages is one thing the task of clever men is another
the revolution of came to as ud den halt
as soon as a revolution has made the coast the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck
the skilful in our century have conferred on the mse lve sthe title of state sme nso that this words tates men has ended by becoming somewhat of aslan gwo rd
it must be borne in mind in fact that wherever there is not hing but skill there is necessarily pettiness
to say the skilful amounts to saying the mediocre
in the same way to say states men is sometimes equivalent to saying traitors
if the nwea re tobe lieve the skilful revolution slike the revolution of july are severe darter ies apr omp tli gat urei sind is pens able
the right to ogr and ly proclaimed is shaken
also right on cef irm lyf i xed the state must be strengthened
liberty once assured attention must be directed to power
here the sages are not as yet separate dfr omt he skilful but the ybe ginto be distrustful
power very good
but in the first place what is power
in the second when cecom esi t
the skilful donots eem to hear the murmured objection and the yc on tinue the irma no euv res
according to the politicians who are ingenious inputting the mask of necessity on profitable fiction sthe first requirement of a people after a revolution when this people for ms part of amon arch ical continent is to procure for itself a dynasty
in this way say they peace that is to say time to dress our wounds and to repair the house can be had after a revolution
the dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance
now it is not always easy to procure a dynasty
if it is absolutely necessary the first man of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of aking
you have in the first case napoleon in the second it urb ide
but the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty
the reis necessarily require dace rtai nm odic umo fan ti quit yin arac eand the wrinkle of the centuries can not be improvised
if we place ourselves at the point of view of the state sme naf term aking all allowances ofcourse after a revolution what are the qualities of the king which result from it
he may be an dit is useful for him to be a revolutionary that is to say apart icip anti nhis own person in that revolution that he should have lent a hand to it that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself there in that he should have to uche dthe axe or wielded the sword in it
what are the qualities of a dynasty
it should be national that is to say revolutionary at a distance not through acts committed but by reason of ideas accepted
it should be composed of past and be historic be composed of future and be sympathetic
all this explains why the early revolution sco nte nte dthe msel ves with finding a man cromwell or napoleon and why the second absolutely insist edon finding a family the house of brunswick or the house of orleans
royal house sres embl ethos ein dian figtree seach branch of which bending over to the earth takes root and becomes a figtree itself

is a revolution arrested midway
half of progress quasi right

who arrests revolution shal fwa y
the bourgeoisie
why
because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction
yesterday it was appetite today it is plenitude tomorrow it will be satiety
the phenomenon of after napoleon was reproduced in after charles x
the attempt has been made and wrongly to make a class of the bourgeoisie
the bourgeoisie is simply the content edp or tion of the people
the bourgeois is the man who now has time to sit down
acha iris not a cast e
but through a desire to sit down to oso on one may arrest the very march of the human race
this has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie
one is not aclass because one has committed a fault
selfishness is not one of the division soft he social order
moreover we must be just to selfishness
the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspire daft erth esh ock of was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness and which contains a little shame it was not the slumber which presupposes a moment ary forgetfulness accessible to dream sit was the halt
the halt is a word for me do fas in gular double and almost contradictory sense at roop on the march that is to say movement as tan dth at ist osa yr epos e
the halt is the restoration of forces it is repose armed and onthe alert it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinel sand holds itself on its guard
the halt presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of tomorrow
it is the partition between and
what we here call combat may also be designated as progress

louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be ranked among the most illustrious governor so fhist or yha dhe love dgl or yb uta little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful
louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age here maine dgr ace fu lno tal ways approved by the nation heal ways was so by the masses he pleased
he had that gift of charming
he lacked majesty he wore no crown although aking and now hit eha ira lthough an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the new am i xt ure of the noble and the bourgeois which suited louis philippe was transition reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote les polo no isan dhe pronounced les hong rais
he wore the uniform of the national guard like charles x
and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon
he went alittle to chapel not at all tothe chase never to the opera
incorruptible by sacri stan sby whippers in by ballet dancer sth is made apart of his bourgeois popularity
he had no heart
he went out with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long form eda part of his aureole
he was a bit of a mason abit of agar den er something of a doctor he bled apos til i on who had tumbled from his horse louis philippe no more went about without his lance tth and i dhe nri iv

the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the first who had ever she dbl ood with the object of healing
for the grievance saga in stlouis philippe the reis one deduction to be made the reis that which accuses royalty that which accuses the reign that which accuses the king three columns which all give different total s
democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of secondary interest the protests of the street violently repressed military execution of insurrection sthe rising passed over by arms the rue trans non ain the counsel so fwa rthe absorption of the real country by the legal country on half share swith three hundred thousand privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused algeria to oha rsh lyco nq uer edan das in the case of india by the english with more barbarism than civilization the breach of faith to abdelkader blay ed eu tz bought pritchard paid the sea re the doings of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing ofthe king
as will be seen the proper deduction having been made the king 's charge is decreased
this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france
when cear is est his fault
wewill state it
louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be disturbed hence excessive timidity which is displeasing to the people who have the tho fj uly in the irc ivil and austerlitz in the irm ilita ryt radi tion
moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his family was deserved by the family
that domestic group was worth yof admiration
virtues the red we lts ide by side with talent s
one of louis philippe 's daughter smar ie d'or leans place dthe name of her race among artists as charles d' orleans had placed it among poets
she made of her soul amar blew hich she named jeanne d' arc

this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is the truth about louis philippe
to be prince equality to be a rin his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power there in la ythe fortune of louis philippe in never was the ream or ecom plete adaptation of amant oan event the one entered into the other and the incarnation to ok place
louis philippe is made man
moreover he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile
he had been proscribed awan der er poor
he had lived by his own labor
in switzerland this heir to the richest prince lyd oma in sin france had sold an old horse inorder to obtain bread
at reichen a uhe gave lessons in mathematics while his sister adelaide did wool work and sewed
the ses ou venir sco nne cted with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic
he had with his own hands demolished the iron cage of mont saint michel built by louis xian dus ed by louis xv
he was the companion of dum our ie zhe was the friend of lafayette he had belonged to the jacobins ' club mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder danton had said to him young man

sowell name dth at poor tyrant
the blind clairvoyance of the revolution breaking royalty in the king and the king with royalty did so almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea the vast storm of the assembly tribunal the public wrath interrogating cape tno tkn owing what to reply the alarming stupefied vacillation by that royal head beneath that sombre breath there lative innocence of all in that catastrophe of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned he had looked on those things he had contemplated that giddiness he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the assembly convention he had beheld behind louis xvi
that unfortunate passerby who was made responsible the terrible culprit the monarchy rise through the shadows and the reha dling ered in his soul there spec tfu lfe a rof the sei mme nse justice soft he populace which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god
the trace left in him by the revolution was prodigious
it sme mory was like a living imprint of those great year smi nut eby minute
one day in the presence of a witness who mwe are not permitted to doubt here cti fied from memory the whole of the letter ain the alphabetical list of the constituent assembly
louis philippe was a king of the broad daylight
while here ign edt he press was free the tribune was free conscience and speech were free
the laws of september are open to sight
although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges he left his throne exposed to the light
history will do justice to him for this loyalty
louis philippe like all historical men who have passed from the scene is today put on his trial by the human conscience
his case is a sye to nly in the lower court
the hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent has not yet sounded for him the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king the austere and illustrious historian louis blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict louis philippe was elected by those two almost sw hich are called the and that is to say by a half parliament and a half revolution and in any case from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself we can not judge him here as the reader has seen above except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle in the eyes of the absolute outside the set wor ights the right of man in the first place the right of the people in the second all is usurpation but what we can say even at the present day that after making the seres erv esis that to sum up the whole and in whatever manner he is considered louis philippe taken in himself and from the point of view of human goodness will remain to use the antique language of ancient history on eof the best prince sw hoe versa to nath ron e

and the man is good
he is good at times event othe point of being admirable
often in the midst of his grave sts ou venir saft era day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent here turned at night to his apartment sand there exhausted with fatigue overwhelmed with sleep what did he do
he took a death sentence and passed the night in revising a criminal suit considering its ome thing to hold his own against europe but that it was a still greater matter to rescue aman from the execution er

sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table he examined the mall it was anguish to him to abandon the semi sera ble condemned heads
one day he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred iwon seven last night
during the early years of his reign the death penalty was a sgo oda sabol is he dan dthe erection of a scaffold was a violence committed against the king

louis philippe was a sge ntl eas louis ix

now to our mind in history where kindness is the rarest of pearl st heman who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great
louis philippe having been severely judge dby some harsh ly perhaps by others it is quite natural that aman himself a phantom at the present day who knew that king should come and testify in his favor before history this deposition whatever else it may be is evident lya nda bove all things entirely disinterested an epitaph penned by a deadman is sincere one shade may console another shade the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise it itis not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two to mbs in exile this one flattered the other
chapter iv cracks beneath the foundation at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of louis philippe 's reign it was necessary that the res hould be no equiv oq uea ndi tbe came requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king
louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence without any direct action on his part by virtue of a revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the revolution but in which he the duc d' orleans exercise dno personal initiative
he had been born apr in cea nd hebel ie ved himself to have been elected king
he had not served this mandate on himself he had not take niti thad been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the offer was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty
hence his possession was in good faith
now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharge dby the social conflicts weighs neither on the king nor on the democracy
acl as hof principles resembles a clash of elements
the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people there lative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is the republic society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes its suffering today will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed on eof the two parties is evident lym is taken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two shores at once with one foot on the republican done in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more acri min altha nave nde an isa ruffian

first problem to produce wealth
second problem to share it
the first problem contains the question of work
the second contains the question of salary
in the first problem the employment of forces is inquest ion
in the second the distribution of enjoyment

it is a partition made by the butcher which kills that which it divides
it is therefore impossible to pause over the sep rete nde dso lutions
slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it
the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved
the two problems must be combined and made but one
solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will be england
you will have like venice an artificial power or like england amater ial power you will be the wicked richman
you will die by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england will fall

such was the situation
the faubourg saint antoine more than any other group of the population as we stated in the beginning accentuated this situation and made it felt
that was the sore point
this old faubourg people dli kean anthill laborious courageous and angry as a hive of bees was quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult
everything was in a state of agitation the re without any interruption however ofthe regular work
it is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy
in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs the real soe xis tra re and ardent minds
it is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is dangerous to have extreme smee t
the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble for it received the counter shock of commercial crises of failure sst rike ssl acks eason salli nh erent to great political disturbances
intimes of revolution misery is both cause and effect
the blow which it deals rebounds upon it
this population full of proud virtue capable to the highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark
whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chase dby the wind of events itis impossible not to think of the faubourg saint antoine and ofthe formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of paris that powder house of suffering and ideas
the wines hops of the faubourg antoine which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess historical notoriety

this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any other but even when led astray it remains great
we may say of it as of the blind cyclops in gens

epon in ech apter it hela rk 's meadow marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track heh ads et javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building bearing of fhi spri son ers in three hackney coaches than marius also glided out of the house
it was only nine o'clock in the evening
marius betook himself to cour fey rac
cour fey rac was nolonger the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la verre rie for political reasons this quarter was one where a tth at epoch insurrection like dto install itself
marius said to cour fey raci have come to sleep with you
cour fey rac dragged am at tress of fhi sbe dwh ich was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said the re
at seven o'clock on the following morning marius returned to the hovel paid the quarter 's rent which he owed to ma'am bou go nha dhis books his bed his table his commode and his two chairs loaded on a hand cart and went off without leaving his address so that when javert returned in the course of the morning for the purpose of questioning marius as to the event soft he preceding evening he found only ma'am bou go nw hoan swer edmo veda way
ma'am bou go nwa sco nvi nce dth at marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before
who would ever have said it
she exclaimed to the port resses of the quarter ayo ung man like that who had the air of a girl
marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence
the first was that he now had a horror of that house where he had beheld so close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious development asocial deformity which is perhaps even more terrible than the wicked richman the wicked poorman
the second was that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would in sue in all probability and be brought into testify against the nardi er
javert thought that the young man who sena me he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home atthe time of the ambush he made some effort sto find him however but without success
amon th passed the nano the r
marius was still with cour fey rac
he had learned from a young licentiate in law anh abit ual frequent ero fthe court st hat the nardi erw asin close confinement
every monday marius had five francs handed in to the clerk 's office of la force for the nardi er
as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five francs from cour fey rac
it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money
the seper iod ical five francs were a double riddle to cour fey rac whole nta ndt othe nardi erw hore ceived the m
to whom can they go
though tco ur fey rac
when ceca nthis come to me
the nardi eras ked himself
moreover marius was heartbroken
everything had plunged through a trapdoor once more
he nolonger saw anything before him his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumbling ly
he had for a moment beheld very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl who mhe love dthe oldman whose emed to be her father those unknown being sw how ere his only interest and his only hope in this world and atthe very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping the magus thad swept all the ses had ows away
not as park of certain tyan dtr uth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions
no conjecture was possible
he nolonger knew event he name that he thought he knew
it certainly was not urs ule
and the lark was an ic kna me
and what was he toth in kof the old man
was he actually in hiding from the police
the white haired work man who mma riu shade ncount ered in the vicinity of the invalid esr ecu rre dto his mind
it now seemed probable that that working man and m
leblanc were one and the same person
so he disguised himself
that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides
why had he not called for help
why had he fled
was he or was he not the father of the young girl
was heins hort the man who mthe nardi erth ought that he recognized
the nardi erm ight have been mistaken
the sef or meds oman yin soluble problems
all this itis true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg
heartrending distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes
he was thrust on war dhew as drawn and he could not stir
all had vanished save love
of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illumination s
ordinarily this flame which burns us lights usa lso alittle and cast sso meuse ful gleams without
but marius nolonger even heard the sem ute counsel so fpa ssion
he never said to himself what if i were to go to such a place
what if i were to try such an dsu chat hing
the girl who mhec ould nolonger call urs ule was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her
his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty with in an impenetrable fog
to see her once again he still aspire dto this but he nolonger expected it
to crown all his poverty had returned
he felt that i cyb re ath close to him on his heels
in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes
ahab it which is easy to get rid of an ddi ffi cult to take up again
acer taina mount of dreaming is good like an arc otic indiscreet doses
it lulls to sleep the fever soft hemin dat labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirit as of tand fresh vapor which corrects the over harsh contours of pure thought fill sing a pshe re andthe rebind sto get her and round sofft he angles of the idea s

error
though tis the toil of the intelligence rever yit svo lup tuo us ness
to replace thought with rever yi stoc on found a poison with a food
marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember
passion had super vene dan dha dfi nished the work of precipitating him into chimaera swith out object or bottom
one nolonger emerges from one 's self except for the purpose of going off to dream
idle production
tumultuous and stagnant gulf
and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase
this is a law
man in a state of rever yi sge nera lly prodigal and slack the unstrung mind can not hold life with inclose bounds
the reis in that mode of life good mingled with evil for if ener vation is baleful generosity is good and health ful
but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost
resources are exhausted needs crop up
fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest aswell as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holds suicide or crime

marius was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl who mhe nolonger saw
what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true
the memory of an absent being kind les in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and despairing souls eest his light on its horizon the star of the inner night
she that was marius ' whole thought
he meditated of nothing else he was confused lyco nsci oust hath is old coat was becoming a nimpo ssi ble coat and that his new coat was growing old that his shirt swer ewe arin gout that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself if i could but see her once again before i die
one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that he rgl an ceh adt old him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still love dhi mpe rha ps
who knows whether she were not think i ngo fhi mash ewa sth in king of her
sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as a re experience dby every heart that loves though he had no reason sfor anything but sadness and yet felt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself itis her thoughts that are coming to me
the nhe added perhaps my thoughts reach her also
this illusion at which he shook his head am omen tla ter was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul
from time to time especially at that evening hour which is the most depressing to event he dream yhe allowed the purest the most impersonal the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain to fall upon an ote book which contained nothing else
he called this writing to her
it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged
quite the contrary
he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more clear sightedness and rectitude than ever
marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes event hemos tin different deeds and men he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest dejection and candid disinterestedness
his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope he ldi tse lfa loo fan dso are don high
in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny
happy even in the midst of anguish is het ow hom god has given as oul worthy of love and of unhappiness
he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true
the soul which loves and suffers is in a state of sublimity
however day followed day and nothing new presented itself
it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant
he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottom less abyss

that day there was a rarity on the boulevard apas serb y
marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this passerby what is the name of this spot

chapter ii embryonic formation of crimes in the incubation of prisons javert 's triumph in the go rbe a uh ove lse emed complete but had not been so
in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety javert had not take nthe prisoner prisoner
the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this person age who had been so precious acap ture for the ruffians would be no less fine apr ize for the authorities
and the nmo ntp arna sse had escaped javert
another opportunity of laying hands on that devil 's dandy must be waited for
montparnasse had infact encountered epon in eas she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and had led her off preferring to play nemo rin with the daughter rather than sch in der hannes with the father

he had converted himself into vapor he had slipped through the handcuffs he had trickled through the crevices of the carriage the fia crew as cracked and he had fled all that the yw ere able to say was that on arriving at the prison there was no cla queso us
either the fairies or the police had had a hand in it
had cla queso us melted into the shadows like a snowflake in water
had the rebe en una vowed connivance of the police agents
did this man belong to the double enigma of order and disorder
was he concentric with infraction and repression
had this sphinx his fore paws in crime and his hind paws in authority
javert did not accept such comminatio nsa nd would have bristled up against such compromise sbu this squad included other inspectors besides himself who were more initiated than he perhaps although the yw ere his subordinates in the secrets of the prefecture and cla queso us had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent
it is an excellent thing for ruffian is mandan admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night
the sedo ubl eed ged rascals do exist
however that maybe cla queso us had gone astray and was not found again
javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this
as for marius that boob yof ala wyer who had probably become frightened and whose name javert had forgotten javert attached very little importance to him
moreover ala wyer can be hunted up at anytime
but was heal a wyer after all
the investigation had begun
the magistrate had thought it advisable not to put on eof the semen of the band of patron minette in close confinement in the hope that he would chatter

it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him thinking him more useful in the charlemagne yard than in close confinement

or hepa ssed his time in trembling chattering his teeth saying that he had a fever and inquiring whether one of the eight and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant

the nhe turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars
the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the trouble so fma nbe neath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy

he lived in the lark 's meadow more than in cour fey rac 's lodgings
that was his real address boulevard de la sante at the seventh tree from the rue cro uleb arb e
that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins
ache erful sunlight penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves
he was dreaming of her
and his meditation turning to are proach fell back upon himself here flected doleful lyon his idleness his paralysis of soul which was gaining on him and of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him to such a point that he nolonger even saw the sun
nevertheless athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue so feeble had action become in him and he had no longer the force to care to despair at hwa rtt his melancholy absorption sensations from without did reach him

she had accomplished a double progress towards the light and towards distress
she was barefoot edan din rags as onthe day when she had sores olu tel yen tered his chamber only her rags were two months old erno wthe holes were larger the tatters more sordid
it was the same harsh voice the same brow dimmed and wrinkled with tan the same free wild and vacillating glance
she had besides more than formerly in her face that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison add stow retch edn ess
she had bits of straw and hay in her hair not like ophelia through having gone mad from the contagion of hamlet 's madness but because she had slept in the loft of some stable
and inspite of it all she was beautiful

she stood for several moments as though incapable of speech

the house in the rue plume tch apter it heh ouse with a secret about the middle of the last century ach ie fj ustice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for a tth at period the grand sei gno rsd is played the irm is tresses and the bourgeois concealed the mha dalit tle house built in the faubourg saint germain in the desert ed rue blome twh ichi snow called rue plume tno tfa rfr omt he spot which was the ndes ignated as combat des animaux
this house was composed of asin gles to ried pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor aki tche nd own stairs aboud oir upstairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street
this garden was about an acre and a half in extent
this was all that could be seen by passersby but behind the pavilion there was an arrow courtyard and atthe end of the courtyard alow building consisting of two rooms and ace lla rasor to fpr epa ratio ndes tine dto conceal a child and nurse in case of need
this building communicate dint here arby am asked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two lofty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylon e
through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself everyday in a mysterious ways ome where and would never have suspected that togo to the rue de babylon ewa sto goto the rue blome t
thanks to clever purchase rso flan dthe magistrate had been able to make a secret sewer like passage on his own property and consequently without interference
later on heh ads old in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietor soft he selo tso nbo ths ides thought they had a party wall before the ire yes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid the irf lower beds and the iro rch ards
only the birds beheld this curiosity
it is probable that the linnet sand to mti tso fthe last century gossip eda great deal about the chief justice
the pavilion built of stone in the taste of mansard wainscot edan dfu rni she dint he watteau style roca ill eon the inside old fashioned on the outside wall edin with a triple hedge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love and magistracy
this house and corridor which have no wdi sapp eared were in existence fifteen years ago
in ' acop per smith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price then ation made him bankrupt
so that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith
after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life
it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always forsale or to let and the tenor ado zen people who passed through the rue plume twere warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden walls in ce
towards the end of the restoration the sesame passersby might have noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutter son the first floor were open
the house was occupied in fact
the windows had short curtains as i gnt hat there was a woman about
in the month of october amano face rtai nage had presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood including ofcourse the back building and the lane which ended in the rue de babylon e
he had had the secret opening soft he two doors to this passage repaired
the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished with the justice 's old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs had added what was lacking here and the reha dre place dthe paving stones in the yard bricks in the floor sst eps in the stairs missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows and had finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly maidservant without commotion rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house
the neighbors did not gossip about him for the reason that the re were none igh bors
this unobtrusive tenant was jean valjean the young girl was cosette
the servant was a woman named to us saint who mje an valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness and who was elderly as tamm ere rand from the province sth re equalities which had decided jean valjean to take her with him
he had hired the house under the name of m
fau che le vent independent gentleman
in all that has been related heretofore the reader has doubtless be enno less prompt than the nardi ert or eco gni ze jean valjean
why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit pic pus
what had happened
nothing had happened
it will be remembered that jean valjean was happy in the convent so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm
he saw cosette everyday he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more he brooded over the soul of that child he said to himself that she was his that nothing could take her from him that this would last indefinitely that she would certainly become an un being the reto gently in cited everyday that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him that he should grow old there and that she would grow up the retha tsh ewo uld grow old there and that he should diet here that in short delightful hope nose para ti on was possible
on reflecting upon this he fell into perplexity
he interrogated himself
he asked himself if all that happiness were really his ifi twere not composed of the happiness of another of the happiness of that child which he ano ldm an wasco nfi scat in gand stealing if that were not the ft
he said to himself that this child had a right to know life before renouncing it that to deprive her in advance and in some sort without consulting her of all joys under the pretext of saving her from all trials to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her was to rob a human creature of its nature and to lie to go d
and who knows if when she came to be aware of all this someday and found herself an unto her sorrow cosette would not come to hate him
alas tal most selfish thought and less heroic than the rest but which was intolerable to him
here solved to quit the convent
here solved on this here cogni zed with anguish the fact that it was necessary
as for objections the re were none
five years 's ojo urn between the sef our walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the elements of fear
he could return tranquil lya mon gme n
he had grown old and all had undergone a change
who would recognize him now
and the nto face the worst there was danger only for himself and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys
besides what is danger in comparison with the right
finally nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions
as for cosette 's education itwas almost finished and complete
his determination on cet aken he awaited an opportunity
it was not long in presenting itself
old fau che le vent died
jean valjean demanded an audience with the revered prior essa ndt old hertha tha ving come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother which permitted him henceforth to live without working he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him but that as it was not just that cosette since she had not take nthe vows should have received her education gratuitously he humbly begged the reverend prior ess to see fit that he should offer to the community as indemnity for the five years which cosette had spent the re the sum of five thousand francs
it was thus that jean valjean quitted the convent of the perpetual adoration
on leaving the convent he took in his own arms the little valise the key to which he still wore on his person and would permit no porter to touch it
this puzzle dc oset tebe cause of the odor of embalming which proceeded from it
let us state at once that this trunk never quit ted him more
he always had it in his chamber
it was the first and only thing sometimes that he carried off in his moving when he moved about
cosette laughed at it and called this valise his inseparable saying i am jealous of it
nevertheless jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety
he discovered the house in the rue plume tan dhi dhi msel ffr omsi ght the re
henceforth he was in the possession of the name ultime fau che le vent
atthe sametime hehir edt woot her apartment sin paris in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter and so that he could at need take himself off at the slightest disquiet ude which should assail him and in short so that he might not again be caught un provided as onthe night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert
the set woa partments were very pitiable poor in appearance and in two quarters which were far remote from eachother the one in the rue de l' ouest the other inthe rue de l' homme arm e
he went from time to time now to the rue de l' homme armen owt other ued el ' ouest to pass a month or six weeks without taking toussaint
he had himself served by the porters and gave himself out as agent leman from the suburbs living on his funds and having a little temporary resting place in town
this lofty virtue had three domicile sin paris for the sake of escaping from the police
chapter ii jean valjean as an ational guard however properly speaking heli vedi nthe rue plume tan dhe had arranged his existence there in the following fashion cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big sleeping room with the painted pier glasses the boudoir with the gilded fillets the justice 's drawing room furnished with tapestries and vast armchairs she had the garden

long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the bed hung at the windows ofthe first floor
onthe ground floor the curtains were of tapestry
all winter long cosette 's little house was heated from top to bottom
jean valjean inhabited the sort of porter 's lodge which was situated at the end of the backcourt yard with a mattress on a folding bed awh it ewood table two straw chairs an earthenware water jug afew old volume son as he lfh is beloved valise in one corner and never any fire
he dined with cosette and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use
when toussaint came he had said to her itis the young lady who is the mistress of this house
and you monsieur
toussaint replied in amazement
iam a much better thing than the master iam the father
cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated their expenditure which was very modest
everyday jean valjean put his arm through cosette 's and took her for a walk
he led her to the luxembourg tothe least frequent ed walk and every sunday he took her to mass at saint jacques duh aut pas because that was along way of f
as it was avery poor quarter he bestowed a lms largely the rea ndt he poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him the nardi er 's epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques duh aut pas
he was fond of taking cosette to visit the poor and the sick

toussaint brought the irp rov is ions and jean valjean went himself for water to a fountain nearby onthe boulevard

the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit pic pusa sort of impenetrable and holy cloud when ce jean valjean had emerged in venerable guise and consequently worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the townhall
three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard he did this will ingly however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with everyone and yet left him solitary
jean valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape his sergeant major nor to quibble with comte de lo bau he possessed no civil status he was concealing his name he was concealing his identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we have just said he will ingly did his duty as an ational guard the sum of his ambition layin resembling a nyo the rma nw hop aid his taxes
this man had for his ideal within the angel with out the bourgeois
let us note on ede tail however when jean valjean went out with cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of areti red officer
when he went out alone which was generally at night he was always dressed in a working man 's trousers and blouse and wore a cap which concealed his face
was this precaution or humility
both
cosette was accustomed to the enigmatic als ideo fhe rd est in yand hardly noticed her father 's peculiarities
as for toussaint she venerated jean valjean and thought everything he did right
one day herb utc her who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to her that 's a queer fish
she replied he 's asain t
neither jean valjean norco set tenor toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the rue de babylon e
unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that the yli vedi nthe rue plume t
that gate was always closed
jean valjean had left the garden uncultivated inorder not to attract attention
in this possibly he made a mistake

all the nuns in the world are not worth a smu chas one mother in the formation of a young girl 's soul
cosette had had no mother
she had only had many mothers in the plural

cosette had but acon fused recollection of her childhood
she prayed morning and evening for her mother who ms he had never know n
the then a rdi ers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream
she remembered that she had gone on eda yat night to fetch water in a forest
she thought that it had been very far from paris
it seemed to her that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean who had rescued her from it
her childhood produced upon her the effect of atime when the reha dbe enno thing around her but mill epe dssp iders and serpents
when she meditated in the evening before falling asleep as she had not avery clear idea that she was jean valjean 's daughter and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that goodman and had come to dwell near her
when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and dropped as i lent tears ayin gto herself perhaps this man is my mother
cosette although this is a strange statement to make inthe profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity had ended by fancying that she had had a slit tle mother as possible
she did not even know her mother 's name
whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent
if she repeated her question here sponded with a smile
once she insisted the smile ended in a tear
this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fantin ewi thd ark ness

solon gas cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother when she became a young girl itwas impossible for him to do so
it seemed to him that he nolonger dared
was it because of cosette
was it because of fantin e
he felt acer tain religious horror at letting that shadow enter cosette 's thought and of placing a third in the ird est in y
the more sacred this shade was to him the more did it seem that it was to be feared
he thought of fantin eand felt himself overwhelmed with silence
through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have its finger on its lips
had all the modest yw hich had been infant in eand which had violently quitted her during her lifetime returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her grave
was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure
we who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation
hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of fantin e
one day cosette said to him father is a wm ym other in a dream last night
she had two big wings
my mother must have been almost as a intd uring her life
through martyrdom replied jean valjean
however jean valjean was happy
when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy in the plenitude of her heart
jean valjean felt his heart melt with in him with delight at all the ses parks of a tenderness so exclusive so wholly satisfied with himself alone
the poor man trembl edin undated with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all the irl ives he told him self that he really had not suffered sufficiently to merits or a dian tab lissa nd he thanked god in the depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved thus he awr etc hb yth at innocent being

she had not slept well that was all here yes were sunken and she was pale
she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer
she did not look at herself again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror
in the evening after dinner she generally embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing room and jean valjean read beside her
once she raised here yes from her work and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which he rfa the rwa sga zing at her
on another occasion she was passing along the street and its eem edt oh erth at someone behind her whom she did not see said apr etty woman
but badly dressed
bah
she thought he does not mean me
iam well dressed and ugly
she was the nwea ring aplus hha tan dhe rme rino gown
atlas tone day when she was in the garden she heard poor old toussaint saying do you notice how pretty cosette is growing sir
cosette did not hear her father 's reply butt ous saint 's words caused a sort of commotion within her
she fled from the garden ran up to her room flew to the looking glass it was three months since she had looked at herself and gave vent to a cry
she had just dazzled herself
she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint and her mirror
her figure was formed her skin had grown white her hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendor had been lighted in her blue eyes
the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint had said so it was evidently she of whom the passerby had spoken there could nolonger bean yd ou bto ft hats he descended to the garden again thinking herself a queen imagining that she heard the birds singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible delight
jean valjean on his side experience dade epa nd undefinable oppression at heart
infact he had for sometime past been contemplating with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant everyday on cosette 's sweet face
the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy for him
cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably longtime before she became aware of it herself
but from the very first day that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl 's person wounded jean valjean 's sombre eye
he felt that it was a change in a happy life alife so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of disa rra ngi ngso meth in g
this man who had passed through all manner of distress es who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who had been almost wicked and who had become almost as a int who after having dragged the chain of the galleys was now dragging the invisible but he avy chain of indefinite misery this man who mthe law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature of the world one thing that cosette might love him
that cosette might continue to love him
that god would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him
beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded with benefits recompense dcr owned
beloved by cosette it was well with him
he asked nothing more
had anyone said to him do you want anything better
he would have answered no
god might have said to him do you desire heaven
and he would have replied is hould lose by it
everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface made him shudder like the beginning of something new
he had never know nve ry distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively that it was something terrible
he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out evermore triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent and formidable brow of that child from the depths of her home lines so fhi sold age of his misery of his reprobation
he said to himself how beautiful she is
what is to become of me
the remo re overlay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of a mother
what he beheld with anguish am other would have gazed upon with joy
the first symptoms were not long in making the ira ppe aran ce
onthe very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself decided ly iam beautiful
cosette began to pay attention to her toilet
she recalled the remark of that passerby pretty but badly dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished after deposit in gin her heart one of the two germs which are destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquet ry
love is the other
with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded with in her
she conceived a horror for her merino sands ham efor her plus hha t
her father had never refused her anything
she at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the cuff the stuff which is in fashion the color which is becoming that science which makes ofthe parisian woman something so charming so deep and soda nger ous
the words head yw oman were invented for the parisienne
in less than a month little cosette in that the bai do fthe rue de babylon ewa snot only one of the prettiest but one of the best dressed women in paris which means agreat deal more
she would have liked to encounter her passerby to see what he would say and to teach him ales son
the truth is that she was ravishing in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from gerard and one from her ba uti nthe most marvellous way
jean valjean watched the sera va ges with anxiety
he who felt that he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most beheld wings sprouting on cosette
moreover from the mere inspection of cosette 's toilet a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother
certain little proprieties certain special conventional it ies were not observed by cosette
amo the rfor instance would have to ldh erth at a young girl does not dress in damask
the first day that cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle and her white crap ebon net she took jean valjean 's arm gay radiant rosy proud dazzling
father she said how do you like me in this guise
jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious mancha rmin g
he was the same as usual during the ir walk
onthe irre turn home he asked cosette won't you put on that other gown and bonnet again you know the ones i mean
this took place in cosette 's chamber
cosette turned towards the wardrobe where he rca stoff schoolgirl 's clothes were hanging
that disguise
said she
father what do you want me to do with it
ohno the idea
is hall never put on those horror saga in
with that machine on my head ihave the air of madame maddog
jean valjean heaved a deep sigh
from that moment for thhe notice dth at cosette who had always heretofore asked to remain at home saying father ie nj oy myself more here with you now was always asking to go out
infact what is the use of having a handsome face and adel icious costume if one does not display the m
heals on otice dth at cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden
now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the rail edf ence
jean valjean who was shyne verse tfo oti nthe garden
he kept to his backyard like a dog
cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace of ignoring it
an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuous ness is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along holding in her hand the key to paradise with out being conscious of it
but what she had lost in ingenuous grace she gained in pensive and serious charm
her whole person permeated with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed for tha splendid melancholy
it was a tth is epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her once more at the luxembourg
chapter vi the battle begun cosette in her shadow like marius in his was allready to take fire
destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together these two beings all charged and all languishing with the storm yel ect ric it yof passion these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash off ire
the glance has been so much abused in love romance sth at it has finally fallen into disrepute
one hardly dares to say nowadays that two beings fell in love because they looked at eachother
that is the way people do fallin love nevertheless and the only way
the rest is not hing but there stc ome saft erw ards
nothing is more real than the segre at shocks which two souls convey to eachother by the exchange of that spark
at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance which trouble dma riu smar ius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed cosette
he caused her the same good and the same evil
she had been in the habit of seeing him for along time and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere
marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to think marius handsome
but as he paid no attention to her the young man was nothing to her
still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth acha rmin gto neo fvo ice when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself badly when he walked ifyou like but with a grace that was all his own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed to be poor yet his air was fine
onthe day when the ire yes meta tlas tan dsa id to eachother those first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisp sco set ted id not immediately understand
she returned thoughtfully to the house in the rue de l' ouest where jean valjean according to his custom had come to spend six weeks
the next morning on waking she thought of that strange young man solo ngi ndiff erent and icy who now seemed to pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her
she was on the contrary somewhat incense dat this handsome and disdainful individual
as ubs trat umo fwa rst irre dwi thin her
it struck her and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge atlas t
knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon
women play with the irb eau tyas children do with a knife
the yw ound themselves
the reader will recall marius ' hesitation shi spa lpi tations his terror s
here maine do nhis bench and did not approach
this vexed cosette
one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about alittle in that direction
seeing that marius did not come to her she went to him
in such cases all women resemble mahomet
and the nst range to say the first symptom of truelove in a young man is timidity in a young girl itis boldness
this is surprising and yet nothing is more simple
it is the two sexes tending to approach eachother and assuming each theother 's qualities
that day cosette 's glanced rove marius beside himself and marius ' glance set cosette to trembling
marius went away confident and cosette uneasy
from that day for tht hey adored eachother
the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy
it seemed to her that he rso ul had become black since the day before
she nolonger recognized it
the white ness of soul in younggirls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow
it melts in love which is it ssu n
cosette did not know what love was
she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense
onthe books of profane music which entered the convent amour love was replaced by tambour drum or pando ur
this created enigma sw hich exercise dthe imagination soft hebig girls such as a hho wde light ful is the drum
or pity is not a pan do ur
but cosette had left the convent to oea rly to have occupied herself much with the drum
therefore she did not know what name to give to what she now felt
is anyone the less ill because one does not know the name of one 's malady
she loved with all the more passion because she loved ignorant ly
she did not know whether it was a good thing or a bad thing useful or dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited she loved
she would have been greatly astonished had anyone said to her you do not sleep
but that is forbidden
you do not eat
why that is very bad
you have oppression sand palpitations of the heart
that must not be
you blush and turn pale when acer tain being clad in black appears at the end of acer tain green walk
but that is abominable
she would not have understood and she would have replied what fault is the re of mine in a matter in which ihave no power and of which iknow nothing
it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suite dto the state of her soul
it was a sort of admiration at a distance am ute contemplation the deification of astra nger
it was the apparition of youth to you tht he dream of nights become a reality yet remaining adr eam the long edf orphan to mr eal ized and made flesh atlas tbu tha ving as yet neither name nor fault nor spot nor exige nce nord efect in a word the distant love rwho lingered in the ideal achim aera with a form
any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister
she had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined
the spirit of the convent with which she had been permeated for the space of five years was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything trembl ear ound her
in this situation he was not a lover he was not even an admirer he was avision
she set herself to adoring marius as something charming luminous and impossible
as extreme innocence borders on extreme coquet rys he smiled at him with all frankness
everyday she looked forward to the hour for the ir walk with impatience she found marius the reshef elt herself unspeakably happy and thought i nall sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean what adel icious garden that luxembourg is
marius and cosette were in the dark as to one another
the ydi dno tadd res seach other they did not salute eachother the ydi dno tkn owe a cho the rthe ysa we acho the rand like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at eachother
it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed beautiful and loving with a consciousness of her beauty and in ignorance of her love
she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance
chapter vii to one sadness oppose as a dnes sand aha lfa lls it uations have the irin sti ncts
old and eternal mothernature warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius
jean valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul
jean valjean saw nothing knew nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction and onthe other something which was crumbling away
marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god by that same mothernature did all he could to keep out of sight of the father
nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes espied him
marius 'm an ners were nolonger in the least natural
he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward daring
he nolonger came quite close to the mas formerly
he seated himself at a distance and pretended to be reading why did he pretend that
formerly he had come in his old coat now he wore his new one everyday jean valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore gloves in short jean valjean cordially detested this young man
cosette allowed nothing to be divine d
without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that the rewa sso meth in gini tan dth at it must be concealed
the rewa saco incidence between the taste for the toilet which had recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by that strange rw hich was very repugnant to jean valjean
it might be accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident
he never opened his mouth to cosette about this strange r
one day however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague despair which suddenly cast sthe lead into the depths of its despair he said to her what avery pedantic air that you ngm an has
cosette but aye arb efore only an indifferent little girl would have replied why no heis charming
ten years later with the love of marius in her heart she would have answered ape dan tandi nsu ffe rable to the sight
you are right

she had not noticed him
it is iw hoh a vep oint ed him out to her
oh simplicity of the old
oh the depth of children
it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacle sth at the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever and that the young man falls into everyone
jean valjean had instituted a nun declared war against marius which marius with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine
jean valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg marius dashed headlong into all the ses nares and to all the interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he ingenuous lya nswere dyes
but cosette remained immu red in her apparent unconcern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean arrived at the following conclusion that ninny is madly in love with cosette but cosette does not even know that he exists
nonetheless did he bear in his heart amour nfu ltr emo r
the minute when cosette would love might strike at any moment
does not everything begin with indifference
onlyonce did cosette make a mistake and alarm him
her ose from his seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what already
jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes
he who had finally come to believe himself in capable of a malevolent feeling experience dmo ments when marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more and he felt the old depth so fhi sso ul which had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up against that you ngm an
it almost seemed to him that unknown craters were forming in his bosom
what

he came creeping about smelling out examining trying
he came saying he y
why not
he came to prowl about his jean valjean 's life

jean valjean added yes that 's it

it was a dog scanning at hie f
the reader knows the rest
marius pursued his sense less course
one day he followed cosette to the rue de l' ouest
another day he spoke to the porter
the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you
onthe morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius atlas tpe rce ive d

he swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg or in the rue de l' ouest

jean valjean had no experience of the semi series the only miseries which are charming and the only one swith which he was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the graves ign if i can ceo fco set te 's silence

three months had elapsed
marius nolonger went there
marius was not there
onthe following day jean valjean asked cosette again would you like to come to the luxembourg
she replied sadly and gently no
jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and heartbroken at this gentleness
what was going on in that mind which was so you ngan dye t already so impenetrable
what was on its way there with in
what was taking place in cosette 's soul
sometimes instead of going to be dj ean valjean remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed whole night sask in ghi msel fw hatha sco set tein her mind
and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about
oh

how here gret ted his abnegation and his folly in having brought cosette back into the world poor her oof sacrifice seized and hurled to the earth by his very self devotion
how he said to himself what have ido ne
however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette
no ill temper no harshness
his face was always serene and kind
jean valjean 's manners were more tender and more paternal than ever
if anything could have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increase dsu avi ty
on her side cosette languished
she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being conscious of it
when jean valjean ceased to take her on the irc us to mary stroll safe mini nein sti nctm urm ured confused lya tthe bottom of her heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and that if this proved to be a matter of indifference to her her father would take her thither once more
but days weeks months elapsed
jean valjean had tacitly accepted cosette 's tacit consent
she regretted it
it was too late
soma riu shad disappeared all was over
the day on which she returned to the luxembourg marius was nolonger the re
what was to be done
should she ever find him again
she felt an anguish at her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented everyday she nolonger knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than the tuileries whether the line nw hich the laundress brought home was starched to om uch or not enough whether to us saint haddon eher marketing well or ill and she remained dejected absorbed attentive to but as in gle thought he reyes vague and staring as when one gazes by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished
however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this except her pallor
she still wore her sweet face for him
this pallor suffice dbu ttoo thoroughly to trouble jean valjean
sometimes he asked her what is the matter with you
she replied the reis nothing them at ter with me

jean valjean was sitting in across walk on some plan ksde posited a tthe gate of a timber yard

the rear emed itation sw hich maybe called vertical when one is a tthe bottom of the mtime is required to return to earth
jean valjean had plunged into one of the sere verie s
he was thinking of cosette of the happiness that was possible if nothing came between him and her ofthe light with which she filled his life alight which was but the emanation of her soul
he was almost happy in his rever y
cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the clouds as the yt urn ed rosy
all at once cosette exclaimed father is hould think someone was coming yonder
jean valjean raised his eyes
cosette was right
the causeway which leads to the ancient barrier edu maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de sevres and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard
atthe elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard an oise which it was difficult to account for a tth at hour and as orto fcon fused pile made it sapp ear an ce
some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road

she did not understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at length she cried father

jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed
such encounters are shocks and the memory that the yle ave behind the mres embl esat horo ugh shaking up

jean valjean did violence to his habits and took cosette to see the sere joi cing sfor the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her
the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniform sper fect lyn atural jean valjean donned his uniform of an ational guard with the vague in ward feeling of a man who is beta king himself to shelter
however this trip seemed to attain its object
cosette who made it her law to please her father and to whom moreover all spectacles were an ove lty accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pout to odis dain fully at that flutter of enjoyment called a public fetes otha tje an valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that not race of that hideous vision remained
someday slater one morning when the sun was shining brightly and the yw ere both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that negligent attire of early morning which envelops younggirls in an adorable way and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting to the gentle glance soft he tender oldman she was picking a daisy to pieces
cosette did not know the delightful legend ilove alittle passionately etc
who was the re who could have taught her
she was handling the flower instinctively innocent ly with out as us pic ion that to pluck a daisy apart is to do the same by a heart
if the re were a fourth and smiling grace called melancholy she would have worn the air of that grace

onthe day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning calm as was his wont but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a burn and which he explained in some way or other
this wound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever
he would not call in a doctor
when cosette urged him call the dog doctors aid he
cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such an gel ich appin essa tbe in gof use to him that jean valjean felt all his former joy returning his fears and anxieties dissipating and he gazed at cosette saying oh

cosette on perceiving that he rfa the rwa sill had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the backcourt yard
she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and read to him the book sw hich he desired

insensibly and without her suspecting the fact the blackness departed from her spirit

cosette was nolonger sad

in the morning about ten o'clock after breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy

this figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was the nca lled an elegant the hat was of goods hap ethe coat blackwell cut probably off in ecl otha nd well fitted in a tthe waist
the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath the hat the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light
the profile had a rose in its mouth
this second form was well known to gav roche it was montparnasse
he could have to ldn othing about the other except that he was a respectable oldman

he was enjoying himself immensely
he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of aspect at or

it is less disagreeable to be an honest man

and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the latter 's hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it

book fifth
the end of which does not resemble the beginning chapter is olit ude and the barracks combined cosette 's grief which had been so poignant and lively four or five months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered upon its convalescence
nature spring youth love for her father the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop in to that soul which was so virgin and so you ng
was the fire wholly extinct the re
or was it merely that layers of ashes had formed
the truth is that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer
one day she suddenly thought of marius why
said she in olo nger think of him
that same week she noticed a very handsome office rofl an cers with a wasp like waist adel icious uniform the cheeks of a young girl as word under his arm waxed mustaches and a glazed sch apka passing the gate
moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes around face was vain insolent and goodlooking quite the reverse of marius
he had a cigar in his mouth
cosette thought that this office rd ou btl essb elong edt other eg iment in barracks in the rue de babylon e
onthe following day she saw him pass again
she took note of the hour
from that time for th was it chance
she saw him pass nearly every day
the office r 's comrades perceived that the rewa sin that badly kept garden behind that malicious rococo fence avery pretty creature who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant who is not unknown to the reader and whose name was the odu leg ill enorm and passed by
see here
the ysa id to him there 's alittle creature the re who is making eyes at you look
have it het ime replied the lancer to look at all the girls who look at me
this was a tthe precise moment when marius was descending heavily towards a go nyan dwa ssa ying if i could but see her before i die
had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and he would have expired with grief
whose fault was it
noone 's
marius possessed one of those temperament sw hich bury themselves in sorrow and the rea bid ecos ette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again
cosette was more overpass in gth rough that dangerous period the fatal phase of feminine rever ya band on edt oit self inwhich the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling as chance direct sto the capital of a marble column or to the post of a wine shop arap ida nd decisive moment critical for every orphan be sheri chor poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice misa lli ances are made in very high circles real misa lli an ceis that of souls and as many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune is a marble column which bears up at empleo fgr and sentiments and grand ideas so such an dsu chaman of the world satisfied and opulent who has polished boots and varnished words if looked at no touts ide but inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is not hing more than a block obscure lyh aunt ed by violent unclean and vinous passion sthe post of a drinking shop
what did cosette 's soul contain
passion calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid brilliant trouble dto acer tain depth and gloomy lower down

chapter ii cosette 's apprehension sdu ring the first fortnight in april jean valjean to oka journey
this as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals
here maine dabs ent ada yor two days at the utmost
where did he go
noone knew not even cosette
once only on the occasion of one of the sede part ures she had accompanied him in a hackney coach as far as a little blind alley at the corner of which she read impasse del apla nch ette
the re heal ight edan dthe coach to okc oset teba ckt other ued eba by lone
it was usually when money was lacking in the house that jean valjean to okt he sel it tle trips
so jean valjean was absent
he had said is hall return in three days
that evening cosette was alone in the drawing room
inorder to get rid of her ennui she had opened her piano organ and had begun to sing accompanying herself the while the chorus from eur yan the hunters astray in the wood
which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music
when she had finished she remained wrapped in thought
all at once it seemed to her that she heard the sound of footsteps in the garden
it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint she was in bed and it was ten o'clock at night
she stepped to the shutter of the drawing room which was closed and laid her ear against it
it seemed to her that it was the tread of amana ndt hath ewa swa lk in gv ery softly
she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened as mall wicket in her shutter and peeped into the garden
the moon was a tthe full
everything could be seen as plainly as by day
the rewa sno one there
she opened the window
the garden was absolutely calman dall that was visible was that the street was deserted asus ual
cosette thought that she had been mistaken
she thought that she had heard an oise
it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the mind terrified depth sw hich trembl esb efore the gaze like a dizzy forest and inwhich one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight
she thought no more about it
moreover cosette was not very timid by nature
the reflow edin her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventures sw hor uns barefoot
it will be remembered that she was more of a lark than a dove
the rewa saf oundation of wildness and bravery in her
onthe following day at an earlier hour towards nightfall she was strolling in the garden
in the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant as ound similar to that of the preceding evening as though someone were walking beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told her self that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she paid no heed to it
besides she could see nothing
she emerged from the thickets he had still to cross as mall law nto regain the steps
the moon which had just risen behind her cast cosette 's shadow infront of her upon this law nass he came out from the shrubbery
cosette halted in alarm
beside her shadow the moon outlined distinctly upon the turf another shadow which was particularly startling and terrible as had oww hich had around hat
it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery afew pace sin there a rof cosette
she stood for a moment without the power to speak or cryor call or stir or turn her head
the nsh esu mmo ned up all her courage and turned round resolutely
the rewa sno one there
she glanced on the ground
the figure had disappeared
she reentered the thickets earch edt he corner sbo ldl yw ent as far as the gate and found nothing
she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror
was this another hallucination
what
two days in succession
one hallucination might pass but two hallucinations
the disquieting point about it was that the shadow had assured lyn otb een apha nto m
phantom sdo not wear round hats
onthe following day jean valjean returned
cosette to ldh im what she thought she had heard and see n
she wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are alittle goose
jean valjean grew anxious
it can not be anything said he
he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw him examining the gate with great attention
during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly heard someone walking close to the flight of steps beneath her window
she ran to her little wicket and opened it
in point of fact there was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand
just as she was about to scream the moonlight edu pthe man 's profile
it was her father
she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy
jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding night sin the garden
cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter
onthe third night the moon was on the wane and had begun to rise later at one o'clock in the morning possibly she heard aloud burst of laughter and her father 's voice calling her cosette
she jumped out of bed threw on her dressing gown and opened her window
her father was standing on the grass plot below
ihave wake dyo ufo rthe purpose of reassuring you said he look there is your shadow with the round hat
and he pointed out to her on the turf as had owc as tb ythe moon and which did indeed be a rcon siderable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing a round hat
it was the shadow produced by achim ney pipe of sheet iron with a hood which rose above an eigh boring roof
cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious supposition swer eal layed and the next morning as she was a tbr ea kfa st with her father she made me rr yo vert he sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney pots
jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney pot was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thoughts he had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky
she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of achim ney pot which is afraid of being caught in the act and which retires when someone looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this
cosette 's serenity was fully restored
the proof appeared to her to be complete and it quite vanished from her mind whether the reco uld possibly be anyone walking in the garden during the evening or at night
afew days later however afresh in cide nto ccu rre d
chapter iii enriched with commentaries by toussaint in the garden near the railing on the street there was aston eben chsc re ened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of yoke elms but which could incase of necessity be reached by an arm from the outside past the trees and the gate
one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown
the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating anobject less sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows from the mystery of the tomb which is a jar at that hour
perhaps fantin ewa swithin that shadow
cosette roses low lym ade the tour of the garden walking on the grass drenched in dewan dsa ying to herself through the species of melancholy so mna mb uli smi nw hich she was plunged really one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour
one takes cold
she returned to the bench
as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot which she had quitted at ole rab lyla rge stone which had evidently not been there a moment before
cosette gazed at the stone asking her self what it meant
all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself that someone had placed it there that an arm had been thrust through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her
this time the fear was genuine the stone was the re
no doubt was possible she did not touch it fled with out glancing behind her to ok refuge in the house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and barth edo or like window opening on the flight of steps
she inquired of toussaint has my father returned yet
not yet mademoiselle
wehave already noted on cef oral lthe fact that toussaint stuttered
may web eperm it ted to dispense with it for the future
the musical notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us
jean valjean at hough tfu lma nand given to nocturnal stroll soften returned quite late at night
toussaint went on cosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutter so pen in gon the garden atleast with bars in the evening and to put the little iron things in the little rings that close the m
oh
be easy on that score miss
toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the fact but she could not refrain from adding it is so solitary here
sofa rast hat is concerned said to us saint it is true
we might be assassinated before we had time to say ouf
and monsieur does not sleep in the house to boot
but fear nothing miss if asten the shutter sup like prisons
lone women
that is enough to make one shudder ibe lieve you
just imagine what if you were to see me nent ery our chamber at night and say ' hold your tongue
' and begin to cut your throat
it 's not the dying so much you die for one must die and that 's allright it 's the abomination of feeling those people to uch you
and the nth eir knives the yca n't beable to cut well with the m
ah good gracious
be quiet said cosette
fast en everything thoroughly
cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week which recurred to her memory dared not even say to her go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench
for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter
she saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened made to us saint goal love rthe house from garrett oce lla rloc ked herself up in her own chamber bolted her door looked under her couch went to be dan dsl ept badly
all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full of caverns
at sunrise the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terror soft hepa stn ight and our laughter is indirect proportion to our terror which the yha vec aus ed at sunrise cosette when she woke viewed her fright as an ight mar eand said to herself what have ibe ent hink in gof
it is like the footsteps that it hough ti heard a week or two ago in the garden at night
it is like the shadow of the chimney pot
ami becoming a coward
the sun which was glowing through the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts event heston e
the rewa snom or easton eon the bench than the rewa saman in around hatin the garden id reamed about the stone as i did all the rest
she dressed herself descended to the garden rant othe bench and broke out in a cold perspiration
the stone was the re
but this last edon lyf or a moment
that which is terror by night is curiosity by day
bah
said she come let us see what it is
she lifted the stone which was tolerably large
beneath it was something which resembled a letter
it was a white envelope
cosette seized it
the rewa sno address on one side nose alon the other
yet the envelope though unsealed was not empty
papers could be seen in side
cosette examined it
it was nolonger alarm it was nolonger curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety
cosette drew from the envelope its contents alittle notebook of paper each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in avery fine and rather pretty handwriting as cosette thought
cosette looked for an amet here was none
to whom was this address ed
to her probably since aha nd had deposited the packet on her bench
from whom did it come
an irresistible fascination to ok possession of her she tried to turn away here yes from the leaflets which were trembling in her hands he gazed at the sky the street the acacia sall bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over an eigh boring roof and the nhe rgl ances ud den lyfe llu pont heman us crip tan dsh esa id to herself that she must know what it contained
this is what she read

love is the salutation of the angels to the stars
how sad is the soul when it is sad through love

oh
how true it is that the beloved being becomes god
one could comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not go dthe father of all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love
the glimpse of a smile beneath a white crap ebon net with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams
god is behind everything but everything hide sgod
things are black creatures are opaque

ihave sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men
god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give the men dles sdu ratio n
after a life of love an eternity of love is infact an augmentation but to increase in intensity event heine ffa ble felicity which love best ows on the soul even in this world is impossible even to go d
god is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude of man

love so ar
onthe day when a woman ass hepa sses before you emits light as she walks you are lost you love
but one thing remains for you to do to think of her so intently that she is constrained to think of you
what love commences can be finished by god alone
truelove is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes
it is composed both of the infinite ly great and the infinite ly little

what agra ndt hing it is to be loved

if the red id note xis tso me one who loved the sun would be come extinct
chapter vcos ette after the letter as cosette read she gradually fell into thought
atthe very moment when she raised here yes from the last line of the notebook the handsome office rpa ssed triumphantly infront of the gate it was his hour cosette thought him hideous
she resumed her contemplation of the book
it was written in the most charming of chiro graph yth ought cosette in the same hand but with divers in ks sometimes very black again whitish as when i nk has been added to the inks tanda ndc on sequently on different days
it was the namin dwh ich had unfolded itself there sigh by sigh irregularly without order without choice without object haphazard
cosette had never read anything like it
this manuscript in which she already perceived more light than obscurity produced upon her the effect of a half open sanctuary
each one of the sem yst eri ous lines shone before her eyes and inundated her heart with a stranger adia nce
the education which she had received had always talked to her ofthe soul and never of love very much as one might talk of the firebrand and not ofthe flame
this manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweet lyre vealed to her all of love sorrow destiny life eternity the beginning the end
it was a sif aha nd had opened and suddenly flung upon her aha ndf ulo fray so flight

this had been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven
the selin es which had fallen on eby one on the paper were what might be called drops of soul
now from whom could these pages come
who could have penned the m
cosette did not hesitate am omen t

while she was forgetful of him he had found her again
but had she forgotten him

she was foolish to have thought so for a single moment
she had always loved him always adored him
the fire had been smothered and had smo uld ered for a time but she saw all plainly now it had but made headway and now it had burst forth afresh and had inflamed her whole being
this notebook was like a spark which had fallen from that others oul into her s
she felt the conflagration starting upon cem or e
she imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript oh yes
said she how perfectly irec ognize all that
that is what i had already read in his eyes

she turned away as in shame and indignation
she would gladly have thrown something at his head
she fled reentered the house and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript on cem or etol earn it by heart and to dream
when she had thoroughly master edit she kissed it and put it in her bosom
all was over cosette had fallen back into deep seraphic love
the abyss of eden had yawned once more
all day long cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment
she scarcely thought he ride as were in the state of a tangled skein in her brain she could not manage to conjecture anything she hoped through a tremor what
vague things
she dared make herself no promises and she did not wish to refuse herself anything

the nsh efe lto fthe dear paper with in her bosom under her gown she pressed it to her heart she felt it sang les against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy which overflowed from beneath her eyelids
oh yes
she thought it is certainly he
this comes from him and is for me
and she told her self that an intervention of the angels ace lest i alch an ceh a dgi ven him back to her

that celestial chance that intervention of the angels was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief from the charlemagne courtyard to the lion 's ditch over the roof so fla for ce
chapter vi old people are made to go out opportune ly when evening came jean valjean went out cosette dressed herself
she arranged her hair in the most becoming manner and she put on adress whose bodice had received on esn ipo fthe scissors to om uch and which through this slope permitted aview of the beginning of her throat and was a syo ung girls say at rifle indecent
it was not in the least indecent but it was prettier than usual
she made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so
did she meant ogo out
no
was she expecting a visitor
no
at dusk she went down to the garden
toussaint was busy in her kitchen which opened on the backyard
she began to stroll about under the trees thrusting aside the branches from time to time with her hand because the re were some which hung very low
in this manner she reached the bench
the stone was still there
she sat down and gently laid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it
all at once she experienced that indefinable impression which one undergoes when the reiss omeo nest and in gbe hind one even when she does not see the person
she turned her head and rose to her feet
it was he
his head was bare
he appeared to have grown thin and pale
his black clothes were hardly discernible
the twilight threw a wanli ght on his fine brow and covered his eyes in shadows

the barber wheeled round with a furious look and without abandoning his razor thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee and slammed his door saying the idea of coming in and freezing everybody for nothing

it was an elephant for tyf eet high constructed of timber and masonry bearing on its back at ower which resembled a house former ly painted green by some dauber and now painted black by heaven the wind and time

it was towards this corner of the place dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street lamp that the gaming uide dhis two brats
the reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality and that twenty years ago the tribunal swer ecal led upon to judge under the charge of vagabond age and mutilation of a public monument ach il dwh ohad been caught asleep in this very elephant of the bastille
this fact noted we proceed
on arriving in the vicinity of the colossus ga vro chec omp re hende dthe effect which the infinite ly great might produce on the infinite lys mall and said don ' tbe scared infants

the two children somewhat frightened followed ga vro chew it hout uttering a word and confided themselves to this little providence in rags which had given the mbr eada nd had promised them as he lter
the re extended along the fence lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring timber yard
gav rocher aise dit with remarkable vigor and placed it again stone of the elephant 's forelegs
near the point where the ladder ended as orto fbla ckh ole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished
gav roche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests and said to the mcl im bupa nd goin

exclaimed ga vro che
and head de dyo us hall see
he clasped the rough lego fthe elephant and in a twinkling without deign in gto make use of the ladder he had reached the aperture
he entered it as an adder slips through a crevice and disappeared within and an instant later the two children saw his head which looked pale appear vaguely on the edge of the shadow yh ole like a wan and whitish spectre

he exclaimed climb up young ' uns
you 'll see how snug it is here
come up you
he said to the elder i'll lend you aha nd
the little fellow snu dge de acho the rthe gamin frightened and inspired the mwi thc on fidence at one and the same time and the nit was raining very hard
the elder one undertook the risk
the younger on seeing his brother climbing up and himself left alone between the paws of this huge beast felt great lyin cline dto cry but he did not dare
the elder lad climbed with uncertain steps up the rungs of the ladder ga vro chein the meanwhile encouraging him with exclamation slike a fencing master to his pupils or amulet eer to his mule s
don't be afraid
that 's it
come on
put your feet there

boldly
and when the child was within reach he seized him suddenly and vigorously by the armand pulled him towards him
nabbed
said he
the brat had passed through the crack
now said ga vro chew a itf or me

and making his way out of the hole as he had entered it he slipped down the elephant 's leg with the agility of amon key landed on his feet in the grass grasped the child of five round the body and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder the nhe began to climb up behind him shouting to the elder i'm going to boost him do you tug
and in another instant the small lad was pushed dragged pulled thrust stuffed into the hole before he had time to recover himself and gav roche entering behind him and re pulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on the grass began to clap his hands and to cry here we are

gav roche was a thome in fact
oh unforeseen utility of the useless
charity of great things
goodness of giants
this huge monument which had embodied an idea of the emperor 's had become the box of a street urchin
the brat had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus
the bourgeois decked out in the irs und a yf in ery who passed the elephant of the bastille were fond of saying as the ysc anne dit disdainfully with the irp romine nte yes what 's the good of that
it served to save from the cold the frost the hail and rain to shelter from the wind so fwi nter to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever and from slumber in the snow which produces death alittle being who had no father no mother no bread no clothes nor ef uge
it served to receive the innocent who mso ciety repulsed
it served to diminish public crime
it was a lair open to one against whom all doors were shut
it seemed as though the miserable old mastodon invaded by vermin and oblivion covered with warts with mould and ulcers tottering worm eaten abandoned condemned as orto fme ndi can tco loss usa skin gal msi nva in with a benevolent look in the midst of the crossroads had taken pity on that other mendicant the poor pygmy who roamed without shoes to his feet without a roof over his head blowing on his fingers clad in rags fed on rejected scraps
that was what the elephant of the bastille was good for
this idea of napoleon disdained by men had been taken back by god
that which had been merely illustrious had become a ugust
inorder to realize his thought the emperor should have had porphyry brass iron gold marble the old collection of planks beams and plaster suffice dfor god
the emperor had had the dream of age niu sin that titanic elephant armed prodigious with trunk uplifted bearing its tower and scattering on all sides its merry and vivi fying water she wished to incarnate the people

and plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well acquainted with his apartment she took a plan kand stopped up the aperture

fragments which had fallen from the elephant 's back into his belly had filled up the cavity so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor
the smaller child nestled up against his brother and whispered to him it 's black
this remark drew an exclamation from ga vro che
the petrified air of the two brats rendered some shock necessary

the two children drew close to gav roche
gav roche paternally touched by this confidence passed from grave to gentle and addressing the smaller stupid said he accenting the insulting word with a caressing intonation it 's outside that it is black

and he snuffed out his tiny light
hardly had the light been extinguished when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay
it consisted of a multitude of dull scratches which produced a metallic sound as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire
this was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries
the little five year old boy on hearing this hubbub overhead and chilled with terror jogged his brother 's elbow but the elder brother had already shut his peepers as ga vro che ha do rder ed

darkness covered the vast place de la bastille
awi ntry gale which mingled with the rain blew in gusts the patrol search eda llt he doorways all eys enclosures and obscure nooks and in the irs earch for nocturnal vagabonds the ypa ssed in silence before the elephant the monster erect motionless staring open eyed into the shadows had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed and sheltered from heaven and from menthe three poor sleeping children
inorder to understand what is about to follow the reader must remember that at that epoch the bastille guardhouse was situated at the other end of the square and that what to ok place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel
towards the end of that hour which immediately precedes the dawn amant urn edf rom the rue saint antoine at a run made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july and glided between the paling sun til he was underneath the belly of the elephant
if any light had illuminated that man it might have been divine dfr omt he thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain
arrived beneath the elephant he uttered a peculiar cry which did not belong to any human tongue and which aparo que tal one could have imitated
twice here peated this cryo fw hose orthography the following barely conveys an idea kiri kiki ou
atthe second cry acle ary oung merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant yes
almost immediately the plan kwh ich closed the hole was drawn aside and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant 's leg and fell briskly near the man
it was ga vro che

as for his cry of kiri kiki out hat was doubtless what the child had meant when he said you will ask for monsieur ga vro che
on hearing it heh a dwa ked with a start had crawled out of his alcove pushing apart the netting alittle and carefully drawing it together again the nhe had opened the trap and descended

the new building which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world was the weak point in the prison
the walls were eaten by salt petre to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in the irb eds

before any sound had reached the watcher who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened in to the dormitory the wall had been pierced the chimney scale dthe iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the flue for ceda ndt he two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof
the wind and rain redoubled the roof was slippery

the yha dsus tained no other damage however than that of scratching nearly all the skin of fthe ir hands
that night the nardi erw as warned without any one being able to explain how and was not asleep
towards one o'clock in the morning then i ght being very dark he saw two shadows passalong the roof in the rain and squalls infront of the dormer window which was opposite his cage
one halted at the window long enough to dart in a glance
this was brujo n
the nardi err eco gni zed him and understood
this was enough
the nardi err at edas abu rgl aran dde tained as a measure of precaution under the charge of organizing an oct urna lamb us hwi thar med force was kept in sight
the sentry who was relieved every two hours march edu pan ddo wn infront of his cage with loaded musket
the fine air was lighted by a skylight
the prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds
everyday at four o'clock in the afternoon ajai le resco rted by two dogs this was still in vogue at that time entered his cage deposited beside his bed al oaf of black bread weighing two pounds a jug of water abo wlf ill ed with rather thin bouillon in which swam a few may agan beans inspected his iron sand tapped the bars
this man and his dogs made two visits during the night
the nardi erh ado bta in edp ermis sion to keep as orto fir on bolt which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserve it from the rats ashes aid
as the nardi erw ask ept insight no objection had been made to this spike
still it was remembered afterwards that one of the jailer shad said it would be better to let him have only a wooden spike
at two o'clock in the morning these nti nel who was an old soldier was relieved and replaced by a conscript
afew moments later the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything except possibly the excessive you than dthe rustic air of the raw recruit
two hours after wards at four o'clock when the yca met or elie vet he conscript he was found asleep on the floor lying like a log near the nardi er 's cage
as for the nardi erh ewa sno longer there
the rewa sah ole in the ceiling of his cage and above it another hole in the roof
one of the plan ks of his bed had been wrenched of fan dpr oba bly carried away with him as it was not found
the yal so seized in his cell aha lfe mpt yb ott lew hich contained the remains of the stupefying wine with which the soldier had been drugged
the soldier 's bayonet had disappeared
atthe moment when this discovery was made it was assumed that the nardi erw as out of reach
the truth is that he was nolonger in the new building but that he was still in great danger
the nardi eron reaching the roof of the new building had found the remains of brujo n ' s rope hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney but as this broken fragment was much to osho rthe had not been able to escape by the outer wall as brujo nand gue leme rha ddo ne
when one turns from the rue de sba lle tsin to the rue du roi de sic ile one almost immediately encounters are puls iver uin
the rest ood on that spot in the last century aho use of which only the back wall now remains are gular wall of masonry which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings
this ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen the re them id dle one that nearest the right gable is barred with a worm eaten beam adjusted like a pro p
through the sew in dows the rewa sfor me rly visible aloft yand lugubrious wall which was a fragment of the outer wall of la force
the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half filled by a fence of rotten boards shore dup by five stone posts
in this recess lies concealed alittle shanty which leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing
the fence has a gate which afew years ago was fastened on ly by a latch
it was the crest of this ruin that the nardi erh ads ucce ed edin reaching a little after one o'clock in the morning
how had he got the re
that is what noone has ever been able to explain or understand
the lightning must atthe sametime have hindered and helped him
had he made use of the ladder sands caff old in gso fthe slater sto get from roof to roof from enclosure to enclosure from compartment to compartment to the building soft he charlemagne court then to the building soft he saint louis court to the outer wall and the nce to the hut on the rue du roi de sic ile
but in that itinerary the re existed breaks which seemed to render it anim possibility
had he placed the plan kf rom his bed like a bridge from the roof of the fine air to the outer wall and crawled flat on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the hut
but the outer wall of la force for me dacre nella ted and unequal line it mounted and descended it dropped at the firemen 's barracks it rose towards the bathhouse it was cut in twain by building sit was not even ofthe same height on the hotel la moi gno nason the rue pave ee very where occurred falls and right angles and the nth ese nti nels must have espied the dark for mof the fugitive hence the route taken by the nardi erst ill remains rather inexplicable
in two manner sfl ight was impossible
had the nardi ers purred on by that thirst for liberty which changes precipices into ditches iron bars in to wattles of osier ale gles sma nint oana thle tea gouty man in to a bird stupidity in to instinct instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius had the nardi erin vented at hird mode
noone has ever found out
the marvels of escape can not always be accounted for
the man who makes his escape were peat is inspired the reiss ome thing of the star and ofthe lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight the effort to ward sde live rance is no less surprising than the flight towards the sublime and one says ofthe escaped thief how did he contrive to scale that wall
in the same way that one says of corneille where did he find the means of dying
at all events dripping with perspiration drenched with rain with his clothes hanging in ribbons his hands flayed his elbows bleeding his knees to rnt he nardi erh adr each ed what children in the irf igu rative language call the edge of the wall of the ruin the re he had stretched himself out at full length and the re his strength had failed him
as tee pesca rpm ent three stories high separate dhi mfr omt hepa vem ent of the street
the rope which he had was too short
the re he waited pale exhausted desperate with all the despair which he had undergone still hidden by the night but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of saint paul strike four within a few minutes an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roofs tarin gin horror at a terrible depth at the light of the street lanterns the wet black pavement that pavement long edf or yet frightful which meant death and which meant liberty
he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded ifthe yha dhea rd him and if the yw ould come to his assistance
he listened
with the exception of the patrol noone had passed through the streets in ceh ehad beenthere
nearly the whole of the descent of the market garden ers from montreuil from charon nef rom vincennes and from bercy to the market swa sacco mpl is he dth rough the rue saint antoine
four o'clock struck
the nardi ers hud dered
afew moments later that terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison
the sound of doors opening and shutting the creaking of gratings on the ir hinges at um ulti nthe guardhouse the hoarse shouts of the turnkey sthe shock of musket but tso nthe pavement of the court sre ached his ears

the ir helmets which the torchlight edu pint her ain went and came along the roof s
atthe sametime the nardi erp erc eiv edin the direction of the bastille awan whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise
he was on top of a wall ten inches wide stretched out under the heavy rains with two gulf stori ght and left unable to stir subject to the giddiness of a possible fall and to the horror of acer taina rre stand his thoughts like the pendulum of a clock swung from one of the seide as to the other dead if i fall caught if i stay
in the midst of this anguish he suddenly saw the street being still dark aman who was gliding along the walls and coming from the rue pave eha lti nthe recess above which the nardi erw as a sit were suspended
here this man was joined by a second who walked with the same caution the nb yat hird the nb yafo urth
when the semen were reunited one of the mli fte dthe latch of the gate in the fence and all four entered the enclosure in which the shanty stood

it must be added that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box

in the meanwhile the third man had intervened

how do we know that he does n't stand in need of us

but the night which was really growing too fine for the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted the cold which was overpowering the mthe irs oaked garments the ir hole ridden shoes the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison the hours which had elapsed the patrol which the yha den counter edt he hope which was vanishing all urged the mto beat are treat

an idea occurred to him alas tide a afl as hof inspiration he drew from his pocket the end of brujo n ' s rope which he had detached from the chimney of the new building and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence

an ancient plaster flue which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty informer times ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where the yc ould see the nardi er
this flue the nmu chd am aged and full of cracks has since fallen but the marks of it are still visible
it was very narrow

as soon as he touched the pavement as soon as he found himself out of danger he was nolonger either wear yor chilled or trembling the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more and stood erect and free ready to march onward

it is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark which signifies both to kill to assassinate and to plunder
to eat true sense to devour

where are we at this moment
in the land of slang
what is slang
it is a tone and the same time an ation and a dialect it is the fti nits two kinds people and language

it is the language of prisons galleys convicts of everything that is most abominable in society

people repeated what do authors mean by that revolting dialect
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who denies that
ofcourse it does
when it is a question of probing a wound agu lfa society since when has it been considered wrong to go to ofa r
to go to the bottom
wehave always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and atleast a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits
why should onenote xplore everything and study everything
why should one halton the way
the halt is a matter depending on the sound in glin eand not on the lead sma n
certainly too itis neither an attractive nora neas yt ask to undertake an investigation into the lowest depth soft he social order where terra firma comes to an end and where mud begins to rummage in those vague murky waves to follow up to seize and to fling still quivering upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when thus brought to the light that pus tul ous vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mire and the shadows
nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang

for it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case that argot is both alite rary phenomenon and asocial result

noone is a good historian of the patent visible striking and public life of people sif he is not at the same time in acer tain measure the historian of the ird eep and hidden life and noone is a good historian of the interior unless he understands how at need to be the historian of the exterior also
the history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events and this is true reciprocal ly

he would have been obliged to speak to cosette of her garter and that was impossible
this bordered on astra nget hemet he flesh before which that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright

during this time clouds passed above the ir heads
everytime that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than ofthe clouds of heaven
this chaste almost shy love was not devoid of gallantry by any means
top ayc omp lime nts to the woman who mama nlo ves is the first method of bestowing caresses and he is half audacious who tries it

voluptuousness mingles the re with its sweet tiny point while it hides its elf

cosette 's whole person was ingenuous ness ingenuity transparency whiteness can do rra dian ce
it might have been said of cosette that she was clear
she produced on those who saw her the sensation of april and dawn
the rewa sde win here yes
cosette was a condensation of the aurora lli ght in the form of a woman
it was quite simple that marius should admire her since he adored her

her prattle was conversation

it was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him
so epon in efo llow ed him without his suspecting the fact
she saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden
she approached the railing felt ofthe bars one after the other and readily recognized the one which marius had moved
she murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents none of that lisette
she seated herself on the underpinning of the railing close beside the bar as though she were guarding it
it was precisely at the point where the railing touched the neighboring wall
the rewa sad i mno ok there inwhich epon in ewa sent irel yc once a led
she remained thus for more than an hour without stirring and without breathing apr ey to her thoughts
towards ten o'clock in the evening one of the two or three persons who passed through the rue plume tan old belated bourgeois who was making has tet oes cape from this deserted spot of evil repute ashes kirt edt he garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall heard a dull and threatening voices ayin gi 'm nolonger surprised that he comes here every evening
the passerby cast a glance around him saw no one dared not peer into the black niche and was greatly alarmed
here double dhis pace
this passerby had reason to make haste for avery few instant slater six men who were marching separately and at some distance from eachother along the wall and who might have been taken for a gray patrol entered the rue plume t
the first to arrive at the garden railing halted and waited for the other sase cond lateral lsi xw ere reunited

the sixth who had not yet opened his lips now began to inspect the gate as epon in ehad done an hour earlier grasping each bar in succession and shaking the mca uti ously
thus he came to the bar which marius had loosened
as he was on the point of grasping this bar aha nde merged abruptly from the darkness fell upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast and a hoarse voice said to him but not loudly the re 's a dog
atthe same moment he perceived apa leg irls tandi ngb efore him

chapter vi marius becomes practical once more to the extent of giving cosette his address while this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the gate and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl marius was by cosette 's side
never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming the trees more trembling the odor of the grass more penetrating never had the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweet erno is ene ver had all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thoroughly to the inward music of love never had marius been more captivated more happy more ecstatic
but he had found cosette sadc oset teh adbe en weeping
here yes were red
this was the first cloud in that wonderful dream
marius ' first word had been what is the matter
and she had replied this
the nsh ehad seated herself on the bench near the steps and while he trembling lyt ook his place beside her she had continued my father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness because he has business and we may go away from here
marius shivered from head to foot
when one is a tthe end of one 's life to die means to go away when one is a tthe beginning of it to go away means to die
for the last six weeks marius had little by little slow ly by degrees taken possession of cosette each day
as we have already explained in the case of first love the soul is taken long before the body later on one takes the body long before the soul sometimes one does not take the soul at all the fau blas and the prudhomme sad dbe cause the reis none but the sarcasm is fortunately abla sphe my
soma riu spo sses sed cosette as spirits possess but he envelope dhe rw it hall his soul and seized her jealous ly with incredible conviction
he possessed her smile her breath her perfume the profound radiance of her blue eyes the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand the charming mark which she had on her neck all her thoughts
therefore he possessed all cosette 's dream s
he incessantly gazed at and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath the short locks on the nape of her neck and he declared to himself that the rewa snot one of those shorthair sw hich did not belong to him marius
he gazed upon and adored the things that she wore her knot of ribbon her gloves her sleeves her shoes her cuffs as sacred objects of which he was the master
he dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair and he even said to himself in confused and suppressed stammering so fvo lup tuo us ness which did not make the ir way to the light that the rewa snot arib bono fhe rgo wnn ota mesh in her stockings not a fold in her bodice which was not his
beside cosette he felt himself beside his own property his own thing his own despot and his slave

this is mine
no it is mine
ias sure you that you are mistaken
this is my property
what you are taking a syo uro wn is myself
marius was something that made apart of cosette and cosette was something which made apart of marius
marius felt cosette within him
to have cosette to possess cosette this to him was not to be distinguished from breathing
it was in the midst of this faith of this intoxication of this virgin possession unprecedented and absolute of this sovereignty that the sew or dsw ear ego in gawa yf ells ud den lya tab low and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him cosette is not yours
marius awoke
for six weeks marius had been living as we have said outside of life those words going away
caused him to reenter it harshly
he found not a word to say
cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold
she said to him in her turn what is the matter
here plied in solo wat one that cosette hardly hear dhi midi dno tunde rst and what you said
she began again this morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness that he would give me his line ntop uti nat run kth at hew as obliged to go on a journey that we were to go away that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and as mallon efor him and that all is to be ready in a week from now and that we might go to england
but this is outrageous
exclaimed marius
it is certain that at that moment no abuse of power nov iol ence not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants no action of busiris of tiberius or of henry viii
could have equal led this in atrocity in the opinion of marius m

he did not say when

he did not say when
marius rose and said coldly cosette shall you go
cosette turned toward him herbeau tiful eyes all filled with anguish and replied in a sort of bewilderment where
to england
shall you go
why do you say you to me
ias kyou whether you will go
what do you expect me to do
she said clasping her hands

very well said marius the niw ill go elsewhere
cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of the sew or ds
she turned so pale that he rfa ces hone white through the gloom
she stammered what do you mean
marius looked at her the nra is edh is eyes to heaven and answered nothing
when his eyes fell again he saw cosette smiling at him
the smile of a woman who mon elove spo sses sesa visible radiance even at night
how silly wear e

hehe ard behind him a faint stifled noise which was sweet yet sad
it was cosette sobbing
she had been weeping for more than two hours beside marius as he meditated
he came to her fell at her knees and slowly prostrating himself he took the tip of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe and kissed it
she let him have his way in silence

in the tone with which he uttered the sew or dst here lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil that cosette trembl ed
she felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by
the shock made her cease weeping
now listen said he donot expect me tomorrow
why
don ote xp ect me until the day after tomorrow

but that is impossible
let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives perhaps
and marius added in a low to nea ndi nana side heis aman who never change shisha bits and he has never received anyone except in the evening

when marius went forth the street was deserted
this was the moment when epon in ewa sfo llow in gthe ruffians to the boulevard
while marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree an idea had crossed his mind an idea alas
that he himself judge dto be senseless and impossible
he had come to a desperate decision

the fact is that the old man was deeply dejected

for four years he had been waiting for marius with his foot firmly planted that is the exact word in the conviction that that good for nothing you ngs camp would ring at his door someday or other now he had reached the point where a tce rtai ngl oom yh our she said to himself that if marius made him wait much longer it was not death that was insupportable to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never seem arius again
the idea of never seeing marius again had never entered his brain until that day now the thought began to recur to him and it chilled him

his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation
he had reached the point where amant ries to make up his mind and to accept that which rends his heart
he was explaining to himself that the rewa sno longer any reason why marius should return that if he intended to return he should have done it long ago that he must renounce the idea
he was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over and that he should die without having beheld that gentleman again
but his whole nature revolted his age dpat erni ty would not consent to this
well
said he this was his doleful refrain he will not return
his bald head had fallen upon his breast and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes on his heart h
in the very midst of his rever yh is old servant basque entered and inquired can monsieur receive m
marius
the old man sat up erect pallida nd like a corpse which rises under the influence of a galvanic shock
all his blood had retreated to his heart
he stammered m

a young man entered
it was marius
marius halted at the door as though waiting to be bidden to enter
his almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by the shade
nothing could be seen but his calm grave but strangely sad face
it was several minutes before father gillen or man ddu lled with amazement and joy could see anything except abri ght ness as when one is in the presence of an apparition
he was on the point of swooning he saw marius through a dazzling light
it certainly was he itc ert ain ly was marius

after the lapse of four years
he grasped him entire soto speak in asin gle glance
he found him noble handsome distinguished well grown acom plete man with a suitable mien and acha rmin gair
he felt a desire to open his arms to call him to fling himself forward his heart melted with rapture affectionate words swelled and overflowed his breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips and by a contrast which constitute dthe very foundation of his nature what came forth was harshness
he said abruptly what have you come here for
marius replied with embarrassment monsieur m
gillen or man dwo uld have liked to have marius throw himself into his arms
he was displeased with marius and with himself
he was conscious that he was brusque and that marius was cold
it caused the good man unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and for lorn within and only to be able to be hard outside
bitterness returned
he interrupted marius in a peevish to net he nw hyd i dyo uco me
that the nsi gni fied ifyou donot come to embrace me
marius looked at his grandfather who sep all or gave him a face of marble
monsieur have you come to be gm ypa rd on
do you acknowledge your fault s
he thought he was putting marius on the right road and that the child would yield
marius shivered it was the denial of his father that was required of him he dropped his eyes and replied no sir
the nex claimed the old man impetuously with a grief that was poignant and full of wrath what do you want of me
marius clasped his hands advanced as tep and said in a feeble and trembling voice sir have pity on me

sir said marius iknow that my presence is displeasing to you but i have come merely to ask one thing of you and the nisha llg oa way immediately

said the old man
who said that you were to go away
this was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of his heart as km ypa rd on

gillen or man dfe ltt hat marius would leave him in a few moments that his harsh reception had repelled the lad that his hardness was driving him away he said all this to himself and it augmented his grief and as his grief was straight way converted into wrath it increased his harshness
he would have liked to have marius understand and marius did not understand which made the good man furious
he began again what
you deserted me your grandfather you left myhouse to go noone know sw hither you drove your aunt to despair you went off it is easily guessed to lead a bachelor life it 's more convenient to play the dandy to come in a tall hours to amuse yourself you have given me no signs of life you have contracted debt swith out even telling me to pay the myo uha veb ecom eas masher of windows and a bluster era nda tthe end of four years you come to mean dth at isa lly ou have to say to me
this violent fashion of driving agra nds onto tenderness was productive only of silence on the part of marius

book ninth
whither are the ygo in g
chapter i jean valjean that same day towards four o'clock in the afternoon jean valjean was sitting alone on the backside of one of the most solitary slopes in the champ de mar s
either from prudence or from a desire to meditate or simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the existence of everyone he now rarely went out with cosette
he had on his work man 's waistcoat and trousers of grayline nand his long visor edc apco ncea led his countenance
he was calm and happy now beside cosette that which had for a time alarmed and trouble dhi mha dbe end is sip at edb utf or the last week or two anxieties of another nature had come up
one day while walking on the boulevard he had caught sight of the nardi erth an kst oh is disguise the nardi erh a dno trec ognized him but since that day jean valjean had seen him repeatedly and he was now certain that the nardi erw as prowling about inthe irn eigh borhood
this had been sufficient to make him come to a decision
moreover paris was not tranquil political troubles presented this inconvenient feature for anyone who had anything to conceal in his life that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious and that while seeking to ferret out aman like pepino rmo re ythe ym ight very readily discover a man like jean valjean
jean valjean had made up his mind to quit paris and even france and go over to england
he had warned cosette
he wished to set out before the end of the week
he had seated himself on the slope in the champ de mar stu rning overall sort soft hough tsin his mind the nardi erth epo lice the journey and the difficulty of procuring a passport
he was troubled from all the sep oint so fv ie w
last of all ani nex plicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention and from which he had not yet recovered had added to his state of alarm
onthe morning of that very day when he alone ofthe household was stirring while strolling in the garden before cosette 's shutters were open he had suddenly perceived on the wall thefollowing line engraved probably with an ai lru edel ave rre rie
this was perfectly fresh the grooves in the ancient black mortar were white at uf to fn et tle sat the foot of the wall was powdered with the fine fresh plaster
this had probably been written on the preceding night
what was this
as i gna lfor other s
awar ning for himself
in any case it was evident that the garden had been violated and that strangers had made the ir way into it
here called the odd incidents which had already a la rmed the household
his mind was now filling in this can vas
he took good care not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall for fear of alarming her
in the midst of his preoccupation she perceived from a shadow cast by the sun that someone had halted on the crest of the slope immediately behind him
he was on the point of turning round when a paper folded in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head
he took the paper unfolded it and read the sew or dsw ritt en in large characters with a pencil move away from your house
jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet there was no one on the slope he gazed all around him and perceived acre at ure larger than a child not solar geas aman clad in agra yb louse and trousers of dust colored cotton velvet who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the moat of the champ de mar s
jean valjean returned home at once in avery thoughtful mood
chapter ii marius marius had left m
gillen or mandi ndes pair
he had entered the house with very little hope and quitted it with immense despair
however and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this the office rthe lancer the ninny cousin the odu le had left not race in his mind
not the slightest
the dramatic poet might apparently expect some complications from this revelation made point blank bythe grandfather to the grandson
but what the drama would gain the re by truth would lose
marius was a tan age when one believes nothing in the line of evil later on comes the age when one believes everything
suspicion sare nothing else than wrinkles
early youth has no neo fthe m
that which overwhelmed othello glides innocuous over candid e
suspect cosette
the rear eho sts of crimes which marius could soon erh avec ommitted
he began to wander about the streets there source of those who suffer
he thought of nothing so far as he could afterwards remember
at two o'clock in the morning here turned to cour fey rac 's quarters and flung himself with out undressing on his mattress
the sun was shining brightly when he sank into that frightful lead en slumber which permits ideas to go and come in the brain
when he awoke he saw cour fey race nj olr as feu illya ndc omb efe rre standing in the room with the ir hats on and all ready to go out
cour fey racs aid to him are you coming to general lamarque 's funeral
it seemed to him that cour fey rac was speaking chinese
he went out sometime after the m
he put in his pocket the pistols which javert had given him at the time of the adventure on the doff ebruary and which had remained in his hands
the sep is to lsw eres till loaded
it would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he took the mwi th him
all day long he prowled about without knowing where he was going it rained a tti meshed id not perceive it for his dinner he purchased a penny roll at a baker 's put it in his pocket and for got it
it appears that he took a bath in the seine without being aware of it
the rear emo ments when a man has a furnace with in his skull
marius was passing through one of those moments
he nolonger hope dfor anything this step he had taken since the preceding evening
he waited for night with feverish impatience he had but one idea clearly before his mind this was that at nine o'clock he should see cosette
this last happiness now constitute dhis whole future after that gloom
at intervals as he roamed through the most deserted boulevard sits eem edt ohim that he heard strange noises in paris
he thrust his head out of his rever yand said isthe ref ight in gon hand
at night fall at nine o'clock precisely as he had promised cosette he was in the rue plume t
when he approached the grating he forgot everything
it was for tye ight hours since he had seen cosette he was about to be hold her once more every other thought was effaced and he felt only apr of ound and unheard of joy
those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property that at the moment when the yare passing the yf ill the heart completely
marius displaced the bar and rushed headlong into the garden
cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him
he traverse dthe thicket and approached the recess near the flight of steps she is waiting for me there said he
cosette was not there
her aise dhis eyes and saw that the shutter soft he house were closed
he made the tour of the garden the garden was deserted
the nhe returned to the house and rendered senseless by love intoxicated terrified exasperated with grief and uneasiness like a master who returns home at an evil hour he tapped on the shutter s
he knocked and knocked again at the risk of seeing the window open and her father 's gloomy face make it sapp ear an cea nd demand what do you want
this was nothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of
when he had rapped heli fte dup his voice and called cosette
cosette
he cried cosette
here peated imperiously
the rewa snore ply
all was over
noone in the garden noone in the house
marius fixed his despair in gey eso nth at dismal house which was a sbl ack and as silent as a tomb and farm or eem pty
he gazed at the stones eaton which he had passed soma ny adorable hours with cosette
the nhes eat ed himself on the flight of steps his heart filled with sweetness and resolution he blessed his love in the depths of his thought and he said to himself that since cosette was gone all that the rewa sle ft for him was to die
all at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street and which was calling to him through the trees mr
marius
he started to his feet
hey
said he
mr
marius are you there
yes
mr
marius went on the voice your friends are waiting for you atthe barricade of the rue de la chan vre rie
this voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him
it resembled the hoarse rough voice of epon in e
marius hastened to the gate thrust aside the movable bar passed his head through the aperture and saw someone who appeared to him to be a young man disappearing at a run into the gloom

the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated when cour fey rac again beheld on the barricade the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius

marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said iwill go
mad with grief nolonger conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain incapable of accepting anything thenceforth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to make a speedy end of all
he set out at rapid pace
he found himself most opportune lya rmed as he had javert 's pistols with him
the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had vanished from his sight in the street
marius who had emerged from the rue plume tb ythe boulevard traverse dthe esplanade and the bridge of the invalid est he champs elysees the place louis xv
and reached the rue de rivoli
the shops were open the re the gas was burning under the arcade sw omen were making the irp urchase sin the stalls people were eating ice sin the cafe la it era ndn ibb ling small cake sat the english pastry cook 's shop
only a few posting chaises were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes and the hotel meurice

marius followed the rue saint honore
in proportion as he left the palais royal behind him there were fewer light edwin do wst he shops were fast shut noone was chatting on the threshold sthe street grew so mbr eand at the same time the crowd increased in density
for the passersby now amounted to a crowd
noone could be seen to speak in this throng and yet there arose from it adul lde epm urm ur
near the fountain of the arbres ect here were assemblages motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water
atthe entrance to the rue de spro uva ires the crowd nolonger walked
it for me dares is ting massive solid compact almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones
the re were hardly any black coat so rro und hat snow but smock frocks blouses caps and bristling and cadaver ous heads
this multitude undulated confused lyin the nocturnal gloom
it sw his per ings had the hoarse accent of a vibration

only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance

the recirculation ceased
the re the rabble ended and the army began
marius will ed with the will of a man who hopes no more
he had been summoned he must go
he found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops he shunned the patrol she avoided the sentinel s
he made a circuit reached the rue de beth is yand directed his course towards the hall es
atthe corner of the rue de sbo urd on naist here were nolonger any lanterns
after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of the troops he found himself in something startling
the rewa sno longer a passerby nolonger as old ie rno longer alight the rewa sno one solitude silence night iknow not what chill which seized hold upon one
entering a street was like entering a cellar

it was an overturned wagon his foot recognized pools of water gullies and paving stones scattered and piled up
aba rri cade had been begun the rea nda band on ed
he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier
he walked very near the street posts and guided himself along the walls of the house s
alittle beyond the barricade its eem edt ohim that he could make out something white infront of him
he approached it took on a form
it was two whitehorse sthe horses of the omnibus harnessed by boss uet in the morning who had been straying at random all day from street to street and had finally halted the re with the weary patience of brute sw honom or eun derstand the actions of men than man understand sthe actions of providence
marius left the horses behind him
as he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the rue du contrat social ashot coming noone know sw hence and traversing the darkness at random whistle dc lose by him and the bullet pierced abra sss having dish suspended above his head over a hairdresser 's shop
this pierced shaving dish was still to be seen in inthe rue du contrat social atthe corner of the pillars of the market

all that old quarter of the hall es which is like a city within a city through which run the rue ssa in tde nisan dsa in tma rtin where a thousand lanes cross and of which the insurgents had made the irre doubt and the irs trong hold would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris
the re the glance fell into an abyss
thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased
the invisible police ofthe insurrection were on the watch everywhere and maintained order that is to say night
the necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small number sin avast obscurity to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains
at dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot
the light was extinguished sometimes the inhabitant was killed
hence nothing was stirring
the rewa snot hing but fright mourning stupor in the house sand in the streets as orto fsa cred horror
note vent he long rows of windows and stores the indentation soft he chimneys and the roof sand the vague reflections which are cast back bythe we tan dmu dd ypa vem ents were visible

the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above which inmotion less and melancholy outlines rose the tower of saint jacques the church of saint merry and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantom s
all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarter sw here the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where a few street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the dull rumble of artillery and the swarming of silent battalion sw hose ranks were swelling from minute to minute afor mid able girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection
the invested quarter was nolonger anything more than a monstrous cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we have just seen any street which one might come to offer edn othing but darkness
awi ldd ark ness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks in to which it was alarming to penetrate and inwhich it was terrible to remain where those who entered shivered before those who mthe yaw aite dwh ere those who waited shuddered before those who were coming
invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the streets nares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night
all was over
no more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns n o further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death
where
how
when
noone knew but it was certain and inevitable
in this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the bourgeois and the uprising groping the ir way we re about to come into contact
the necessity was the same for both
the only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge the nce killed or conquerors
as it uations oex treme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution and the most daring with terror
moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were equal
for the one party to advance meant death and noone dreamed of retreating for the other to remain meant death and noone dreamed of flight
it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that triumph should rest either here or the retha tthe insurrection should prove itself are volution or ask irm is h
the government understood this aswell as the parties them osti nsi gni fica nt bourgeois felt it

here only one sound was audible as ound as heartrending as the death rattle as menacing as a male diction the toc sino fsa in tme rr y
nothing could be more blood curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell wailing amid the shadows
as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into a cco rd with what men were about to do

it had drawn him to the march eaux poire esa nd he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue de spre che urs
he entered it
the insurgents 's ent in el who was guarding the other end didnot see him

alittle beyond the angle of the lane and the rue de la chan vre rie which cast abroad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed he perceived some light on the pavement abit of the wines hop and beyond a flickering lamp with in a sort of shapeless wall and men crouching down with guns on the irk nees
all this was ten fathoms distant from him
it was the interior of the barricade
the house sw hich bordered the lane on the right concealed the rest of the wines hop the large barricade and the flag from him
marius had but as tep more to take
the nth eun happy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms and fell to thinking about his father
he thought of that he roi cco lone lpo nt mercy who had been so proud as old ie rwho had guarded the frontier of france under the republican dha dto uche dthe frontier of asia under napoleon who had beheld genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victorious battlefield so feu rope drops of that same blood which he marius had in his veins who had grown gray before his time indiscipline and command who had lived with his sword belt buckle dhis epaulets falling on his breast hiscock ade blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks in camp in the bivouac in ambulances and who atthe expiration of twenty years had returned from the great war swith as carre dc he eka smiling countenance tranquil admirable pure as a child having done everything for france and nothing against her
he said to himself that his day had also come now that his hour had struck that following his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast to bayonets to shed his blood to see kthe enemy to see kde at hth at hew as about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war
he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he was about to fall
the nhes hud dered
he thought of his father 's sword which his grandfather had sold to as econ dhan dde alera nd which he had so mournfully regretted
he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword haddon ewell to escape from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war of the gutters the war of the pavement sfu silla de st hr ough cellar windows blows given and receive dint here ari twas because coming from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la chan vre rie it was because after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son
he told him self that if that sword were there if after taking possession of it at his father 's pillow he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between french men in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out aflame before his eyes like the sword of the angel
he told him self that it was fortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father 's glory and that it was far better that the colonel 's sword should be sold at auction sold to the old clothes man thrown among the old junk than that it should today wound the side of his country
and the nhe fell to weeping bitterly
this was horrible
but what was he todo
live without cosette he could not
since she was gone he must needs die
had he not given her his word of honor that he would die
she had gone knowing that this mean tth at it pleased her that marius should die
and the nit was clear that she nolonger love dhi msi nces he had departed thus without warning without a word without a letter although she knew his address
what was the good of living and why should he live now
and the nw hat
should here treat after going sofa r
should he flee from danger after having approach edit
should he slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade
slip away all in a trembl esa ying after all ihave had enough of it as it is
ihave seen it that suffices this is civil war and is hall take my leave
should he abandon his friends who were expecting him
who were in need of him possibly
who were amer eha ndf ula gains tana rm y
should he be untrue at once to his love to country to his word
should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism
but this was impossible and if the phantom of his father was the rein the gloom and beheld him retreating he would be at him on the loins with the flat of his sword and shout to him march on you pol troon
thus apr ey to the conflicting movements of his thoughts he dropped his head
all at once he raised it
as orto fsp lend id rectification had just been effected in his mind
the reis awid ening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to be near death
the vision of the action in to which he felt that he was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him no more aslam ent able but as super b

and the nif we look at things from astill more lofty point of view why do we speak of civil war

this whirlwind which was within him produced on him the effect of being outside of him and of bearing him away

he was obliged to make a mental effort to recall the fact that all that surrounded him was real
marius had already seen to om uch of life not to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible and that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen
he had looked on a this own drama as a piece which one does not understand
in the mists which envelope dhis thoughts he did not recognize javert who bound to his post had not so much as moved his head during the whole of the attack on the barricade and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge

chapter vi the agony of death after the agony of life apec uli arity of this species of war is that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position either because they fear ambushes or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous street s
the insurgents ' whole attention had been directed therefore to the grand barricade which was evidently the spot always menace dan dthe re the struggle would infallibly recommence
but marius thought of the little barricade and went thither
it was deserted and guarded only by the fire pot which trembl ed between the paving stones
moreover the monde to ural ley and the branches of the rue de la petite tru and erie and the rue du cygne were profoundly calm

he bent down and saw in the darkness afor mwh ich was dragging its elf towards him
it was crawling along the pavement
it was this that had spoken to him
the fire pot allowed him to distinguish a blouse to rnt rousers of coarse velvet barefeet and something which resembled a pool of blood
marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted towards him and which was saying to him you do not recognize me
no

jean valjean had infact returned home and had said to cosette we set out this evening and we got other ued el ' homme arm ewi tht ous saint

cosette utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow had hastily penned a couple of lines to marius
but how was she toget the letter to the post
she never went out alone and toussaint surprised at such a commission would certainly show the letter to m

while he was discussing this modest dinner he had twice or thrice notice dina confused way to us saint 's stammering words as she said to him monsieur the reiss ome thing going on the yare fighting in paris

with this calm cosette his sole anxiety recurred to his thoughts

in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge jean valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for sometime past
this very fact that he had seen many shadows made him begin to perceive alittle azure
to have quitted the rue plume twit hout complications or incidents was one good step already accomplished
perhaps it would be wise to goabroad if only for a few months and to set out for london
well they would go
what difference did it make to him whether he was in france or in england provided he had cosette beside him
cosette was his nation
cosette suffice dfor his happiness the idea that he perhaps did not suffice for cosette 's happiness that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness did not even present itself to his mind

june th
jean valjean halted perfectly haggard
cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting book on the sideboard infront of the mirror and utterly absorbed in her agony of grief had forgotten it and left it there without even observing that she had left it wide open and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she had penned and which she had given in charge of the young work man in the rue plume t
the writing had been printed off on the blotter
the mirror reflected the writing
the result was what is called in geometry the symmetrical images otha tthe writing reverse dont he blotter was right edin the mirror and presented its natural appearance and jean valjean had beneath his eyes the letter written by cosette to marius on the preceding evening
it was simple and with erin g
jean valjean stepped up to the mirror
here adt he four lines again but he did not believe the m
the ypr odu ced on him the effect of appearing in a flash of lightning
it was a hallucination it was impossible
it was not so
little by little his perceptions became more precise he looked at cosette 's blotting book and the consciousness of the reality returned to him
he caught up the blotter and said it comes from the re
he feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter the reversal of the letters converted into an odd scrawl and he saw no sense in it
the nhes aid to himself but this signifies nothing there is not hing written here
and he drew along breath with inexpressible relief
who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instant s
the soul does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions
hehe ldt he blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe
all at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again and again he beheld the vision
the re were the four lines outlined within exo rable clearness
this time it was no mirage
the recurrence of avision is a reality it was palpable it was the writing restored in the mirror
he understood
jean valjean tottered dropped the blotter and fell into the old armchair beside the buffet with drooping head and glass yey esi nutter bewilderment
he told him self that it was plain that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever and that cosette had written that to someone
the nhe heard his soul which had become terrible once more give vent to a dull roar in the gloom
try the nth eef fect of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage
strange and sad to say at that very moment marius had not yet received cosette 's letter chance had treacherously carried it to jean valjean before delivering it to marius
upto that day jean valjean had not been vanquished by trial
he had been subjected to fearful proof sno violence of bad fortune had been spared him the ferocity of fate armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn had taken him for her prey and had raged against him
he had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary he had sacrificed his inviolability as a reformed man had yielded up his liberty risk ed his head lost everything suffered everything and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr
his conscience in ured to every assault of destiny might have appeared to be forever impregnable
well anyone who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment
it was because of all the torture sw hich he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him this was the most terrible
never had such pincers seized him hitherto
he felt the mysterious stirring of all his late nts en sibilities
he felt the plucking at the strange chord
alas
the supreme trial let us say rather the only trial is the loss of the beloved being
poor old jean valjean certainly did not love cosette otherwise than a safat her but we have already remarked above that into this paternity the widowhood of his life had introduced all the shades of love helo ved cosette as his daughter and he loved her as his mother and he loved her as his sister and as he had never had either a woman to love or a wife as nature is a credit or who accepts no protest that sentiment also the most impossible to lose was mingled with the rest vague ignorant pure with the purity of blindness unconscious celestial angelic divine less like a sentiment than like an instinct less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real attraction and love properly speaking was in his immense tenderness for cosette like the thread of gold in the mountain concealed and virgin
let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated
nomar riage was possible between the mno tev ent hat of souls and yet it is certain that the ird est in ies were wedded
with the exception of cosette that is to say with the exception of a childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anything of that which may be loved
the passion sand love sw hich succeed eachother had not produce dinh imt hoses ucce ssi veg re engr owt hst end erg re enor darkgreen which can be seen in foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty

he examined this revelation athwart the exaggeration so fre very with an apparent and terrifying calmness for it is a fearful thing when a man 's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue

the unprecedented and heartrending thing about it was that he had fallen without perceiving it

his instinct did not hesitate
he put together certain circumstances certain dates certain blushes and certain pallor son cosette 's part and he said to himself itis he
the divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses its aim
he struck marius with his first conjecture
he did not know the name but he found the man instantly

while he was meditating toussaint entered
jean valjean rose and asked her in what quarter is it
do you know
toussaint was struck dumb and could only answer him what is it sir
jean valjean began again did you not tell me that just now that the reis fighting going on

it was no doubt under the impulse of a movement of this sort and of which he was hardly conscious that jean valjean five minutes later found himself in the street
bareheaded he sat upon the stone post a tthe door of his house
he seemed to be listening

what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation

he probably would not have been able to tell him self
the street was deserted

each one for himself in time so fpe ril
the lamplighter came as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door of no

jean valjean would not have appeared like a living man to anyone who had examined him in that shadow
he sat there on the post of his door motionless as a form of ice

the alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible
in the midst of all the sec on vul sions of the bell mingled with the revolt the clock of saint paul struck eleven gravely and without has tef or the toc sin is man the hour is god

still at about that moment abr us que report burst forth in the direction of the hall esas econ dye t more violent followed it was probably that attack on the barricade in the rue de la chan vre rie which we have just seen repulsed by marius
at this double discharge whose fury seemed augmented by the stupor of the night jean valjean started her oset urn in gto wards the quarter when cet he noise proceeded the nhe fell back upon the post again folded his arms and his head slowly san kon his bosom again
here sumed his gloomy dialogue with himself
all at once he raised his eyes someone was walking in the street hehe ards teps near him
he looked and bythe light of the lantern sin the direction of the street which ran into the rue aux archives he perceived a young livid and beaming face
gav roche had just arrived in the rue l' homme arm e
gav roche was staring into the air apparently in search of something
he saw jean valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him

jean valjean who ani nsta ntp revio us lyin his then state of mind would not have spoken to or even answered anyone felt irresistibly impelled to accost that child

and he flung the stone at the lantern whose broken glass fell with such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind the irc urt ainsi nthe opposite house cried the reis ' ninety three ' come again
the lantern oscillated violently and went out

he plunged back into the gloom as though he made a hole in it with the rigid rapidity of a project ile the alley of l' homme arm ebe came silent and solitary once more in a twinkling that strange child who had about him something of the shadow and ofthe dream had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black house sand was lost the reli kes moke in the dark and one might have thought that he had dissipated and vanished had the reno tta ken place a few minutes after his disappearance as tart ling shiver of glass and had not the magnificent crash of alan tern rattling down on the pavement once more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois

he groped his way up the stairs as please dwi tht he darkness as an owl who grips his prey opened and shut his door softly listened to see whether he could hear any noise made sure that to all appearances cosette and toussaint were asleep and plunged three or four matches in to the bottle of the fuma delight erbe for ehec ould evoke a spark so great lyd id his hand trembl e

he uttered a frightful cryo fin ward joy
so it was all over
the catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope
the being who obstructed his destiny was disappearing
that man had taken himself off of his own accord free ly willingly
this man was going to his death and he jean valjean had had no hand in the matter and it was through no fault of his
perhaps even he is already dead
here his fever entered into calculations
no heis not dead yet
the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning after the two discharge sth at were heard between eleven o'clock and midnight nothing more hasta ken place the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost he is caught in the gearing
jean valjean felt himself delivered
so he was about to find himself alone with cosette once more
the rivalry would cease the future was beginning again
he had but to keep this note in his pocket
cosette would never know what had become of that man
all that the re requires to be done is to let things take the irow nco urs e
this man can not escape
if he is not already dead itis certain that he is about to die
what good fortune
having said all this to himself he became gloomy
the nhe went downstairs and woke up the porter
about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of an ational guard and with his arms
the porter had easily found in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment
he had a loaded gun and acar tridge box filled with cartridges
he strode of fin the direction of the market s

the sentinel station ed by the insurgents in the rue monde to ur had no occasion to give the alarm for a single national guard sma nand he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the streets ayin gto himself probably it is a reinforcement in any case it is a prisoner
the moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and his post of observation
atthe moment when jean valjean entered the redoubt noone had noticed him all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms
jean valjean also had seen and heard and he had silently removed his coat and flung it on the pile with the rest

from apolitical point of view the reis but as in gle principle the sovereignty of man over himself
this sovereignty of myself over myself is called liberty
where two or three of the ses over eign ties are combined the state begins
but in that association there is no abdication
each sovereignty concedes acer tain quantity of itself for the purpose of forming the common right
this quantity is the same for all of us
this identity of concession which each makes to all is called equality
common right is not hinge lse than the protection of all beaming on the right of each
this protection of all over each is called fraternity
the point of intersection of all the seas semble dso vere ign ties is called society
this intersection being a junction this point is a knot
hence what is called the social bond
some say social contract which is the same thing the word contract being etymologically for me dwi tht heide a of a bond
let us come to an understanding about equality for if liberty is the summit equality is the base
equality citizens is not wholly as urfa cev eget ation as ociety of great blades of grass and tiny oaks aprox imit yof jealousies which render eachother null and void legally speaking it is all aptitude spo sses sedo fthe same opportunity political ly it is all votes possessed of the same weight religious ly it is all conscience spo sses sedo fthe same right

only he thought of cosette with a pang at his heart
however m

as far as marius was concerned this attitude of m
fau che le vent was comforting and if such a word can be used for such impressions we should say that it pleased him
he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatic alma nw how asin his eyes both equivocal and imposing

this defect of the tension of the curve of the project ile in the rifle dca nno no fthe sixteenth century arose from the smallness of the charges mall charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic necessities such for instance as the preservation of the gun carriage

cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris
she had not been there on the preceding evening and she had already retired to her chamber when toussaint had said it appears that the reis a row
cosette had slept on lya few hours but sound ly
she had had sweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that he rli ttl ebe dwa sve ry white
someone who was marius had appeared to her in the light
she awoke with the sun in here yes which at first produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream
her first thought one merging from this dream was a smiling on e
cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured
like jean valjean she had a few hours previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness
she began to cherish hope with all her might without knowing why
the nsh efe ltap an gather heart
it was three days since she had seen marius
but she said to herself that he must have received her letter that he knew where she was an dth at hew assoc lever that he would find means of reaching her
and that certainly today and perhaps that very morning
it was broad daylight but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very early but that she must rise nevertheless inorder to receive marius
she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently that was sufficient and that marius would come
no objection was valid
all this was certain
it was monstrous enough already to have suffered for three days
marius absent three days this was horrible on the part of the good god
now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with
marius was about to arrive and he would bring good news
you this made thus it quickly dries its eyes it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it
you this the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown quantity which is itself
it is natural to it to be happy
it seems as though it sres pirat ion were made of hope
moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what explanation of it heh a dgi ven her

cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory
she told her self that it was very naughty and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius
she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body her prayers and her toilet

cosette dressed herself very hastily combed and dressed her hair which was avery simple matter in those days when women did not swell out the irc url sand bands with cushions and puffs and did not put crinoline in the irlo cks
the nsh eop ened the window and cast here yes around her in every direction hoping to descr yso me bit of the street an angle of the house an edge of pavement so that she might be able to watch for marius the re
but no view of the outside was to be had
the backcourt was surrounded by tolerably high walls and the outlook was only on several garden s
cosette pronounced the sega rd en shi de ous for the first time in her life she found flowers ugly
the smallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better
she decided to gaze at the sky as though she thought that marius might come from that quarter
all at once she burst into tears
not that this was fickleness of soul but hopes cut in twain by dejection that was her case
she had a confused consciousness of something horrible
thoughts were rife in the air infact
she told her self that she was not sure of anything that to withdraw herself from sight was to be lost and the idea that marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her nolonger charming but mournful

the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain and rather bewildered by all this light the yt ried to hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of even impersonal magnificence and the yke ptb ehi ndt he swans ' hutch

this father and son came from one of the seh ouse sno doubt
the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and hid themselves alittle more thoroughly
he was a bourgeois
the same person perhaps who mma riu shado neda yhe ard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling his son to avoid excess es
he had an affable and haughty air and amout hwh ich was always smiling since it did not shut
this mechanical smile produced by too much jawa ndt ool it tle skins how sthe teeth rather than the soul
the child with his brioche which he had bitten in to but had not finished eating seemed satiated
the child was dressed as an ational guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence
father and son halted near the fountain where two swans were sporting
this bourgeois appeared to cherish as pecial admiration for the swans

for the moment the swans were swimming which is the irp rin cipal talent and the yw eres up erb
if the two poor little being shad listened and if the yha dbe en of an age to understand the ym ight have gathered the words of this graveman

here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the hall esb urs to ut with fresh for ceo fbe llan dup roar

and after a pause head de dana rch yi sent erin gth is garden
in the meanwhile his son took a bit eof his brioche spit it out and suddenly burst out crying
what are you crying about
demanded his father
iam not hungry anymore said the child
the father 's smile became more accentuated
one does not need to be hungry in order to eat a cake
my cake tires me
it is stale
don't you want anymore of it
no
the father pointed to the swans

the child hesitate d

the father went on beh umane
you must have compassion on animals
and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin
the cake fell very near the edge
the swans were faraway in the centre of the basin and busy with some pre y
the yha dse en neither the bourgeois north ebri oche
the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraph ica gita tion which finally attracted the attention of the swans
the yper ceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as the yare and slowly directed the irc our set owa rd the brioche with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures

the one which was blowing a tth at moment brought clearly defined drumbeats clamor splat oon firing and the dismal replies ofthe to csi nand the cannon
this coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun
the swans had not yet reached the brioche

he grasped his son 's hand again
the nhe continued from the tuileries to the luxembourg the reis but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage that is not far
shots will soon rain down
he glanced at the cloud
perhaps it is rain itself that is about to show erd own the sky is joining in the younger branch is condemned

the father replied that would be imprudent
and he led his little bourgeois away
the son regretting the swans turned his head back to ward the basin until acorn ero fthe quin cun xes concealed it from him
in the meanwhile the two little waifs had approached the brioche at the same time as the swans
it was floating on the water

father and son entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand flight of steps near the clump of trees on the side of the rue madame

this recollection was misty and trouble dhow ever like all his ideas
it was not an affirmation that he made but aquest ion which he put to himself is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert

everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment at hous and mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the march the firing by squads and the cannon ades crossing each other inthe labyrinth of paris the smoke so fba ttl emo unti nga llg il de dabo vet her oof sind escriba blean dva gue lyte rri ble cries lightning so fme nace everywhere the toc sino fsa in tme rr yw hich now had the accents of a sob the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the house s
for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue de la chan vre rie had become two walls ferocious walls doors closed windows closed shutters closed
in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour was come when the people wished to put an end to as it uation which had lasted to olo ng with a charter granted or with a legal country when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere when the city consent edt othe tearing up of the pavement sw henin sur rection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering its password in its earth ent he inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt soto speak was the auxiliary of the combatant and the house frater nized with the improvised fortress which rested on it
when the situation was not ripe when the insurrection was not decided lya dmi tted when the masses disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuge swer en ailed up and the street turned into a defile to help the army to take the barricade

noone and everyone
the incomplete times in which we live
it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and from minerva turns to pallas
the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt know sw hat awaits it ital most always comes to oso on
the nit becomes resigned and stoically accept scat astro phe in lieu of triumph
it serves those who deny it without complaint even excusing the man dev end is culpa test heman dits magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment
it is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude
is this ingratitude however
yes from the point of view of the human race
no fromthe point of view of the individual
progress is man 's mode of existence
the general life of the human race is called progress the collective stride of the human race is called progress
progress advance sit makes the great human and terrestrial journey towards the celestial and the divine it has its halting place sw here it rallies the laggard troop it has its stations where it meditate sin the presence of some splendid can aans ud den ly unveiled on its horizon it has its nights when it sleeps and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the human soul and that he gropes in darkness without being able to awaken that slumbering progress
god is dead perhaps said gerard de nerval one day to the writer of the selin escon founding progress with god and taking the interruption of movement for the death of being
he who despair sis in the wrong
progress in fall ibl yaw a kes and in short we may say that it march eso neven when it is asleep for it has increased in size
when we behold it erect once more we find it taller
to be always peaceful does not depend on progress anymore than it does onthe stream erect no barriers cast in no boulder so bst acle sma kew at erf roth and humanity boil
hence arise trouble sbu taft erth eset roubles were cogni zet he fact that ground has been gained
until order which is not hinge lse than universal peace has been established until harmony and unity reign progress will have revolution sasi tsh alt in gpl aces
what the nis progress
wehave just enunciated it the permanent life of the people s
now it sometimes happens that the moment aryl if eof individuals offers resistance to the eternal life of the human race
let us admit without bitterness that the individual has his distinct interests and can without forfeiture stipulate for his interest and defend it the present has its pardonable dose of egotism momentary life has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to the future
the generation which is passing in its turnover the earth is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generation sits equal after all who will have the irt urn later on

hence at certain hours apr of ound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race
utopia moreover we must admit quits its radiant sphere when it makes war
it the truth of tomorrow borrow sits mode of procedure battle from the lie of yesterday
it the future behaves like the past
it pure idea becomes a deed of violence
it complicates its heroism with a violence for which it is just that it should be held to answer avi olen ceo foc casio nand expedient contrary to principle and for which it is fatally punished

it strikes with the sword
now no sword is simple
every blade has two edges he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other
having made this reservation and made it with all severity it is impossible for us not to admire whether the ysu ccee do rno tth oset he glorious combatants of the future the confessor so fut opi a
even when the ym is carry the yare worthy of veneration and it is perhaps in failure that the ypos sess the most majesty
victory when it is in accord with progress merits the applause of the people but a heroic defeat merits their tender compassion
the one is magnificent the other sublime
for our own part we prefer martyrdom to success
john brown is greater than washington and pisa can eis greater than garibaldi
it certainly is necessary that someone should take the part of the vanquished
we are unjust to ward sthe segre at me nw hoa tte mpt the future when the yf a il

the ym ight reply that is because our barricade is made of good intentions
the best thing assuredly is the pacific solution
in short let us agree that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is a good will which renders society uneasy
but it depends on society to save itself it is to its own good will that we make our appeal
nov iol entre med yi sne cess ary

it is to this that we invite it
however that maybe even when fallen above all when fallen the semen who ate very point of the universe with the ire yes fixed on france are striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal are august they give the irl if eaf re eof fering to progress they accomplish the will of providence they perform a religious act

the french revolution is an act of god
moreover there are and it is proper to add this distinction to the distinction sal ready pointed out in another chapter there are accepted revolution sre volution sw hich are called revolution sthe rear ere fused revolution sw hich are called riots
an insurrection which breaks out is an idea which is passing it sexam ination before the people
if the people lets fall abla ckb all the idea is dried fruit the insurrection is a mere skirmish
waging war at every summons and everytime that utopia desires it is not the thing for the people s
nations have not always and at every hour the temperament of heroes and martyrs
the yare positive
apriori insurrection is repugnant to the mint he first place because it often results in a catastrophe in the second place because it always has an abstraction as it spo into fdep art ure
because and this is an ob let hing it is always forth eide alan dfor the ideal alone that those who sacrifice themselves do thus sacrifice themselves
an insurrection is an enthusiasm
enthusiasm may wax wroth hence the appeal to arms
but every insurrection which aims at a government or are gime aims higher
thus for instance and we insist upon it what the chief soft heins urr ection of an din particular the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chan vre rie were combating was not precisely louis philippe
the majority of the mwh ental king free lyd id justice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution noone hated him
but the yatta cked the younger branch of the divine right in louis philippe as the yha datta cked its elder branch in charles x
and that which the yw is he dto overturn in overturning royalty infra nce was a swe have explained the usurpation of man over man and of privilege over right in the entire universe
paris without a king has a sres ult the world without despots
this is the manner in which the yr eason ed
the ira im was distant no doubt vague perhaps an dit retreated in the face of the ire ffor tsb uti twas great
thus it is
and we sacrifice ourselves for the sevis ions which are almost always illusions for the sacrifice dbu till us ions with which after all the whole of human certain ty is mingled
we throw ourselves into the set rag icaf fair sand become intoxicated with that which we are about to do
who knows
we may succeed
we are few in number wehave a whole army array eda gains tus but we are defending right then atural law the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible justice and truth and incase of need wed ie like the three hundred spartans
we do not think of don quixote but of leonidas
and we march straight before us and once pledged wed on otdr a wba cka nd we rush onwards with head held low cherishing as our hope an unprecedented victory revolution completed progress set free again the aggrandizement of the human race universal deliverance and in the event of the worst thermopylae
the sepa ssa ges of arms for the sake of progress of tens uffe rsh ip wreck and we have just explained why
the crowd is restive in the presence of the impulse so fpa ladin s
heavy masses them ulti tudes which are fragile because of the irv ery weight fear adventures and the reis at ouch of adventure in the ideal
moreover and we must not forget this interest sw hich are not very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way
sometimes the stomach paralyzes the heart
the grandeur and beauty of france lies in this that she takes less from the stomach than other nations she more easily knots the rope about her loins
she is the first awake the last asleep
she march esf or wards
she is a seeker
this arises from the fact that she is an artist
the ideal is not hing but the culminating point of logic the same as the beautiful is not hing but the summit of the true
artist icp eople sare also consistent people s
to love beauty is to see the light
that is why the torch of europe that is to say of civilization was first born eby greece who passed it onto italy who handed it onto france
divine illuminating nations of scouts

it is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of its progress
the amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of imagination
only a civil izing people should remain a man ly people
corinth yes sybaris no
whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a bastard
he must be neither a dilettante nora virtuoso but he must be artistic
in the matter of civilization he must not refine but he must sublime
onthis condition one gives to the human race the pattern of the ideal
the modern idea lhas its type in art and its means is science
it is through science that it will realize that august vision of the poets the social ly beautiful
eden will be reconstructed by a b
atthe point which civilization has now reached the exact is an ece ssa rye lement of the splendid and the artistic sentiment is not only served but complete dby the scientific organ dreams must be calculated
art which is the conqueror should have for support science which is the walker the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance
the modern spirit is the genius of greece with the genius of india as it sve hicle alexander on the elephant
races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to guide civilization
genuflect ion before the idol or before money was tesa way the muscles which walk and the will which advances

babylon has no idea lca rth age has no idea l
athens and rome have an dke ept hr ough out all the nocturnal darkness of the centuries halos of civilization
france is in the same quality of race as greece and italy
she is athenian in the matter of beauty and roman in her great ness
moreover she is good
she gives herself
often erth an isthe case with other races is she inthe humor for self devotion and sacrifice
only this humor seizes upon her and again abandon she r
and the rein lies the great peril for those who run when she desires only to walk or who walk on when she desires to halt
france has her relapse sin to materialism and at certain instant sthe ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything which recalls french greatness and are ofthe dimensions of amiss our ior as out hca rolin a

one word more before returning to our subject the conflict
aba ttl eli ket he one which we are engaged in describing is not hinge lse than a convulsion towards the ideal
progress trammell edis sickly and is subject to the set rag ice pile psi es
with that malady of progress civil war wehave been obliged to come in contact in our passage
this is one of the fatal phases at once a ctan dent r ' act eof that drama whose pivot is a social condemnation and whose veritable title is progress

the bravery exhibited the rewa salmo st barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity which began by the sacrifice of self
this was the epoch when an ational guardsman fought like a zouave

the acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy

nevertheless the attacking column constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets drew inexorably nearer and now little by little step by step but surely the army closed in around the barricade as the vice grasp sthe winepress

he was still in the same posture with his breast be nto vert he table his head lying flat on his arms surrounded by glasses beer jugs and bottles

chapter xxiv prisoner marius was in fact apr iso ner
the hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of jean valjean
jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose himself in it
had it not been for him noone in that supreme phase of agony would have thought of the wounded
thanks to him everywhere present in the carnage like a provide nce those who fell were picked up transport edt othe taproom and care dfor
in the interval she reappeared on the barricade
but nothing which could resemble a blow an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands
hehe ldh is peace and lent succor
moreover he had received only a few scratches
the bullets would have no neo fhi m
if suicide formed part of what he had meditated on coming to this sepulchre to that spot he had not succeeded
but we do ubt whether he had thought of suicide an irreligious act
jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see marius the truth is that he never took his eyes from the latter
when a shot laid marius low jean valjean leaped forward with the agility of a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off
the whirlwind of the attack was a tth at moments ovi olen tly concentrated upon enjo lra sand upon the door of the wines hop that noone saw jean valjean sustaining the fainting marius in his arms traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the corinth ebuild in g
the reader will recall this angle which formed as orto fca peon the street ita fforde dsh elte rfr omt he bullets the grapes hot and all eyes and a few square feet of space

it was in this sort of fold in the interior trapezium of the barricade that epon in ehad breathed her last
the re jean valjean halted let marius slide to the ground place dhis back against the wall and cast his eyes about him
the situation was alarming
for an instant for two or three perhaps this bit of wall was a shelter but how was he toes cape from this massacre
here called the anguish which he had suffered in the rue polo ncea uei ght years before and in what manner he had contrived to make his escape it was difficult then today it was impossible
he had before him that deaf and implacable house six stories in height which appeared to be inhabited only by a deadman leaning out of his window heh adon his right the rather low barricade which shutoff the rue de la petite tru and erie top ass this obstacles eem edea syb ut beyond the crest of the barrier aline of bayonets was visible
the troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade
it was evident that to pass the barricade was to go inquest of the fire of the platoon and that any head which should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve as a target for sixty shots
on his left he had the field of battle
death lurked round the corner of that wall
what was to be done
only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament
and it was necessary to decide on the instant to devise some expedient to come to some decision
fighting was going on a few paces away fortunately all were raging around asin gle point the door of the wines hop but if it should occur to one soldier to one single soldier to turn the corner of the house or to attack him on the flank all was over
jean valjean gazed at the house facing him he gazed at the barricade at one side of him the nhe looked at the ground with the violence of the last extremity bewildered and as though he would have liked to pierce a hole there with his eyes
by dint of staring something vaguely striking in such an agony began to assume for man do ut line at his feet as though it had been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold
afew pace sdi stan the perceived at the base of the small barriers opi tiles sly guarded and watched on the exterior beneath a disordered mass of paving stones which partly concealed it an iron grating place dfl at and on a level with the soil
this grating made of stout transverse bars was about two feet square
the frame of paving stones which supported it had been torn up and it was a sit were unfastened
through the bars aview could be had of adar kaper tures ome thing like the flue of achim ney or the pipe of a cistern
jean valjean darted forward
his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
to thrust aside the stones to raise the grating to lift marius who was a sine rtas adea dbo dy upon his shoulders to descend with this burden on his loins and with the aid of his elbows and knees in to that sort of well fortunately not very deep to let the heavy trap upon which the loosened stones rolled down afresh fall into its place behind him to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the surface all this was executed like that which one does in dreams with the strength of agian tan dthe rapidity of an eagle this took only a few minutes
jean valjean found himself with marius who was still unconscious in a sort of long subterranean corridor
the re reigned profound peace absolute silence night
the impression which he had formerly experience dwh en falling from the wall into the convent recurred to him
only what he was carrying today was not cosette it was marius
he could barely hear the formidable tumult in the wines hop taken by assault like a vague murmur overhead

book third
mud but the soul chapter ithe sewer and its surprise sit was in the sewers of paris that jean valjean found himself
still another resemblance between paris and the sea
asin the ocean the diver may disappear there
the transition was an unheard of one
in the very heart of the city jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it heh adp assed from broad daylight to complete obscurity from midday to midnight from tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunder sto the stagnation of the tomb and by a vic is situ def armor etre men do use vent han that of the rue polo ncea ufr omt hemos text re me peril to the most absolute obscurity

the waste trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him
celestial goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery
adorable am busca de so fpr ovid ence
only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being oradea dcor pse
his first sensation was one of blindness
all of a sudden he could see nothing
it seemed to him to otha tino nein stan the had become deaf
he nolonger heard anything
the frantic storm of murder which had been let loose afew feet above his head didnot reach him thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said otherwise than faintly and indistinct lya nd like a rumbling in the depths
he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough
he extended one armand the nth eot her touched the walls on both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was wet
he cautiously put forward one foot fearing a hole asin ks omeg ulf hedis covered that the paving continued
agus to ffe tid ness informed him of the place in which he stood
after the lapse of a few minutes he was nolonger blind
alittle light fell through the manhole through which he had descended and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern
he began to distinguish something
the passage in which he had burrowed no other word can be tter express the situation was walled in behind him
it was one of those blind alleys which the special jargon terms branches
infront of him there was another wall awal lli ken ight
the light of the air hole died out tenor twelve pace sfr omt he point where jean valjean stood and barely cast a wan pallor on a few metres of the damp walls of the sewer
beyond the opaque ness was massive top enet rate thither seemed horrible an entrance into it appeared like an engulf men t
aman could however plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary so to do
has tewa seven requisite
it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the flagstones might also catch the eye of the soldier yand that everything hung up on this chance
the yal so might descend into that we llan dse archit
the rewa snot amin ute to be lost
he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is the real word for it placed him on his shoulders once more and set out
he plunged resolutely into the gloom
the truth is that the yw ere less safe than jean valjean fancied
perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting the mpe rchan ce
after the lightning charged whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasma sand traps after chaos the sewer
jean valjean had fallen from one circle of hell into another
when he had advanced fifty pace she was obliged to halt
apr obl emp resented it self
the passage terminated in another gut which he encountered across his path
the re two ways presented themselves
which should he take
ought he to turn to the left or to the right
how was he to find his bearings in that black labyrinth
this labyrinth to which we have already called the reader 's attention has a clue which is it ssl ope
to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river
this jean valjean instantly comprehended
he said to himself that he was probably in the sewer desha lles that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth on the seine between the ponta uch an gea ndt he pont neuf that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely people dspot in paris
perhaps he would come out on some manhole at the intersection of streets
amazement of the passersby at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at the irf eet
arrival of the police acal lto arms of the neighboring post of guards
thus the yw ould be seized before the yha dev eng oto ut
it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust toprovide nce for the outcome
he ascended the incline and turned to the right
when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an air hole disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again
nevertheless head vance das rapidly as possible
marius ' two arms were passed round his neck and the former 's feet dragged behind him
hehe ldb oth the sea rms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other
marius ' cheek to uche dhis and clung the re bleeding
he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making it sway under his clothes
but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life
the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not sonar row as the first
jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty
the rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely runoff and it created alittle torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water
thus he proceeded in the gloom
here semble dthe being soft henig htg roping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow
still little by little whether it was that the distant air holes emitted alittle wavering light in this opaque gloom or whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began on cem or et oga in a confused idea now ofthe wall which he touched now ofthe vault beneath which he was passing
the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there
it was not easy to direct his course
the line of the sewer re echoes soto speak the line of the streets which lie above it
the re were the nin paris two thousand two hundred street s
let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer
the system of sewers existing at that epoch place de ndt oen dwo uld have given a length of eleven league s
wehave said above that the actual network thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty league sinex tent
jean valjean began by committing a blunder
he thought that he was beneath the rue saint denis and it was a pity that it was not so
under the rue saint denis the reis an old stone sewer which dates from louis xiii
and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but as in glee lbo wont her ight on the elevation of the ancient cour des miracles and asin gleb ranch the saint martin sewer whose four arms describe across
but the gut of the petite tru and erie the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the corinth ewin eshop has never communicate dwi tht he sewer of the rue saint denis it ended at the montmartre sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled
the re opportunities of losing one self abound
the montmartre sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network
fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the market sw hose geometrical plan present sthe appearance of a multitude of parrots ' roosts piled on top of eachother but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner for the yare street spre senting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point first on his left the vast sewer of the plat rier eas or to fch in ese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chaos of tsa nd zs under the postoffice and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as the seine where it terminates in a ys econ dly on his right the curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which are also blind court st hird lyon his left the branch of the mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of for kand proceeding from zigzag to zigzag until it ends in the grand crypto fthe outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue de sje une urs without counting little ducts here and the rebe for ere aching the belts ewer which alone could conduct him to some issues uffici ently distant to be safe
had jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the rue saint denis
instead of the ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costing eighth und red livres the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness economic alex pedi ents porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred francs the metre and the bourgeois emas on ryk now nasa petits materia ux small stuff but of all this he knew nothing
head vance dwi than xie ty but with calmness seeing nothing knowing nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence
by degrees we will admit acer tain horror seized upon him
the gloom which envelope dhi mpe net rate dhis spirit
he walked in an enigma
this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable it interlace sinad izzy fashion
it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows
jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it
in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last
how was he toget out
should he find a niss ue
should he find it in time
would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced
should hether een counters ome unexpected knot in the darkness
should hear rive at the inextricable and the impassable
would marius diet here of hemorrhage and he of hunger
should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in an ook of that night
he did not know
he put all the seq uestions to himself with out replying to the m
the intestines of paris for map recipi ce
like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster
all at once he had a surprise
atthe most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in astra ight line hep erc eiv edt hath ewa sno longer ascending the water ofthe rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes
the sewer was now descending
why
was he about to arrive suddenly at the seine
this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater
he continued to advance
it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding
the ridge which the soil of paris for mso nits right bank empties one of its watershed sin to the seine and the other into the grand sewer
the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the water sdesc ribes avery capricious line
the culminating point which is the point of separation of the current sis in the saint ea voy ese we rbe yond the rue michelle comte in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevard san dint he montmartre sewer near the hall es
it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached
he was directing his course towards the belts ewer he was on the right path
but he did not know it
everytime that he encountered a branch he felt ofits angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his router ight ly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet
thus he avoided the quadruple trap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinth sw hich wehave just enumerated
at acer tain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris
overhead he suddenly heard an oise as of thunder distant but continuous
it was the rumbling of vehicles
he had been walking for about half an hour atleast according to the calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet though to fres the had merely change dthe hand with which he was holding marius
the darkness was more profound than ever but it sve ryde pth reassured him
all at once he saw his shadow infront of him
it was outlined on a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely emp urp led the flooring vault under foot and the vault overhead and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage
stupefied he turned round
behind him in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through a tad is tance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense obscurity flame das or to fh or rib lest a rw hich had the air of surveying him
it was the gloomy star of the police which was rising in the sewer
in the rear of that stare ight or ten forms were moving about inac on fused way black upright indistinct horrible

the agents of police were armed with car abi nesw it hbl udg eons swords and poi gnar ds
that which was directed at jean valjean at that moment was the lantern of the patrol of the right bank
this patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind alleys which liebe neath the rue du cadran
while the yw ere passing the irl an tern through the depths of the sebl in dalley sje an valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrate dth it her
he had passed on
the police one merging from the gallery duca dra nha dfa nci edt hat they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the belts ewer
the yw ere in fact the steps of jean valjean
the sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern and the squad had begun to gaze into the mist in the direction when cet he sound proceeded
this was an indescribable moment for jean valjean
happily if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but i ll
it was light and he was shadow
he was very far off and mingled with the darkness of the place
he hugged the wall and halted
moreover he did not understand what it was that was moving behind him
the lack of sleep and food and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of avision ary
he beheld a gleam and around that gleam for ms
what was it
he did not comprehend
jean valjean having paused the sound ceased
the men of the patrol listened and heard nothing they looked and saw nothing
the yhe lda consultation
the re existed at that epoch at this point of the montmartre sewer as orto fcr oss roads called des ervice which was afterwards suppressed on account of the little interior lake which formed the res wallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storm s
the patrol could form aclu steri nthis open space

in the word bou sing otf or med the interim between the word jacob inwhich had become obsolete and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent service
the sergeant gave orders to turn to the left towards the watershed of the seine
if it had occurred to the mto separate into two squads and to go in both directions jean valjean would have been captured
all hung on that thread
it is probable that the instructions of the prefecture foreseeing apos sibility of combat and insurgents in force had forbidden the patrol to part company
the patrol resume dits march leaving jean valjean behind it
of all this movement jean valjean perceived nothing except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled round

it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of the tho fj une on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right shore alittle beyond the pont de sin valid es
the reis nolonger any bank there now
the aspect of the local it yha sch an ged
on that bank two men separate dby acer tain distance seemed to be watching eachother while mutually avoiding eachother
the one who was in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other
it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence
neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though each of the mfe are dby to om uch has tet omake his partner redouble his pace
one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and purpose ly with outwear in gthe air of doing so
the pre yw as crafty and on its guard
the proper relations between the hunted polecat and the hunting dog were observed
the one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize him was rude of aspect and must have been rude to encounter
the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious anyone who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains
the shore was deserted the re were no passersby not even a boat man nor alight erman was in the skiff sw hich were moore dhe re andthe re
it was not easy to see the set women except from the quay opposite and to any person who had scrutinized the matt hat distance the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal being who was uneasy and trembling beneath a ragged blouse and the other like a classic and official person age wearing the frock coat of authority button edt othe chin
perchance the reader might recognize the set women if he were to see the mcl oser at hand
what was the object of the second man
probably to succeed in clothing thefirst more warmly
when a man clothed by the state pursue saman in rags it is in order to make of him a man who is also clothed by the state
only the whole question lies in the color
to be dressed in blue is glorious to be dressed in red is disagreeable
the reis a purple from below
it is probably some unpleasant ness and some purple ofthis sort which the first man is desirous of shirking
if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant meeting place and to some group worth catching
this delicate operation is called spinning
what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the button edu pm anon catching sight from the shore of a hackney coach on the quay as it was passing along empty made as i gnt othe driver the driver understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at afoot pace
this was not observed by the slouching and tattered person age who was in advance
the hackney coach rolled along the trees of the champs elysees
the bus to fthe driver whip in hand could be seen moving along above the parapet
one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to the ira gents contains this article always have on hand aha ck ney coach in case of emergency
while the set women were manoeuvring each on his own side with irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore and which permitted cab driver sar riving from pass yto come to the river and water their horses
this inclined plane was suppressed later on forth esa keo fs ym met ry horses may die of thirst but the eye is gratified
it is probable that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the champs elysees aplac eor name nte dwi thtr ees but in return much infested with police menand where the other could easily exercise violence
this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from more tin by colonel brack and designated as the house of francois i
agua rd house is situated close at hand
to the great surprise of his watch erth eman who was being tracked did not mount bythe inclined plane for watering
he continued to advance along the quay on the shore
his position was visibly becoming critical
what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine
henceforth the re existed no means of ascending to the quay the rewa snoot her inclined plane no staircase and the yw eren earth esp otmar ked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and was lost in the water
the re he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicular wall on his right the river on his left and infront of him and the authorities on his heels
it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition or other
but did this man hope to conceal himself effectually behind that he apo fru bbi shw hich one need but skirt
the expedient would have been puerile
he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing
the innocence of thieves does not extend to that point
the pile of rubbish for me das or to fpr oject iona tthe water 's edge which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the wall of the quay
the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went round its otha the ceased to be seen by the other
the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of this fact to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly
in a few moments he had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it
the re he halted in sheer amazement
the man who mhe had been pursuing was nolonger the re
total eclipse of the man in the blouse
the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty pace slon gthe nit plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the quay
the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without being seen by the man who was following him
what had become of him
the man in the button edu pc oat walked to the extremity of the shore and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes search in g
all at once he smote his brow
he had just perceived at the point where the land came to an end and the water began a large iron grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges
this grating as orto fdo or pierced at the base of the quay opened on the river aswell as onthe shore
abla cki shs trea mpas sedu nder it

beyond the heavy rusty iron bars as orto fda rka nd vaulted corridor could be descried
the man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an air of reproach
as this gazed id not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook it it resisted solid ly
it is probable that it had just been opened although no sound had been heard as in gular circumstance in so rusty agra ting but it is certain that it had been closed again
this indicated that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a hook but a key
this evidence suddenly burst upon the mind of the man who was trying to move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation that is to om uch

that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should see the man emerge or other men enter he posted himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rage of a pointer
the hackney coach which regulate dall its movements on his had in its turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet

chapter iv heals obe ars his cross jean valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused
this march became more and more laborious
the level of the seva ult svar ies the average height is about five feet six inches and has been calculated for the stature of a man jean valjean was forced to be nd over inorder not to strike marius against the vault at every step he had to be ndt he nto rise and to feel incessantly of the wall
the moisture of the stones and the viscous nature of the timber frame work furnished but poor support stow hich to cling either for hand or foot
he stumbled along in the hideous dung heap of the city
the intermittent gleams from the air holes only appeared at very long intervals and were so want hat the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon all the rest was mist miasma opaque ness blackness
jean valjean was both hungry and thirsty especially thirsty and this like the sea was a place full of water where am an cannot drink
his strength which was prodigious as the reader knows and which had been but little decreased by age thanks to his chaste and sober life began to give way nevertheless
fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength decreased it made the weight of his burden increase
marius who was perhaps dead weighed him down as in ert bodies weigh
jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible
between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rats
one of the mwa sfr ight ened to such a degree that he bit him
from time to time abre at hoff res hair reached him through the vent holes of the mouth soft he sewer and reanimated him
it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belts ewer
he was a tfi rst astonished at this sudden widening
he found himself all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hand sco uld not reach the two walls and beneath a vault which his head didnot touch
the grand sewer is infact eight feet wide and seven feet high
atthe point where the montmartre sewer join sthe grand sewer two other subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence and that of the abattoir for masq uar e
between the sef our way sales ssa gac ious man would have remained undecided
jean valjean selected the broadest that is to say the belts ewer
but here the question again came up should he descend or ascend
he thought that the situation required haste and that he must now gain the seine at any risk
in other terms hem us tde scen d
he turned to the left
it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the belts ewer has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other towards pass yand that it is a sits name indicates the subterranean girdle of the paris on the right bank
the grand sewer which is it must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of men ilm on tant terminates if one ascends it in a blind sack that is to say at its ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the knoll of men ilm on tant

this branch which completes the collecting sewer is separated from it under the rue men ilm on tanti tse lfb yap ile which marks the dividing point of the water sbe tween upstream and downstream
if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall
he would have been lost
incase of necessity by retracing his steps alittle way and entering the passage of the filles ducal vair eon condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucher at and by taking the corridors ain t louis then the saint gilles gut on the left the ntu rning to the right and avoiding the saints eba stian gallery he might have reached the amel ots ewer and the ncep rov ide dth at hedi dno tgo astray in the sort of fwh ich lies under the bastille he might have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal
but in order to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous madre pore of the sewer in all its ramifications and in all its opening s
now we must again in sist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing and had anyone asked him in what he was he would have answered in the night
his instincts erv ed him well
to descend was in fact possible safety
he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue saint george sand the long bifurcated corridor of the chaussee d' anti n
alittle beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch he halted
he was extremely wear y

jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the banquet teo fthe sewer

jean valjean to re up his shirt bandaged the young man 's wounds aswell as he was able and stopped the flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with inexpressible hatred

this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are illuminating for the reader jean valjean 's subterranean march jean valjean himself did not possess
nothing to ldh im what zone of the city he was traversing nor what way he had made
only the growing pallor of the pool so flight which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become intermittent instead of continuous the nha ving almost ceased he concluded that he was nolonger under central paris and that he was approaching some solitary region in the vicinity of the outer boulevard sort he extreme outer quays

chapter vi the font is jean valjean found himself in the presence of a font is
this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the champs elysees difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and abad preservative of the subterranean construction son account of its excessive fluidity
this fluidity exceeds event hein consistency of the sands of the quartier saint george sw hich could only be conquered by aston econ struction on a concrete foundation and the clayey strata infected with gas ofthe quartier des martyrs which are so liquid that the only way in which apas sage was effected under the gallery des martyrs was by means of a cast iron pipe
when i nthe old stone sewer beneath the faubourg saint honore in which we now see jean valjean was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing it the quicksand which forms the subsoil of the champs elysees as far as the seine presented such an obstacle that the operation last edn early six months to the great clamor of the dwellers on the riverside particularly those who had hotels and carriage s
the work was more than unhealthy it was dangerous
it is true that the yha dfo urm on ths and a half of rain and three floods of the seine
the font is which jean valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour of the preceding day
the pavement badly sustained by the sub jacen tsa nd had given way and had produced as to ppa geo fthe water
infiltration had taken place as lip had followed
the dislocated bottom had sunk into the ooze
to what extent
impossible to say
the obscurity was more dense the retha nels ewh ere
it was a pit of mire in a cavern of night
jean valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet
he entered this slim e
the rewa swat eron the surface slime at the bottom
he must pass it
to retrace his steps was impossible
marius was dying and jean valjean exhausted
besides where was he togo
jean valjean advanced
moreover the pits eem edf or the first few steps not to be very deep
but in proportion as head vance dhis feet plunged deeper
soon he had the slime upto his calves and water above his knees
he walked on raising marius in his arms as far above the water as he could
the mire now reached to his knees and the water to his waist
he could nolonger retreat
this mudd ense enough for one man could not obviously uphold two
marius and jean valjean would have stood achan ceo fe xtr icat in gthe msel vess in gly
jean valjean continued to advance supporting the dying man who was perhaps a corpse
the water came up to his armpits he felt that he was sinking it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had no wre ached
the density which was his support was also an obstacle
he still held marius on high and with an unheard of expenditure of force head vance dst ill but he was sinking
he had only his head above the water now and his two arms holding up marius
in the old paintings of the deluge the reis am other holding her child thus
he sank still deeper he turned his face to the rear to escape the water and inorder that he might be able to breathe anyone who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows he caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of marius he made a desperate effort and launched his foot forward his foot struck something solid apo into fsu pport
it was high time
hestra ight ened himself up and rooted himself upon that point of support with a sort of fury
this produced upon him the effect of the first step in a staircase leading back to life
the point of support thus encountered in the mire at the supreme moment was the beginning of the other watershed of the pavement which had bent but had not given way and which had curved under the water like a plan kandi nasi ngl epi ece
well built pavement sfor mava ulta ndp oss ess this sort of firmness
this fragment of the vaulting partly submerged but solid was a veritable inclined plane and once on this plan ehe was safe
jean valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other side of the quagmire
as he emerged from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees
here flected that this was but just and here maine dthe ref or sometime with his soul absorbed in words address edt ogo d
her oset oh is feet shivering chilled fouls melling bowed beneath the dying man who mhe was dragging after him all dripping with slim eand his soul filled with a strange light
chapter vii one sometimes run sag round when one fanciest hat on eis disembarking he set out on his way once more
however although he had not left his life in the font is he seemed to have left his strength behind him there
that supreme effort had exhausted him
his lassitude was now suchthat he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall
once he was forced to seat himself on the banquet tein order to alter marius ' position and he thought that he should have to remain the re
but if his vigor was dead his energy was not
her ose again
he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded thus for a hundred paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with the wall
he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall
her aise dhis eyes and atthe extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him he perceived alight
this time it was not that terrible light it was good white light
it was daylight
jean valjean saw the outlet
adam ned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt
it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal
jean valjean was nolonger conscious of fatigue he nolonger felt marius ' weight he found his legs once more of steel her an rather than walked
as he approached the outlet became more and more distinctly defined
it was a point eda rch lower than the vault which gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in a sthe vault grew lower
the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel afa ulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been corrected
jean valjean reached the outlet
the re he halted
it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out
the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all appearance rarely swung on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone jam bby at hick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous brick
the keyhole could be seen and the robust latch deeply sun kint heir on staple
the door was plainly double lock ed
it was one of those prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing
beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the shore very narrow but sufficient for escape
the distant quays paris that gulf inwhich one so easily hide son ese lft he broad horizon liberty
onthe right downstream the bridge of jena was discernible on the left upstream the bridge of the invalid est he place would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape
it was one of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the grand caillou
flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating
it might have been half past eight o'clock in the evening
the day was declining
jean valjean laid marius down along the wall on the dry portion of the vaulting the nhe went to the grating and clenched both fists round the bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move
the grating did not stir
jean valjean seized the bars one after the other inthe hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to make of it aleve rw herewith to raise the door or to break the lock
not a bars tir red
the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed in the irs ock ets

the obstacle was invincible
the rewa snom ean so fopen in gthe gate

what was he todo
what was to become of him
he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey which he had already taken
besides how was he to again traverse that quagmire when ceh ehad only extricated himself as by amir acle
and after the quagmire was the reno tthe police patrol which assuredly could not be twice avoided
and the nw hither was he togo
what direction should he pursue
to follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal
if he were to reach another outlet he would find it obstructed by a plug or agra ting
every outlet was undoubtedly closed in that manner
chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered but it was evident that all the other sewer mouth swer ebar red
he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison
all was over
everything that jean valjean haddon ewa suse less
exhaustion had ended in failure
the yw ere both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows
he turned his back to the grating and fell upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees
this was the last drop of anguish
of what was he thinking during this profound depression
neither of himself nor of marius
he was thinking of cosette
chapter viii the torn coat tail in the midst of this prostration aha nd was laid on his shoulder and a low voice said to him half share s
some person in that gloom
nothing so closely resembles a dream as despair
jean valjean thought that he was dreaming
he had heard no footsteps
was it possible
her aise dhis eyes
aman stood before him
this man was clad in a blouse his feet were bare hehe ldh is shoes in his left hand he had evidently removed the minor der to reach jean valjean without allowing his steps to be heard
jean valjean did not hesitate for an instant
unexpected as was this encounter this man was known to him
the man was the nardi er
although awakened soto speak with a start jean valjean accustomed to alarms and steel edt oun for ese en shocks that must be promptly parried instantly regained possession of his presence of mind
moreover the situation could not be made worse acer tain degree of distress is nolonger capable of acres cen do and the nardi erh ims elf could add nothing to this blackness of this night

jean valjean as we have just stated had his back turned to the light and he was more over so disfigured so be mired soble edin gth at hew ould have been unrecognizable in full noonday
onthe contrary illuminated by the light from the grating ace lla rli ght it is true livid yet precise in its livid ness the nardi eras the energetic popular metaphor express esi tim media tel yle ape dint oj ean valjean 's eyes
this inequality of conditions suffice dto assures ome advantage to jean valjean in that mysterious due lw hich was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men
the encounter took place between jean valjean veiled and the nardi eru nmas ked
jean valjean immediately perceived that the nardi erd id notre cogni zeh im

but still you must get out of this
that is true said jean valjean

look here
jean valjean remained stupid the expression belongs to the elder corneille to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real
it was providence appearing in horrible guise and his good angels pring in gfr omt he earth in the form of the nardi er
the nardi erth rust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean

jean valjean to okt her ope

the nardi ers napped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to him

while expressing his approval of jean valjean 's silence he endeavored to force him to talk
he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile and he exclaimed with out how ever raising his tone apropos of that quagmire you 're a heart yani mal
why did n't you to sst heman in the re

the more loquacious the nardi erbe came the more mute was jean valjean

the rewa son esi ngu larc irc ums tance the nardi er 's manners were not simple he had not the air of being wholly at his ease while affecting an air of mystery he spoke low from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth and muttered hush
it was difficult to divine why

how much did the stiff have in his bags
jean valjean search ed his pocket s
it was his habit as the reader will remember to always have some money about him
the mournful life of expedient stow hich he had been condemned imposed this as a law upon him
onthis occasion however he had been caught unprepared
when donning his uniform of an ational guardsman on the preceding evening he had forgotten doleful lya bso rbe dash ewa sto take his pocket book
he had only some small change in his fob
he turned out his pocket all soaked with ooze and spread out on the banquet teo fthe vault one louis d'or two five franc pieces and five or six large sous
the nardi erth rust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck
you knocked him over cheap said he
he set to feeling the pockets of jean valjean and marius with the greatest familiarity
jean valjean who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light let him have his way
while handling marius ' coat the nardi erw it hthe skill of a pickpocket and without being noticed by jean valjean to re off as trip which he concealed under his blouse probably thinking that this morse lof stuff might serve later on to identify the assassinated man and the assassin
however he found no more than the thirty francs
that 's true said he both of you together have no more than that
and forgetting his motto half share she took all
hehe sit at eda little over the large sous
after due reflection he took the mals om uttering nevermind

that done he once more drew the big key from under his blouse
now my friend you must leave
it 's like the fair here you pay when you go out

and he began to laugh
had heinle nding to this strange rthe aid of his key and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and disinterested in tention of rescuing a nass as sin
we may be permitted to doubt this
the nardi erh el ped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders the nhe betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefoot edma king jean valjean as i gnt of oll ow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection finished he placed the key in the lock
the bolts lipped back and the gates wun go pen
it neither grated nor squeaked
it moved very softly
it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed
this softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive going sand coming ssi lenten trance sand exits of nocturnal menand the wolf like tread of crime
the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band
this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods
the nardi ero pened the gate alittle way allowing just sufficient space for jean valjean to pass out closed the grating again gave the key ado ubl et urn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without making any more noise than a breath
he seemed to walk with the velvet paws of a tiger
amo men tla tert hath ideo us providence had retreated into the invisibility
jean valjean found himself in the open air

evening was unfolding over the head of jean valjean all the sweetness of the infinite
it was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither yes no rno
night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose one self atal it tled is tance and yet there was sufficient daylight to permit of recognition at close quarters

jean valjean could not refrain from contemplating that vast clear shadow which rested over him thoughtfully he bathed in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal heaven s
the nhe be ntd own swiftly to marius as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him and dipping up water in the hollow of his hand he gently sprinkled afew drops on the latter 's face

jean valjean was on the point of dipping his hand in the river once more when all at once he experienced an indescribable embarrassment such as a person feels when the reiss omeo neb ehi nd him who mhe does not see
wehave already alluded to this impression with which everyone is familiar
he turned round

an ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight at hough tfu lma non account of the bludgeon
jean valjean recognized javert
the reader has divine dno doubt that the nardi er 's pursue rw as no other than javert
javert after his unlooked for escape from the barricade had beta ken himself to the prefecture of police had rendered ave rba lac count to the prefect in person in a brief audience had the nim media tel ygo neon duty again which implied the note the reader will recollect which had been captured on his person acer tains ur veil lance of the shore on the right bank of the seine near the champs elysees which had for sometime past aroused the attention of the police
the re he had caught sight of the nardi era nd had followed him
the reader knows the rest
thus it will be easily understood that that gratings oob ligi ngl yo pened to jean valjean was a bit of cleverness on the nardi er 's part

jean valjean had fallen from one danger upon another

javert did not recognize jean valjean who as we have stated nolonger looked like himself
he did not unfold his arms he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist by an imperceptible movement and said in a curt calm voice who are you

jean valjean replied and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse javert it is with regard to him that i desire to speak to you

that is all that i ask of you
javert 's face contract edas was always the case when anyone seemed to think him capable of making a concession
nevertheless he did not say no

however he could not be greatly surprised that javert should now have a sort of haughty confidence in him the confidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of its claws seeing that jean valjean had made up his mind to surrender himself and to make an end of it

javert derailed chapter i javert javert passed slowly down the rue de l' homme arm e
he walked with drooping head for the first time in his life and likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his back
upto that day javert had borrowed from napoleon 's attitudes only that which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest that which is expressive of uncertainty with the hands behind the back had been unknown to him
now achan geha dta ken place his whole person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety
he plunged into the silent street s
nevertheless he followed one given direction
he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quaid eso rme ssk irt edt he quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from the post ofthe place ducha tele tatt he angle of the pont not red am e

javert leaned both elbows on the parapet his chin resting in both hands and while his nails were mechanical lyt wine dint he abundance of his whiskers he meditated
an ove lty are volution acat astro phe ha dj us tta ken place in the depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself
javert was undergoing horrible suffering
for several hours javert had ceased to be simple
he was troubled that brains olim pid in its blindness had lost its transparency that crystal was clouded
javert felt duty divided within his conscience and he could not conceal the fact from himself
when he had so unexpectedly encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine the reha dbe en in him something of the wolf which regains his grip on his prey and ofthe dog who finds his master again
he beheld before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known more than one straight line
and the poignant anguish layin this that the two paths were contrary to eachother
one of the ses trai ght lines excluded the other
which of the two was the true one
his situation was indescribable
to owe his life to a malefactor to accept that debt and to repay it to be in spite of himself on a level with a fugitive from justice and to repay his service with another service to allow it to be said to him go and to say to the latter in his turn befree to sacrifice to personal motives duty that general obligation and to be conscious in those personal motives of something that was also general and perchance superior to be trays ociety inorder to remain true to his conscience that all the sea bsu rd it ies should be realized and should accumulate upon him this was what overwhelmed him
one thing had amazed him this was that jean valjean should have done him a favor and one thing petrified him that he javert should have done jean valjean afa vor
where did he stand
he sought to comprehend his position and could nolonger find his bearings
what was he todo now
to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean valjean at liberty was bad
in the first case the man of authority fell lower than the man of the galleys in the second acon vic tro sea bovet he law and set his foot upon it
in both cases dishonor for him javert
the rewa sdi sgr a cei nan yresolution at which he might arrive
destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicular lyf rom the impossible and beyond which life is nolonger anything but apr eci pic e
javert had reached on eof those extremities
one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think
the very violence of all the sec on flict in gem oti o nsf or ced him to it
though twas something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful
in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion and it irritated him to have that within him
though to nan ysu bject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue thought on the day which had just passed was a torture
nevertheless it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after such shocks and render to himself an account of himself
what he had just done made him shudder
he javert had seen fit to decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the whole social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code upon a release this had suite dhi mhe had substitute dhis own affairs for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable
everytime that he brought himself face to face with this deed without an ame which he had committed he trembled from head to foot
upon what should he decide
one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to the rue de l' homme arm eand commit jean valjean to prison
it was clear that that was what he ought to do
he could not
something barred his way in that direction
something
what
isthe rein the world anything outside of the tribunal sex ecu to rys ente ncest he police and the authorities
javert was overwhelmed
aga lle y slaves acre d
acon vic twh oco uld not be touched by the law
and that the deed of javert
was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the manmade to proceed with vigor the manmade to submit that the set women who were both the things of the laws hould have come to such a pass that both of the mha dset themselves above the law
what the n
such enorm it ies were to happen and noone was to be punished
jean valjean stronger than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he javert was to go on eating the government 's bread
his rever yg radu all ybe came terrible
he might athwart this rever yha veal sore proach ed himself on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue de sfi lles ducal vair ebu the never even though to fth at
the lesser fault was lost in the greater
besides that insurgent was obviously a deadman and legally death puts an end to pursuit
jean valjean was the load which weighed up on his spirit
jean valjean disconcerted him
all the axioms which had served him as points of support all his life long had crumbled away in the presence of this man
jean valjean 's generosity towards him javert crushed him
other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities
m
madeleine reappeared behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed in such fashion that the yno wfor med but one which was venerable
javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his soul admiration for a convict
respect for a galley slave is that apos sible thing
he shuddered at it yet could not escape from it
in vain did he struggle he was reduced to confess in his inmost heart the sublimity of that wretch
this was odious
abe nevo lent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement acon vic tre turning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy saving him who had smitten him kneeling on the height so fv irt uem or enea rly akin to an angel than to a man
javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed
things could not go on inthis manner
certainly an dwe insist upon this point he had not yielded without resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous her ow hoen raged almost as much as he amazed him
twenty times as he sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had roared with in him
as core of time she had been tempted to fling himself upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to arrest him
what more simple infact
to cry out at the first post that the ypa ssed here is a fugitive from justice who has broken his ban
to summon the gendarmes and say to the mth is man is your s
the nto goof flea vingt hatco nde mne dman the reto ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter
this man is forever apr iso nero fthe law the law may do with him what it will
what could be more just
javert had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to apprehend the man and the nasa tpr ese nthe had not been able to do it and everytime that his arm had been raised convulsively towards jean valjean 's collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice astra nge voice crying to him it is well
deliver up your savior
the nha vet he basin of pontius pilate brought and was hyo urc laws
the nhis reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he beheld him self javert degraded
acon vic twas his benefactor
but the nw hy had he permitted that man to leave him alive
he had the right to be killed in that barricade
he should have asserted that right
it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force
his supreme anguish was the loss of certain ty
he felt that he had been uprooted
the code was nolonger anything more than a stump in his hand
he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species
the reha dta ken place within him as ent imental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto
to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice
a whole or der of unexpected facts had cropped up and subjugated him
a whole new world was dawning on his soul kindness accepted and repaid devotion mercy indulgence violence scom mitted by pity on austerity respect for persons no more definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a tear in the eye of the law noone know sw hat justice according to go dru nni ngi nin verses ense to justice according to me n
he perceived amid the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown moral sun it horrified and dazzled him
an owl for ced to the gaze of an eagle
he said to himself that it was true that the re were exceptional cases that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled obedience that the virtue of a convict might set as nar efor the virtue of the function ary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and here flected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified against a surprise
he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist
this convict had been good
and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been good also
so he was becoming depraved
he found that he was a coward
he conceived a horror of himself
javert 's ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was to be irreproachable
now he had just failed in this
how had he come to such a pass
how had all this happened
he could not have to ldh ims elf
he clasped his head in both hands but in spite of all that he could do heco uld not contrive to explain it to himself
he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which he javert was the slave
not for a single instant while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that he entertained the idea of releasing him
it was in some sort without his consciousness that his hand had relaxed and had let him go free
all sorts of interrogation points flash ed before his eyes
he put questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies frightened him
he asked himself what has that convict done that desperate fellow who miha vep urs ued event opers ecution and who has had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me mylife in showing mercy upon me
his duty
no
something more
and i in showing mercy upon him in my turn what have ido ne
my duty
no
something more
so there is something beyond duty
here he took fright his balance became disjointed one of the scale sfe lli ntot he abyss the other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below
without being in the least in the world what is called volta irian or a philosopher or incredulous being on the contrary respectful by instinct to ward sthe established church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole or der was his dog maand suffice dfor him ever since he had attained to man 's estate and the rank of a function ary he had centre dne arly all his religion in the police

but how was he to set about handing in his resignation to go d
however things might stand and it was to this point that he reverted constantly on efa ctd omi nated everything else for him and that was that he had just committed at err ible infraction of the law
he had just shut his eyes on an escape dc on vic twh ohad broken his ban
he had just set a galley slave atlarge
he had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to the m
that was what he had done
he nolonger understood himself
the very reason sfor his action escaped him only the irv ert igo was left with him
upto that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity engenders
this faith had quitted him this probity had deserted him
all that he had believed in melted away
truth sw hich he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably
henceforth he must be a different man
he was suffering from the strange pain sofa conscience abruptly operated on forth ecat arac t
he saw that which it was repugnant to him to be hold
he felt himself emptied useless put out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved
authority was dead within him
he had no longer any reason for existing
at err ible situation
to be touched
to be granite and to doubt
to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath one 's breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart
to come to the pass of returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil
to be the watchdog and to lick the intruder 's hand
to be ice and melt

that which was passing in javert was the fam pou xof are cti linear conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probit yw hich had been irresistibly launched in astra ight line and was breaking against god
it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that the engineer of authority mounted on the blind ironhorse with its rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light
that the immovable the direct the correct the geometrical the passive the perfect could be nd
that the res hould exist for the locomotive a road to damascus

did javert penetrate it
did javert account for it to himself
evidently he did not
but beneath the pressure of that incontestable in comprehensibility he felt his brain bursting
he was less the mantra nsf igure dth an the victim of this prodigy
in all this hep erc eiv edon lyth etre men do usd if ficult yof existence
it seemed to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever
he was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head
upto this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing incomprehensible nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided for authority was a plane surface there was no fallin it nodi zzine ssi nits presence
javert had never be held the unknown except from below
the irregular the unforeseen the disorder edo pen in gof chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches
now javert threw himself back and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition a gulf on high
what
one was dismantled from top to bottom
one was disconcerted absolutely
in what could one trust
that which had been agreed upon was giving way
what
the defect in society 's armor could be discovered by a magnanimous wretch
what
an honest servi to rof the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to escape and the crime of arresting him
everything was not settled in the order sgi ven by the state to the function ary

what all this was real
was it true that an ex ruffian weighed down with conviction sco uld rise erect and end by being in the right
was this credible
were there cases in which the laws hould retire before transfigured crime and stammer its excuses
yes that was the state of the case
and javert saw it
and javert had to uche dit
and not only could he not deny it but he had taken part in it

it was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity

was anarchy the non the point of now descending from on high
thus and in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced and society and the human race and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and terrible feature thus the penal law sthe thing judge dthe for cedu etol egis lation the decrees of the sovereign court st he magistracy the government prevention repression of ficial cruelty wisdom legal infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all this was rubbish as hap eles smas sch a osh ehi msel fja vert the spy of order in corrupt ibility in the service of the police the bulldog providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect a tthe summit of all that ruin a man with agree ncap on his head and a halo round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had come this was the fearful vision which he bore with in his soul
was this to be endured
no
avi olen tstate if ever such existed
the re were only two ways of escaping from it
one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys
the other
javert quitted the parapet and with header ect this time betook himself with a firm tread towards the station house indicated by alan tern at one of the corner soft he placed uch at el et
on arriving there he saw through the window as erg ean to fpo lice and he entered

javert to oka penan dash eet of paper and began to write
this is what he wrote a few observations for the good ofthese rvice
in the first place ibe gmo nsi eur lep ref et toca sth is eyes on this
secondly prisoners on arriving after examination takeoff the irs hoes and stand barefoot on the flagstones while the yare being searched
many of the mco ugh on the irre turn to prison
this entails hospital expenses
thirdly the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions it is requisite that atleast two agents should never loses ight of eachother so that incase one agents hould for any cause grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take his place
fourthly it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the madelon ette sinter dicts the prisoner from having a chair even by paying for it
fifthly in the madelon ette sthe rear eon lyt wob ars to the canteen so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand

ninth ly it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating inthe courtyard of the prefecture the interrogation spu tb ythe magistrates to prisoners

he took his pickaxe which was very sharply pointed

on scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side where the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild boul at ruelle suddenly caught sight of his man
hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him
the man entered or rather glided into an open glade at a considerable distance masked by large trees but with which boul at ruelle was perfectly familiar on account of having noticed near a large pile of porous stones an ailing chestnut tree bandaged with a sheet of zinc nailed directly upon the bar k

chapter ii marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic war for along time marius was neither dead nora live
for many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms caused more by the shock soft he wound son the head than by the wounds themselves

finally on the tho fse pte mber four months to a day after the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius
convalescence began
but marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched out on along chair on account of the results called up by the fracture of his collarbone
the real ways is a last wound like that which will not close and which prolongs the dressing sind efi nitely to the great annoyance of the sick person
however this long illness and this long convalescence save dhi mfr oma llp urs uit
in france there is now rath not even of a public character which six months will not extinguish
revolts in the present state of society are so much the fault of everyone that the yare followed by acer tain necessity of shutting the eyes
let us add that the inexcusable gis que to rder which enjoined doctors to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the council so fwa rd id not dare to trouble anyone

he overwhelmed the doctor with questions
he did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over again
onthe day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of danger the good man was in a delirium
he made his porter apres ent of three louis
that evening on his return to his own chamber he danced a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the following song jeanne est nee a fougere amour tuv is enell evra in idd ' une berger ecar c'est dans sa prune lle j'adore son jup on que tu me tst on car quoi s

every moment he kept asking the doctor is he nolonger in danger
he gazed upon marius with the eyes of agra nd mother
he brooded over him while he ate
he nolonger knew himself he nolonger rendered himself an account of himself
marius was the master of the house there was abdication in his joy he was the grandson of his grandson
in the state of joy in which he then was he was the most venerable of children
in his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent he stepped behind him to smile
he was content joyous delighted charming young
his white locks added agent lema jest yto the gay radiance of his visage
when grace is mingled with wrinkles it is adorable
the reis an indescribable aurora in beaming old age
as for marius as he allowed the mto dress his wounds and care for him he had but one fixed idea cosette
after the fever and delirium had left him he did not again pronounce her name and it might have been supposed that he nolonger thought of her
hehe ldh is peace precisely because his soul was the re
he did not know what had become of cosette the whole affair of the rue de la chan vre rie was like a cloud in his memory shadows that were almost indistinct floated through his mind epon in ega vro chem abe uft he then a rdi ersa ll his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of the barricade the strange passage of m
fau che le vent through that adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest he understood nothing connected with his own life he did not know how norby who mhe had been saved and noone of those around him knew this all that the yha dbe enable to tell him was that he had been brought home at night in a hackney coach to the rue de sfi lles ducal vair epa stp resent future were not hing more to him than the mist of a vague idea but in that fog there was one immovable point on ecl ear and precise outlines ome thing made of granite are solution awi llt of indc oset teon cem or e
for him the idea of life was not distinct from the idea of cosette
he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept the one without the other and he was immo va bly resolved to exact of any person whatever who should desire to force him to live from his grandfather from fat efr omh ell the restitution of his vanished eden
he did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed
let us here emphasize one detail he was not won over and was but little softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather
in the first place he was not in the secret then in his reverie sofa nin valid which were still feverish possibly hedis trusted this tenderness as a strange and novel thing which had for its object his conquest

marius said to himself that it was allright solo nga she marius did not speak and let things take the irc our seb utt hat when it became a question of cosette he would find another face and that his grandfather 's true attitude would be unmasked

and with health there returned to him as orto fha rsh ness towards his grandfather
the old man was gently pain ed by this
m
gillen or man dwi thou thow ever allowing it to appear observed that marius ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness had not once called him father
it is true that he did not say monsieur to him but he contrived not to say either the one or the other by means of acer tain way of turning his phrases
obviously a crisis was approaching
as almost always happens in such cases marius skirmish ed before giving battle by way of proving himself
this is called feeling the ground
one morning it came to pass that m

the old man held his peace and uttered not as ound during the remainder of that day
marius who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of his early years interpreted this silence as a profound concentration of wrath aug ured from it aho tcon flict and augmented his preparations for the fray in the inmost recesses of his mind
he decided that incase of a refusal he would tear off his band ages dislocate his collarbone that he would lay bare all the wounds which he had left and would reject all food
his wounds were his munitions of war
he would have cosette or die
he awaited the propitious moment with the craft ypa tien ceo fthe sick
that moment arrived

the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in marius ' chamber at the moment when cosette entered it
precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and gazing over it at cosette
she appeared on the threshold its eem edt ohim that she was surrounded by a glory
adorable
he exclaimed
the nhe blew his nose noisily
cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven
she was a sth or ough lya la rmed as anyone can be by happiness
she stammered all pale yet flushed she wanted to fling herself into marius ' arms and dared not
ashamed of loving in the presence of all the sep eople
people are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone
lovers have no need of any people whatever
with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile
it was monsieur fau che le vent it was jean valjean
he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely in black in perfect lyne wga rme nts and with a white cravat
the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct bourgeois in this probable not a ryt he fear inspiring bearer of the corpse who had sprung up at his door on the night of the tho fj une tattered muddy hideous haggard his face mask edinb loo dan dmi res upport in gin his arms the fainting marius still his porter 's scent was aroused

m
fau che le vent in marius ' chamber remained apart near the door
he had under his arm apac kage which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume envelope din paper
the enveloping paper was of agree nish hue and appeared to be mould y
does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm
mademoiselle gillen or man dwh odi dno tli keb ooks demanded in a low to neo fni colette

what the n
is that his fault
monsieur boul ardo neo fm yac quaint ances never walked out without a book under his arm either and heal ways had some old volume hugged to his heart like that
and with a bow he said aloud monsieur tranche levent
father gillen or man ddi dno tdo it intentionally but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his
monsieur tranche levent ihave the honor of asking you on behalf of my grandson baron marius pont mercy for the hand of mademoiselle
monsieur tranche levent bowed
that 's settled said the grandfather
and turning to marius and cosette with both arms extended in blessing he cried permission to adore eachother

as for marius and cosette the yw ereg a zing at eachother while this was going on the yha rd lyh eed edt his detail
chapter vde posit your money in a forest rather than with an otar ythe reader has no doubt understood without necessitating a lengthy explanation that jean valjean after the champ mathieu affair had been able thanks to his first escape of a few days 'd uration to come to paris and to withdraw inseason from the hands of laffitte the sum earned by him under the name of monsieur madeleine at montreuil sur mer and that fearing that he might be recaptured which eventually happen edhe had buried and hidden that sum in the forest of mont ferme il in the local it yk now nast he bla rub otto m
the sum six hundred and thirty thousand francs all in bank bills was not very bulky and was contained in a box only in order to preserve the box from dampness he had placed it in a coffer filled with chestnut shaving s
in the same coffer he had placed his other treasures the bishop 's candlestick s
it will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape from montreuil sur mer
the man seen on eev ening for the first time by boul at ruelle was jean valjean
later on every time that jean valjean needed money he went to get it in the bla rub otto m
hence the absence sw hich wehave mentioned
he had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather in a hiding place known to himself alone
when he beheld marius convalescent feeling that the hour was a than dwh ent hat money might prove of service heh a dgo net oge tit it was he again whom boul at ruelle had seen in the woods but on this occasion in the morning instead of inthe evening
boul at re ull ein her it ed his pickaxe
the actual sum was five hundred and eight yf our thousand five hundred francs
jean valjean with drew the five hundred francs for himself
we shall see hereafter he thought
the difference between that suman dthe six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years from to
the five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs
jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney piece where the yg littered to the great admiration of toussaint
moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert
the story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in the moniteur how apo lice inspector name dj avert had been found drowned under a boat belonging to some laundress esb et we ent he ponta uch an gea ndt he pont neuf and that a writing left by this man otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a fit of mental aberration and as uic ide
infact thought jean valjean since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must have been already mad
chapter vi the two old men doeverything each one after his own fashion to render cosette happy everything was made ready for the wedding
the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february
it was the nde cember
afew ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed
the grandfather was not the least happy ofthe mall
here maine dfor aqua rte rof an hour at a time gazing at cosette
the wonderful beautiful girl
he exclaimed

she is without exception them ost charming girl that ihave ever seen in my life

how graceful
one can not live otherwise than nobly with such a creature

cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise
the transition had not been softened and the yw ould have been stunned had the ynot been dazzled by it
do you understand anything about it
said marius to cosette
no replied cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us
jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy
he has ten edt owa rds cosette 's happiness with a smu char doran dapp are ntl yw it has much joy as cosette herself
as he had been a mayor he understood how to solve that delicate problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted cosette 's civil status
if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might prevent the marriage who knows
he extricated cosette from all difficulties
he concocted for her afam il yof dead people as ure means of note ncount erin gan y objections
cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other fau che le vent
two brothers fau che le vent had been gardeners to the convent of the petit pic pus
inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the good nuns not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity and not attach in gan y importance to the matter had never understood exactly of which of the two fau che le vent sco set tewa sthe daughter

the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety fourth ousa ndf ran csb utt ent hous and francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle euph ras ie five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent
this legacy deposited in the hands of a third party was to be turned over to cosette at her majority or at the date of her marriage
this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million
the re were some peculiarities here and the reit is true but the yw eren otn otice done ofthe interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love the other sby the six hundred thousand francs
cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that oldman who ms he had solo ngc all edfa the r
he was merely a kinsman another fau che le vent washer real father
at any other time this would have broken her heart
but at the ineffable moment which she was the npa ssi ngt hr ough it cast but as light shadow afa in tcl oud and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long
she had marius
the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life
and the ncos ette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigma saro und here very being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain renunciation s
nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean father
cosette happy as the angels was enthusiastic over father gillen or man d

while jean valjean was building up for cosette an or mals it uation in society and an unassailable status m

nothing so amused him as being magnificent

he had acted impetuously according to his wont having a despot turned slave but as in gle thought to satisfy marius
as for the aunt it had not even occurred to him that the aunt existed and that she could have an opinion of her own and sheep as she was this had vexed her
somewhat resentful in her in most soul but impassive external lys he had said to herself my father has settled the question of the marriage without reference to me is hall settle the question of the inheritance without consulting him

he furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles
he had the ceiling and walls hung with an extraordinary stuff which he had by him in the piece and which he believed to have emanated from utrecht with a buttercup colored satin groundcover ed with velvet auric ula blossoms

it seemed as though this had been agreed upon
every girl needs a chaperon
cosette could not have come with out m

he accepted it
by dint of discussing political matters vaguely and without precision from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all men they came to say alittle more than yes and no
once on the subject of education which marius wished to have free and obligatory multiplied under all forms lavished on everyone like the air and the sun in a word respirable for the entire population they were in unison and the yal most converse d

however the nature so fbo thm en were rigid no question from marius to m

such an idea had not even occurred to him
wehave already indicated this characteristic detail
two men who have a secret in common and who by a sort of tacit agreement exchange not a word on the subject are less rare than is commonly supposed
once only did marius make the attempt
he introduced into the conversation the rue de la chan vre rie and turning to m
fau che le vent he said to him ofcourse you are acquainted with that street
what street
the rue de la chan vre rie
ihave no idea of the name of that street replied m
fau che le vent in the most natural manner in the world
the response which bore upon the name of the street and not upon the street itself appeared to marius to be more conclusive than it really was

ihave been subject to a hallucination
it was someone who resembled him
m
fau che le vent was not there
' chapter viii two men impossible to find marius ' enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind other preoccupation s
while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective research est obe made

it was impossible for him to leave a llt he sea rre ars of suffering behind him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain a quit tance from the past
that the nardi erw as a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he had saved colonel pont mercy
the nardi erw as a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius
and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battlefield of waterloo was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father sofa rast he nardi erw as concerned was in the strange position of being indebted to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any gratitude
none of the various agents who mma riu sem ployed succeeded in discovering an yt race of the nardi er
obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter
madame the nardi erh add ie din prison pending the trial
the nardi era nd his daughter az elma the only two remaining of that lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom
the gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those being s
onthe surface there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in and that the plummet maybe dropped
madame the nardi erbe in gde adb oul at ruelle being eliminated from the case cla queso us having disappeared the principal persons accused having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the go rbe a uh ouse had come to nothing

moreover by thrusting the nardi erba ckin to the very remote std ept hst hr ough a fear of being recaptured this sentence added to the density of the shadows which envelope dth is man
as for the other person as for the unknown man who had saved marius the research es were at first to some extent successful then came to an abrupt conclusion
the ysu ccee de din finding the carriage which had brought marius to the rue de sfi lles ducal vair eon the evening of the tho fj une
the coachman declared that onthe tho fj une in obedience to the command sofa police agent he had stood from three o'clock in the afternoon until nightfall on the quaid esch amps elysees above the outlet of the grand sewer that towards nine o'clock in the evening the grating of the sewer which abuts on the bank of the river had opened that aman had emerged there from bearing on his shoulders another man who seemed to be dead that the agent who was on the watch at that point had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man that at the order of the police agent he the coachman had taken all those folks in to his carriage that the yha dfi rst driven to the rue de sfi lles ducal vair eth at the yha dthe red epos it edt he deadman that the dead man was monsieur marius and that he the coachman recognized him perfectly although he was alive this time that afterwards the yha dente red the vehicle again that he had whipped up his horse safe wpa ces from the gate of the archives they had called to him to halt that the rein the street the yha dpa id him and left him and that the police agent had led the other man away that he knew nothing more that the night had been very dark
marius as we have said recalled nothing
he only remembered that he had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he was falling back wards in to the barricade the never yth in gva nished sofa rash ewa sconce rne d
he had only regained consciousness at m
gillen or man d' s
he was lost in conjecture s
he could not doubt his own identity
still how had it come to pass that having fallen in the rue de la chan vre rie he had been picked up by the police agent on the banks of the seine near the pont de sin valid es
someone had carried him from the quartier desha lles to the champs elysees
and how
through the sewer
unheard of devotion
someone
who
this was the man for whom marius was searching
ofthis man who was his savior nothing not at race not the faintest indication
marius although forced to preserve great reserve in that direction pushed his inquiries as far as the prefecture of police
the reno more than elsewhere did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment
the prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney coachman
the yha dno knowledge of any arrest having been made on the tho fj une at the mouth of the grand sewer
no report of any agent had been received the re upon this matter which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable
the invention of this fable was attributed to the coachman
acoa chm an who wants a gratuity is capable of anything even of imagination
the fact was assured nevertheless and marius could not doubt it unless he doubted his own identity as we have just said
everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable
what had become of that man that mysterious man who mthe coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious marius and who mthe police agent on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing a nin surge nt
what had become ofthe agent himself
why had this agent preserved silence
had the man succeeded in making his escape
had he bribed the agent
why did this man given osi gno fl if et omar ius who owed everything to him
his disinterestedness was no less tremendous than his devotion
why had not that man appeared again
perhaps he was above compensation but noone is above gratitude
washed ead
who was the man
what sort of a face had he
noone could tell him this
the coachman answered the night was very dark
basque and nicolette all in a flutter had looked only at the ir young master all covered with blood
the porter whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of marius had been the only one to take note of the man in question and this is the description that he gave that man was terrible
marius had the bloodstained clothing which he had worn when he had been brought back to his grandfather preserved in the hope that it would prove of service in his research es
one xa mining the coat it was found that one skirt had been torn in asin gular way
apiece was missing
one evening marius was speaking in the presence of cosette and jean valjean of the whole of that singular adventure of the innumerable inquiries which he had made and ofthe fruitless ness of his efforts
the cold countenance of monsieur fau che le vent angered him
he exclaimed with a vivacity which had something of wrath in it yes that man who ever he may have been was sublime
do you know what he did sir
he intervened like an archangel
he must have flung himself into the midst of the battle have stolen me away have opened the sewer have dragged me into it and have carried me through it
he must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries be nto ver weighed down in the dark in the cesspool more than a league and a half sir with a corpse upon his back
and with what object
with the sole object of saving the corpse
and that corpse iwas
he said to himself ' the rema yst ill be a glimpse of life there perchance iwill risk my own existence for that miserable spark
' and his existence her is ked not once but twenty times
and every step was a danger
the proof of it is that one merging from the sewer he was arrested
do you know sir that that man did all this
and he had no recompense to expect
what was i
an insurgent
what was i
one of the conquered
oh
if cosette 's six hundred thousand francs were mine

the manner of marriage in was not the same as it is today
france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off one 's wife of fleeing oncoming out of church of hiding oneself with shame from one 's happiness and ofcom bining the way sofa bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs

old shoes and slippers donot as yet for map art of our nuptial celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall come to that
in a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full trot
strange to say at that epoch people still imagine dth at a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short itis ago oda nda venerable thing that the fusion of the set wod est in ies when cea family is destined to springs hould begin at home and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as it swit ness

the grandfather haughty with head held high amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegance soft he epoch of barras escorted cosette
he took the place of jean valjean who on account of his arm being still in a sling could not give his hand to the bride
jean valjean dressed in black followed the mwi tha smile

she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky its eem edas though she feared that she should wake up from her dream
her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty

it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuousness in marius and with modest yin cosette
the ysa id to eachother in low tones we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plume t
the folds of cosette 's gown lay across marius
such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality
one possesses a nd one supposes
one still has time before one to divine
the emotion on that day of being a tmi dda yand of dreaming of midnight is indescribable
the delights of the set woh ear tso ver flowed upon the crowd and inspired the passersby with cheerfulness
people halted in the rue saint antoine infront of saint paul to gaze through the windows ofthe carriage at the orange flowers quivering on cosette 's head
the nth eyre turned home to the rue de sfi lles ducal vair e
marius triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase up which he had been born ein a dying condition

cosette did not recognize him
he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman
how right iwas not to believe in that story about the lancer
said father gillen or man dto himself
cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean
she was in unison with father gillen or man dwh ile heere cted joy in to aphorisms and maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume
happiness desires that all the world should be happy
she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was alittle girl
she cares sed him with her smile

illumination as brilliant as the daylight is the necessary seasoning of agreat joy

the empty space sbe tween the candelabra were filled in with bouquets so that where the rewa snot alight the rewa saf lower
in the antechamber three violin sand afl utes of tly played quartet tes by haydn
jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing room behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him
afew moments before the ysa tdo wnt ota ble cosette came as though inspired by a sudden whim and made him a deep courtesy spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tender lyr og uis hgl ances he asked him father are you satisfied

well then laugh
jean valjean began to laugh
afew moments later basque announced that dinner was served
the guests preceded by m

from the moment when marius to ok his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself
she set her sweet little foot shod in white satin on marius ' foot
the armchair being occupied m
fau che le vent was obliterated and nothing was lacking
and five minutes after ward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness

chapter iii the inseparable what had become of jean valjean
immediately after having laughed at cosette 's graceful command when noone was paying any heed to him jean valjean had risen and had gained the antechamber unperceived
this was the very room which eight months before he had entered black with mud with blood and powder bringing back the grandson to the grandfather
the old wainscoting was garland ed with foliage and flowers them us icia nswere seated on the sofa on which the yha dla id marius down
basque in a black coat knee breeches white stockings and white gloves was arranging roses round all of the dishes that were to be served
jean valjean pointed to his arm in its sling charged basque to explain his absence and went away
the long windows ofthe diningroom opened on the street
jean valjean stood for several minutes erect and motionless in the darkness beneath those radiant windows
he listened
the confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear
hehe ard the loud commanding to nes of the grandfather the violin sthe clatter of the plates the bursts of laughter and through all that merry uproar hedis ting uis he dc oset te 's sweet and joyous voice
he quit ted the rue de sfi lles ducal vair eand returned to the rue de l' homme arm e
inorder to return thither he took the rue saint louis the rue culture saint ecat her in eand the blanc sma nte aux it was alittle longer but it was the road through which forth elas tth re emo nth she had become accustomed to pass everyday on his way from the rue de l' homme arm et other ued esf illes ducal vair ein order to avoid the obstruction sand the mud in the rue vielle dut empl e
this road through which cosette had passed excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary
jean valjean entered his lodgings
he light ed his candle and mounted the stairs
the apartment was empty
event ous saint was nolonger the re
jean valjean 's step made more noise than usual in the chamber s
all the cupboard sst ood open
he penetrated to cosette 's bedroom
the re were no sheets on the bed
the pillow cover ed with ticking and without a case or lace was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress whose covering was visible and on which noone was ever to sleep again
all the little feminine objects which cosette was attached to had been carried away nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls
toussaint 's bed was despoiled in like manner
one bed only was made up and seemed to be waiting someone and this was jean valjean 's bed
jean valjean looked at the walls closed some of the cupboard doors and went and came from one room to another
the nhes ought his own chamber once more and set his candle on a table
he had disengaged his arm from the sling and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him
he approached his bed and his eyes rested was it by chance
was it intentionally
onthe inseparable of which cosette had been jealous on the little portmanteau which never left him
on his arrival in the rue de l' homme arm eon the tho fj une he had deposited it on around table near the head of his bed
he went to this table with a sort of vivacity to oka key from his pocket and opened the valise
from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which ten years before cosette had quitted mon tfe rme il first the little gown the nth ebla ckf ich uthe nthe stout coarse child 's shoes which cosette might almost have worn still so tiny were her feet then the fust ian bodice which was very thick then the knitted petticoat next the apron with pockets the nth ewo olle nst ock in gs
the sesto cking sw hich still preserved the graceful for mofa tiny leg were nolonger than jean valjean 's hand
all this was black of hue
it was he who had brought those garments to mont ferme il for her
asher emo ved the mfr omt he valise he laid the month ebe d
he fell to thinking
he called up memories
it was in winter in avery cold month of december she was shivering half naked in rags her poor little feet were all red inthe irw ood en shoes
he jean valjean had made her abandon those rags to clothe herself in the sem our ning habi lime nts
the mother must have felt please dinh erg rave to see her daughter wearing mourning for her and above all to see that she was properly clothed and that she was warm
he thought of that forest of mont ferme il they had traversed it together cosette and he he thought of what the weather had been ofthe leafless trees of the wood destitute of birds of the sunless sky it mattered not it was charming
hear range dthe tiny garments on the bed the fic hun ext to the petticoat the stockings beside the shoes and he looked at the mone after the other
she was not all erth an thats he had her big doll in her arms she had put her louis d'or in the pocket of that aprons he had laughed the yw al ked hand in hand she had no one in the world but him
the nhis venerable whitehead fell forward on the bed that stoical old heart broke his face was engulfed soto speak in cosette 's garments and if anyone had passed up the stairs at that moment he would have heard frightful so bs
chapter iv the immortal live rthe old and formidable struggle of which we have already witnessed soma ny phases began on cem or e
jacobs tru ggl ed with the angel but one night
alas
how many times have web ehe ld jean valjean seized bodily by his conscience in the darkness and struggling desperately against it
unheard of conflict
at certain moments the foot slips at other moments the ground crumbles away under foot
how many times had that conscience mad for the good clasped and overthrow nhi m
how many times had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast
how many times hurled to earth by the light had he begged for mercy
how many times had that implacable spark light ed within him and upon him by the bishop dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind
how many times had her is ent oh is feet in the combat held fast to the rock leaning against soph is mdr a gge dint he dust now getting the upper hand of his conscience again overthrown by it
how many times after an equiv oq uea fter the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism had he heard his irritated conscience cryin his ear at rip
you wretch
how many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat under the evidence of duty
resistance to go d
funereal sweats
what secret wounds which he alone felt bleed
what exco riat ions in his lamentable existence
how many times he had risen bleeding bruised broken enlightened despair in his heart serenity in his soul
and vanquished he had felt himself the conqueror
and after having dislocated broken and rent his conscience with red hot pincers it had said to him as it stood over him for mid able luminous and tranquil now goin peace
but one merging from some lan chol yac on flict what a lugubrious peace alas
nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat
ah ear trending question presented itself
predestination sare not all direct the yd on otop en out in astra ight avenue before the predestined manthey have blind court simp as sable all eys obscure turns disturbing crossroads of fering the choice of many ways
jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of the sec ross road s
he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil
he had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes
onthis occasion once more asha dha ppe ned to him already in other sad vicissitudes two roads opened out before him the one tempting the other alarming
which was he to take
he was counsel led to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness
once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush
is it then true
the soul may recover but not fate
frightful thing
an incurable destiny
this is the problem which presented itself to him in what manner was jean valjean to be have in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius
it was he who had willed that happiness it was he who had brought it about heh a dhi msel fbu ried it in his entrails and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armor erw ould experience on recognizing his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his own breast
cosette had marius marius possessed cosette
the yha devery thing even riches
and this was his doing
but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that it existed now that it was the re
should he force himself on this happiness
should he treat it as belonging to him
no doubt cosette did belong to another but should he jean valjean retain of cosette all that he could retain
should here main the sort of father half seen but respected which he had hitherto been
should he without saying a word bring his past to that future

good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point
what are you going to do

this habit of trial jean valjean possessed
he gazed in tently at the sphinx
he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects
cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck
what was he todo
to cling fast to it or to let go his hold
if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drip from his garments and his hair he was saved he should live
and if he let go his hold

thus he took sadc ouncil with his thoughts
or to speak more correctly he fought he kicked furiously internal lyn owa gains this will now against his conviction

onthe morning of the tho ffe bru ary it was alittle past midday when basque with napkin and feather duster under his arm busy in setting his antechamber to right shear dali ght tap at the door
the reha dbe enno ring which was discreet on such a day
basque opened the door and beheld m
fau che le vent
he introduced him into the drawing room still encumbered and to psy turvy and which bore the air of afield of battle after the joys of the preceding evening
dames irre marked basque we all woke up late
is your master up
asked jean valjean
how is monsieur 's arm
replied basque
better
is your master up
which one
the old one or the new one
monsieur pont mercy
monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up
amani saba ron most of all to his servants
he counts for something with the mthe yare what a philosopher would call be spattered with the title and that flatter sthe m
marius be its aid in passing a militant republican as he had proved was now aba ronin spite of himself
as mall revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title
it was now m
gillen or man dwh ocl ung to it and marius who detached himself from it
but colonel pont mercy had written myson will be army title
marius obeyed
and the ncos ette in whom the woman was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a baroness
monsieur le baron
repeated basque
iwill go and see
iwill tell him that m
fau che le vent is here
no
don otte ll him that it is i
tell him that someone wishes to speak to him in private and mention noname
ah
ejaculated basque
i wish to surprise him
ah
ejaculated basque once more emitting his second ah
as an explanation of the first
and he left the room
jean valjean remained alone
the drawing room as we have just said was in great disorder
it seemed as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding
onthe polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garland sand headdresses
the wax candles burn edt ost ump sad de dst ala c tites of wax to the crystal drop soft he chandeliers
not as in gle piece of furniture was in its place
in the corner sth re eor four armchairs drawn close together in a circle had the appearance of continuing acon versa tion
the whole effect was cheerful
acer tain grace still lingers round adea dfe as t
it has been a happy thing
onthe chairs in disarray among those fading flowers beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy
the sun had succeeded to the chandelier and made it sway gay lyin to the drawing room
several minutes elapsed
jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where basque had left him
he was very pale
his eyes were hollow and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that the yn early disappeared in the iro rbi ts
his black coat bore the weary folds of agar men tth at hasbeen up all night
the elbows were white ned with the down which the friction of cloth against line nle ave s behind it
jean valjean stared at the window outlined on the polished floor at his feet by the sun
the rec am eas ound at the door and her aise dhis eyes
marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant
he had not slept either
it is you father
he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air
but you have come to oea rly
it is only half past twelve
cosette is asleep
that word father said to m
fau che le vent by marius signified supreme felicity
the reha dal ways existed as the reader knows aloft yw all ac old ness and acon strain tbe tween the mice which must be broken or melted
marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m
fau che le vent was to him as to cosette afa the r
he continued his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms of joy
how glad i am to see you
if you only knew how we missed you yesterday
goodmorning father
how is your hand
better is it not
and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he pursued wehave both been talking about you
cosette love syo us ode arly
you must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to do with the rue de l' homme arm e
wewill have no more of it at all
how could you got olive in a street like that which is sick ly which is disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one is cold and into which one can not enter
you are to come and install your self here
and this very day
or you will have to deal with cosette
she means to lead us all bythe nose iwar ny ou
you have your own chamber here it is close to our sito penson the garden the trouble with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is allready you have only to take possession of it

i believe that the reis alittle valise to which you are attached ihave fixed upon acorn ero fh on or for that
you have conquered my grandfather you suit him

you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight ifyou play whist
it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the day sw he nia matt he courts you shall give her your army ouk now as you use dto in the luxembourg
we are absolutely resolved to be happy
and you shall be included in it in our happiness do you hear father
come will you breakfast with us today
sir said jean valjean ihave something to say to you
iam a nex convict
the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be over leaped aswell in the case of the mind as in that of the ear
the sew or dsi aman exco nvi ctp roce edin gfr omt he mouth of m
fau che le vent and entering the ear of marius over shot the possible
it seemed to him that something had just been said to him but he did not know what
he stood with his mouth wide open
the nhep erc eiv edt hat them an who was addressing him was frightful
wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not upto that moment observed the other man 's terrible pallor
jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm unrolled the line nfr omar ound his hand bare dhis thumb and showed it to marius
the reis nothing them at ter with my hands aid he
marius looked at the thumb
the reha snot been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean
the rewa sin fact not race of any injury
jean valjean continued itwas fitting that is hould be absent from your marriage
iabs ented myself as much as was in my power
so i invented this injury in order that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw in to the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing
marius stammered
what is the meaning of this
the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that ihave been in the galleys
you are driving me mad
exclaimed marius inter ror
monsieur pont mercy said jean valjean iwas nineteen years in the galleys
for the ft
the niwas condemned for life for the ftf or as econ do ffe nce
atthe present moment ihave broken my ban
in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist the evidence he was forced to give way
he began to understand and as always happens in such cases he understood to om uch
an inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flash edt hr ough him an idea which made him quiver traverse dhis mind
he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future
say all say all
he cried
you are cosette 's father
and here treated aco up leo fpa ces with a movement of indescribable horror
jean valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling
it is necessary that you should be lieve meher esi ral though our oath to other sma ynot be received in law
here he paused the nwi tha sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority head de dar tic ula tings low lya nde mph as izing the syllables
you will be lieve me
it he father of cosette
before god no
monsieur le baron pont mercy iam a peasant of favero lles
iearn edm yli ving by pruning trees
myname is not fau che le vent but jean valjean
iam not related to cosette
reassure you rse lf
marius stammered who will prove that tome
i
since it elly ous o
marius looked at the man
he was melancholy yet tranquil
no lie could proceed from such a calm
that which is icy is sincere
the truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb
i believe you said marius
jean valjean be nthis head as though taking note of this and continued what am i to cosette
apa sse rb y
ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence
ilove her itis true
one loves a child who mon eha sse en when very young being old ones elf
when one is old one feels oneself agra ndf at her towards all little children
you may its eem sto me suppose that ihave something which resembles a heart
she was an orphan
without either father or mother
she needed me
that is why i began to love her
children are so we akt hat the first come rev en aman like me can be cometh eirp rote ctor
ihave fulfilled this duty towards cosette
id on ott hink that so slight at hing can be called a good action but if it be a good action well say that ihave done it
register this attenuating circumstance
today cosette passes out of my life our two roads part
henceforth ican donot hing for her
she is madame pont mercy
her providence has changed
and cosette gains by the change
all is well
as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not mention the mtom ebu tif or esta lly our thought they are a deposit
how did that deposit come into my hands
what does that matter
ires to re the deposit
nothing more can be demanded of me
icom plete the restitution by announcing my true name
that concerns me
ihave areas on for desiring that you should know who iam
and jean valjean looked marius full inthe face
all that marius experience dwa stu mult uous and incoherent
certain gusts of destiny produce the sebi llow sino urso uls
wehave all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed we say the first thing sth at occur to us which are not always precisely those which should be said
the rear esu dde nre vela tions which one can not be a rand which intoxicate like baleful wine
marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal
but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this
who forces you to do so
you could have kept your secret to yourself
you are neither denounced nor tracked nor pursued
you have area son for wantonly making such a revelation
conclude
the reiss ome thing more
in what connection do you make this confession
what is your motive
my motive
replied jean valjean in a voice solo wand dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius
from what motive in fact has this convict just said ' iam a convict '
well yes
the motive is strange
it is out of honesty
stay the unfortunate point is that ihave at hrea din my heart which keeps me fast
it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid
all life falls in ruin around one on eres is ts
had ibe enable to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to go faraway is hould have been safe
i had only to go away the rear edi ligence sin the rue boul oy you are happy iam going
ihave tried to break that thread ihave jerked at it it would not break it or emy heart with it
the nis aid ' icann otl ive anywhere else than here
' imus tst a y
well yes you are right iam a fool why not simply remain here
you offer meacham be rint his house madame pont mercy is sincerely attached to meshes aid to the armchair 's tre tch out your arms to him ' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me is uit him we shall live together and take our meals in common is hall give cosette my arm
madame pont mercy excuse me it is a habit we shall have but one roof one table on efi re the same chimney corner in winter the same promenade in summer that is joy that is happiness that is everything
we shall live as one family
one family
at that word jean valjean became wild
he folded his arms glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss the reina nd his voice suddenly rose in thundering to nesa son efa mil y
no
i belong to no family
id on otb elong to your s
id on otb elong to any family of men
inhouse sw here people are among the mse lve siam superfluous
the rear efa mili esb utt here is not hing of the sort form e
iam a nun lucky wretch iam left outside
did ihave afa the rand mother
i almost doubt it
onthe day when i gave that child in marriage all came to an end
ihave seen her happy and that she is with a man who ms he loves and that the re exists here akin do ldm an aho use hold of two angels and all joys in that house and that it was well is a idt omy self ' enter thou not
' ico uld have lied it is true have deceived you all and remained monsieur fau che le vent
solon gas itwas for her ico uld lie but now it would be for myself and imus tno t
it was sufficient for me to hold my peace itis true and all would go on
you ask me what has forced me to speak
avery odd thing my conscience
to hold my peace was very easy however
ipass edt henig hti ntry in gtop ers uad em ys elf to it you questioned mean dwh at ihave just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it well yes ihave passed the night in all eg in grea sons to myself and iga vem ys elf very good reason sih avedon ewha tico uld
but there are two things in which ihave not succeeded in breaking the thread that holds me fixed riveted and sealed here bythe heart or in silencing someone who speaks softly to me when i am alone
that is why i have come hither to tell you everything this morning
everything or nearly everything
it is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself i keep that to myself
you know the essential points
so i have taken my mystery and have brought it to you
and ihave dis embo well edm ys ecre tbe for eyo urey es
it was not ares olution that was easy to take
is tru ggl eda lln ight long
ah
you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champ mathieu affair that by concealing myname iwas doing noone any injury that the name of fau che le vent had been given to me by fa uchel event himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to him and that i might assuredly keep it and that is hould be happy in that chamber which you offer me that is hould not be in any one 's way that is hould be in my own little corner and that while you would have cosette is hould have the idea that i was in the same house with her
each one of us would have had his share of happiness
if icon tinued to be monsieur fau che le vent that would arrange everything
yes with the exception of my soul
the rewa sjo ye very where upon my surface but the bottom of my soul remained black
it is not enough to be happy one must be content
thus is hould have remained monsieur fau che le vent thus is hould have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your expansion is hould have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full noonday is hould have had shadows thus without crying '' war e ' is hould have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside is hould have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who iwas you would drive me from it is hould have allowed myself to be served by domestic sw hoh a dthe yk now nwo uld have said ' how horrible
' is hould have to uche dyo uwi thm yel bow which you have a right to dislike is hould have filch ed your clasps of the hand
the re would have existed in your house adi vision of respect between venerable white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the rest when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself as trang erw ould have been present
is hould have been side by side with you in your existence having form yon lyca reno tto disa rra nget he cover of my dreadful pit
thus iad ead man should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings
is hould have condemned her to myself for ever
you and cosette and iwould have had all three of our heads in the green cap
does it not make you shudder
iam only the most crushed of men is hould have been the most monstrous of men
and is hould have committed that crime everyday
and is hould have had that face of night upon my visa gee very day
everyday
and is hould have communicated to you as hare in my taint everyday
everyday
to you my dear ly beloved my children to you my innocent creatures
is it nothing to hold on e 's peace
is it as imple matter to keep silence
no it is not simple
the reis as i lence which lies
and my lie and my fraud and my indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime is hould have drained drop by drop is hould have spit it out the nsw allowed it again is hould have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday and my ' goodmorning ' would have lied and my ' goodnight ' would have lied and is hould have slept on it is hould have eaten it with my bread and is hould have looked cosette in the face and is hould have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul and is hould have been an abominable villain
why should i do it
inorder to be happy
inorder to be happy
have it her ight to be happy
is tand outside of life sir
jean valjean paused
marius listened
such chains of ideas and of anguish escan not be interrupted
jean valjean lowered his voice once more but it was nolonger adul lvo ice itwas asin is ter voice
you ask why is peak
iam neither denounced nor pursued nor tracked you say
yes
iam denounced
yes
iam tracked
by whom
by myself
it is iw hobart hepa ssa get omy self and i drag myself and i push myself and i arrest myself and i execute myself and when one holds one self one is firmly held
and seizing a handful of his own coat by the nape of the neck and extending it towards marius do you see that fist
he continued
don't you think that it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it
well
conscience is another grasp
if one desires to be happy sir one must never understand duty for a sso on a son eha scom pre hende dit it is implacable
one would say that it punished you for comprehending it but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel god beside you
one has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is a tpe ace with himself
and with a poignant accent head de dmo nsi eur pont mercy this is not commonsense iam a nhon est man
it is by degrading myself in your eyes that i elevate myself in my own
this has happened to me once before but it was less painful the nit was a mere nothing
yes an honest man
is hould not be so if through my fault you had continued to esteem men owt hat you despise me iams o
ihave that fatality hanging over me that not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration that consideration humiliate sme and crushes mein ward lya ndi nord erth at ima yr espe ctm ys elf it is necessary that is hould be despised
the nist rai ght en up again
iam a galley slave who obey shi scons cience
iknow well that that is most improbable
but what would you have med oab out it
it is the fact
ihave entered into engagement swith myself i keep the m
the rear een counters which bind us there are chance sw hich involve us in duties
you see monsieur pont mercy various things have happened to me in the course of my life
again jean valjean paused swallowing his saliva with an effort as though his words had a bitter aftertaste and the nhe went on when one has such a horror hanging over one on eha snot the right to make others share it without the irk now ledge on eha snot the right to make the msl ipo veron e 's own precipice without the irp erc eiv in git one has not the right to let one 's red blouse drag upon the mone has no right to slyly encumber with one 's misery the happiness of other s
it is hideous to approach those who are healthy and to touch the mint he dark with one 's ulcer
inspite of the fact that fau che le vent lent me his name ihave nor ight to use it heco uld give it to me but i could not take it
aname is an i
you see sir that ihave thoughts ome what i have read alittle although i am a peasant and you see that i express myself properly
i understand things
ihave procured myself an education
well yes to abstract aname and to place on ese lf under it is dishonest
letters of the alphabet can be filch ed like a purse or a watch
to be a false signature in flesh and blood to be a living false key to enter the house of honest people by picking the irlo ck nevermore to look straightforward to forever eye askance to be infamous within the in o
no
no
no
no
it is better to suffer to bleed to weep to tear on e 's skin from the flesh with one 's nails to pass night swri thing in anguish to devour oneself body and soul
that is why i have just told you all this
wantonly as you say
he drew a painful breath and hurled this final word in days gone by ist olea loaf of bread in order to live today in order to live iwill not steal an ame
to live
interrupted marius
you do not need that name in order to live
ah
i understand the matter said jean valjean raising and lowering his head several times in succession
as i lence ensued
both held their peace each plunged in a gulf of thought s
marius was sitting near at able and resting the corner of his mouth on one of his fingers which was folded back
jean valjean was pacing to and fro
he paused before amir ror and remained motionless
the nast hough replying to some inward course of reasoning he said as he gazed at the mirror which he did not see while at present iam relieved
he took up his march again and walked to the other end of the drawing room
atthe moment when he turned round he perceived that marius was watching his walk
the nhes aid with an inexpressible intonation id rag my legal ittle
now you understand why
the nhe turned fully round towards marius and now sir imagine this ihave said nothing ihave remained monsieur fau che le vent ihave taken myplace in your house iam one of you iam in my chamber icom etob re ak fast in the morning in slippers in the evening all three of us goto the play iacc ompany madame pont mercy to the tuileries and to the place royale wear et oge the ryou think me your equal one fine day you are the rea ndia mthe re wear econ versi ng wear ela ugh in galla to nce you hear a voice shouting this name ' jean valjean
' and behold that terrible hand the police darts from the darkness and abruptly tears of fmy mask
again he paused marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder
jean valjean resume dwh at doy ousa yto that
marius 's ile ncea nswere dfor him
jean valjean continued you see that i am right in not holding my peace
be happy be in heaven bethea nge lofa nang ele xis tint he sun be content therewith and do not trouble yourself about the means which apo or damned wretch takes to open his breast and for ceh is duty to come forth you have before you sir a wretched man
marius slowly crossed the room and when he was quite close to jean valjean he offered the latter his hand
but marius was obliged to step up and take that hand which was not offered jean valjean let him have his own way and its eem edt omar ius that he pressed a hand of marble
my grandfather has friends said marius iwill procure your pardon
it is useless replied jean valjean
iam believe dto be dead and that suffices
the dead are not subject edt osu rv eil lance
the yare supposed to rot in peace
death is the same thing as pardon
and disengaging the hand which marius held head de dwi tha sort of inexorable dignity moreover the friend to whom i have recourse is the doing of my duty and in eed but one pardon that of my conscience
at that moment ado or at the other end of the drawing room opened gently halfway and in the opening cosette 's head appeared
the ysa won lyh ers we et face her hair was in charming disorder here yel ids were still swollen with sleep
she made the movement of a bird which thrust sits head out of its nest glance dfi rst at her husband then at jean valjean and cried to the mwi tha smiles otha tthe ys eem edt obe hold a smile at the heart of arose iwill wager that you are talking politics
how stupid that is instead of being with me
jean valjean shuddered
cosette

and passing resolutely through the doors he entered the drawing room
she was dressed in a voluminous white dress in gg own with a thousand fold sand large sleeves which starting from the neck fell to her feet

she contemplated herself from head to foot in along mirror the nex claimed in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy the rewa son cea king and a queen

jean valjean had not uttered a single word
cosette turned to him in the first place father iwan tyo uto come and embrace me
what do you mean by not saying anything in stead of taking my part
who gave me such a father as that
you must perceive that my family life is very unhappy
my husband beats me

jean valjean obeyed

and she left the room
two seconds later the door opened on cem or eher fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to the mia mve ryan gry indeed
the door closed again and the shadows descended on cem or e
it was a sth ough ara yof sunlight should have suddenly traverse dthe night without itself being conscious of it
marius made sure that the door was securely closed
poor cosette
he murmured when she finds out
at that word jean valjean trembl edin every limb
he fixed on marius abe wilder edey e
cosette
oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this
that is right
stay iha dno tth ought of that
one has the strength for one thing but not for another
sirico nj urey oui entreat now sir give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her
is it not enough that you should know it
ihave been able to say it myself without being forced to it ico uld have to ldi tto the universe to the whole world itwas all one to me
but she she does not know what it is it would terrify her
what a convict
we should be obliged to explain matters to her to say to her ' he is a man who has been in the galleys
's hesa wthe chain gang pass by one day
oh
my god
he dropped into an armchair and hid his face in his hands
his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping
silent tears terrible tears
the reiss ome thing of suffocation in the so b
he was seized with a sort of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmurs olo wth a this voices eem edt oiss uef rom fathomless depth so h
would that i could die

and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but for ced for the last hour to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually beholding the convicts up erp ose dbe for ehi sve rye yes upon m
fau che le vent overcome little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself marius added it is impossible that is hould not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have sofa it hf ull yand honestly remitted
that is an act of probity
it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you
fix the sum yourself its hall be counted out to you
don otf ear to set it very high
it hanky ous irre plied jean valjean gently
here maine dint hough tfor am omen tme chanical ly passing the tip of his forefinger across his thumbnail the nhe lifted up his voice all is nearly over
but one last thing remains for me
what is it
jean valjean struggle dwi th what seemed alas the sita tion and without voice without breath he stammered rather than said no wth a tyo uk now do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosette anymore
it hink that would be better replied marius cold ly
is hall never see her more murmured jean valjean
and he directed his steps towards the door
he laid his hand on the knob the latch yielded the door opened
jean valjean pushed it open fare nought opas sth rough stood motionless for a second the ncl ose dthe door again and turned to marius
he was nolonger pale he was livid
the re were nolonger any tears in his eyes but only as orto ftr a gic flame
his voice had regained astra nge composure
stay sir he said
if you will allow it iwill come to see her
ias sure you that i desire it greatly
if i had not care dto see cosette is hould not have made to you the confession that ihave made is hould have gone away but aside sired to remain in the place where cosette is an dto continue to see her iha dto tell you about it honestly
you follow my reasoning do you not
it is a matter easily understood
you see ihave had her with me for more than nine years
we live dfi rst in that hut on the boulevard the ninth econ vent the nne art he luxembourg
that was where you saw her for the first time
your eme mber her blue plus hha t
the nwe went to the quartier desi nva lide sw here there was a railing on agar dent her uep lumet
i live dina little backcourt yard when ceic ould hear her piano
that was my life
we never left eachother
that lasted for nine years and some months
iwas like her own father and she was my child
id on otk now whether you understand monsieur pont mercy but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to nolonger have anything would be hard
if you do not disapprove of it iwill come to see cosette from time to time
iwill not come often
iwill not remain long
you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little waiting room
onthe ground floor
ico uld enter perfectly well bythe backdoor but that might create surprise perhaps an dit would be better ithink for me to enter bythe usual door
truly siris hould like to see alittle more of cosette
as rarely as you please
put yourself in my place ihave nothing left but that
and the nwe must be cautious
if i nolonger come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be considered singular
what i can do bythe way is to come in the afternoon when night is beginning to fall
you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be waiting for you
you are kinds irs aid jean valjean
marius salute dj ean valjean happiness escorted despair to the door and the set women parted
chapter ii the obscurities which are vela tion can contain marius was quite upset
the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside who mhe had seen cosette was now explained to him
the rewa sso meth in gen igm at icab out that person of which his instinct had warned him
this enigma was the most hideous of disgrace sthe galleys
this m
fau che le vent was the convict jean valjean
to abruptly find such as ecre tint he midst of one 's happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in an esto ft urt led ove s
was the happiness of marius and cosette the nce for thc on dem ned to such an eigh borhood
was this ana ccom plished fact
did the acceptance of that man for map art of the marriage now consummated
was the reno thing to be done
had marius wedded the convict aswell
in vain may one becr owned with light and joy in vain may one taste the grand purple hour of life happy love such shocks would force event hear change linh is ecstasy event he demigod in his glory to shudder
as is always the case in changes of view of this nature marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself
had he been wanting in divination
had he been wanting in prudence
had he involuntarily dulled his wits
alittle perhaps
had he entered upon this love affair which had ended in his marriage to cosette without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surrounding s
head mitted it is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves that life amends us little by little head mitted the chimeric alan dvi sion ary side of his nature as orto fin ternal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes and invade sthe entire man to such a degree astor end erh im not hing more than a conscience bathed in a mist
wehave more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius ' individual it y
here called that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plume tdu ring those six or seven ecstatic weeks he had not even spoke to cosette of that drama in the go rbe a uh ove lw here the victim had taken up such as in gular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight
how hadith appen edt hath ehad not mentioned this to cosette
yet it was so near and so terrible
how had it come to pass that he had not even named the then a rdi ersa ndp articular lyon the day when he had encountered epon in e
he now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time
nevertheless he could account for it
here called his ben umb eds tate his intoxication with cosette love absorbing everything that catching away of eachother in to the ideal and perhaps also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul ava gue dull instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any part his agency in which he had kept secret and inwhich he could be neither narrator nor witness without being an accuser
moreover the sef eww eek shad been a flash of lightning the reha dbe enno time for anything except love
in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had to ldc oset tea bout the go rbe a uam bush even if he had discovered that jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius
would that have changed her cosette
would he have drawn back
would he have a dore dhe ran ythe less
would he have refrained from marrying her
no
the nth ere was nothing to regret not hing with which he need reproach himself
all was well
the reis ade it yfor those drunken men who are called love rs
marius blind had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his sight
love had bandaged his eyes in order to lead him whither
top arad is e
but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an infernal accompaniment
marius ' ancient estrangement towards this man towards this fau che le vent who had turned into jean valjean was a tpr ese nt mingled with horror
in this horror let us state the rewa sso me pity and even acer tains urp rise
this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that deposit
and what a deposit
six hundred thousand francs
he alone was in the secret of that deposit
he might have kept it all he had restored it all
moreover he had himself revealed his situation
nothing for ced him to this
if anyone learned who he was it was through himself
in this avowal the rewa sso meth in gmo retha nacc ept an ceo fhu milia tion there was acceptance of peril
for a condemned man amas kis not a mask it is a shelter
afa lse name is security and he had rejected that false name
he the galleys lave might have hidden himself for ever in an honest family he had with stood this temptation
and with what motive
through a conscientious scruple
he himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth
in short whatever this jean valjean might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening
the re existed some mysterious rehabilitation which had begun and to all appearances scruples had for along time already controlled this man
such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar nature s
an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul
jean valjean was sincere
this sincerity visible palpable irre fraga blee vide nt from the very grief that it caused him rendered in qui ries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had said
here for marius the rewa sastra nger ever salo fsi tuations
what breathed from m
fau che le vent
distrust
what did jean valjean inspire
confidence
in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck head mitted the active principle head mitted the passive principle and he tried to reach a balance
but all this went on asin astor m
marius while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean soto speak in the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist
the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession the sewer ego od
this produced alight ening of the cloud the nth ecl oud became black once more
trouble das were marius 'm emo ries as had owo fthe mret urn edt ohim
after all what was that adventure in the jon dre tte attic
why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a complaint
here marius found the answer
because that man was a fugitive from justice who had broken his ban
another question why had that man come to the barricade
for marius now once more distinctly beheld that recollection which had reappeared in his emotions like sympathetic in katt heap plication of heat
this man had been in the barricade
he had not fought the re
what had he cometh ere for
in the presence of this question aspect resp rang up and replied javert
marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean dragging the pinion ed javert out of the barricade and he still hear dbe hind the corner of the little rue monde to urth at frightful pistols hot
obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the galleys lave
the one was in the other 's way
jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of reve ngi nghi msel f
he had arrived late
he probably knew that javert was a prisoner the re
the corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good and those heart sare socon stitute dth at a criminal who is in the path of repentance maybe scrupulous in the matter of the fta nd unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance
jean valjean had killed javert
atleast that seemed to be evident
this was the final question to be sure but to this there was noreply
this question marius felt like pincers
how had it come to pass that jean valjean 's existence had elbowed that of cosette for solo nga period
what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man
are the re then chains for two which are forged on high
and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon
so acri mean dani nno cence can be roommates in the mysterious galleys of wretchedness
in that defiling of condemned persons which is called human destiny can two brows pass side by side the one ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal light ning
who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing of f
in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal
who could have bound the lamb to the wolf and what was still more incomprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb
for the wolf love dthe lamb for the fierce creature adored the feeble one for during the space of nine years the angel had had the monster asher point of support
cosette 's childhood and girlhood her advent in the daylight her virgin al growth towards life and light had been sheltered by that hideous devotion
here questions exfoliated soto speak into innumerable enigma sab yss es yawned at the bottom sofa by sses and marius could nolonger bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy
what was this man precipice
the old symbols of genesis are eternal inhuman society such as it now exists and until abroad erda ys hall effect achan gein it there will always be two men the ones up eri or the other subterranean the one which is according to good isabel the other which is according to evil is cain
what was this tender cain
what was this ruffian religious lya bso rbe dint head oration of a virgin watching over her rearing her guarding her dignify in ghe rand enveloping her impure as he was himself with purity
what was that cesspool which had venerated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it as in gles pot
what was this jean valjean educating cosette
what was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of astar from every shadow and from every cloud
that was jean valjean 's secret that was also god 's secret
in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled
the one in some sort reassured him as to the other
god was a svi sible in this affair as was jean valjean
god has his instruments
he makes use of the tool which he will s
he is not responsible to me n
do we know how god sets about the work
jean valjean had labored over cosette
he had to some extent made that soul
that was incontestable
well what the n
the work man was horrible but the work was admirable
god produces his miracles as seems good to him
he had constructed that charming cosette and he had employed jean valjean
it had please dhi mto choose this strange collaborator for himself
what account have we to demand of him
is this thefirst time that the dung heap has aided the spring to create the rose
marius made himself the sere plies and declared to himself that the yw ereg ood
he had not dare dto press jean valjean on all the point sw hich wehave justin dicated but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it
head or edco set teh epos sessed cosette cosette was splendid ly pure
that was sufficient for him
what enlightenment did he need
cosette was alight
does light require enlightenment
he had everything what more could he desire
all is not that enough
jean valjean 's personal affairs did not concern him
and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convulsively to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch iam not hing to cosette
ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence
jean valjean was a passerby
he had said so himself
well he had passed
whatever he was his part was finished
henceforth the re remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to cosette
cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her lover her husband her celestial male
cosette as she took her flight winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis jean valjean
in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved heal ways returned to acer tain horror for jean valjean
as a cred horror perhaps for a swe have just pointed out he felt a quid divin umi nth at man
but do what he would and seek what exten uation he would he was certainly forced to fallback upon this them an was a convict that is to say abe in gwh oh as not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the very low est run g
after the very last of men comes the convict
the convict is nolonger soto speak in the semblance of the living
the law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man
marius on penal questions still held to the inexorable system though he was a democrat and he entertained all the idea soft he law on the subject of those who mthe laws trikes
he had not yet accomplished all progress we admit
he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right
he had not examined and weighed the right which manta kest odis pose of the irrevocable and the irreparable
he was not shocked by the word vind ict e
he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written laws hould be followed by eternal suffering and he accepted as the process of civilization social damnation
he still stood at this point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was good and at bottom wholly for me do flat ent progress
in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive
he was a man reproved he was the convict
that word was for him like the sound of the trump on the day of judgment and after having reflected upon jean valjean for along time his final gesture had been to turn away his head
vader etro
marius if we must recognize and even in sist upon the fact while interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said you are confessing me had not nevertheless put to him two or three decisive questions
it was not that the yha dno tpr ese nte dthe msel vest oh is mind but that he had been afraid of the m
the jon dre tte attic
the barricade
javert
who knows where the sere vela tions would have stopped
jean valjean did not seem like a man who would drawback and who knows whether marius after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him back
has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjuncture sto stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have asked aquest ion
it is especially when one loves that one gives way to the see xhibit ions of cowardice
it is not wise to questions in ister situations to the last point particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with the m
what ater rib le light might have proceeded from the despairing explanation so fj ean valjean and who knows whether that hideous glare would not have darted for tha sfar as cosette
who knows whether as orto fin fern al glow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel
the spattering of alight ning flash is ofthe thunder also
fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflection sw hich give color
the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association
right lyo rw ron gly marius had been afraid
he already knew too much
he sought to dull his senses rather than to gain further light
in dismay he bore of fco set tein his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean
that man was the night the living and horrible night
how should he dare to see kthe bottom of it
it is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow
who knows what it sre ply will be
the dawn maybe blackened forever by it
in this state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to marius
he now almost reproached him self for not having put those formidable questions before which he had recoiled and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung
he felt that he was too good to ogen tle to owe a kif we must say the word
this weakness had led him to an imprudent concession
he had allowed himself to be touched
he had been in the wrong
he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean
jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he should have done and have free dhis house from that man
he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened blinded and carried him away
he was displeased with himself
what was he todo now
jean valjean 's visit swer epr of ound lyre pug nant to him
what was the use in having that man in his house
what did the man want
here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself
he had promised he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean valjean held his promise one must keep on e 's word event oac on vic tab ove all to a convict
still his first duty was to cosette
in short he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him
marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing from one to the other and moved by all of the m
hence arose apr of ound trouble
it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a talent and marius succeeded in doing it
however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was a scan did as a dove is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that aman can be towards cosette
all that marius had caught a glimpse of an dha dsu rmi sed was real
that sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily

basque who was perfectly respectful opened the door of the waiting room and said iwill go and inform madame
the room which jean valjean entered was a damp vaulted room on the ground floor which served as a cellar on occasion which opened on the street was paved with red square san dwa sba dly light ed by a grated window

two armchairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace
between the chair san old bedside rug which displayed more foundation thread than wool had been spread by way of a carpet
the chamber was lighted by the fire on the heart hand the twilight falling through the window
jean valjean was fatigue d

she was adorably lovely
but what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not herbeau ty but he rso ul

jean valjean caught himself up

cosette struck her tiny hands together

one really does not know what to say to things like that which are not commonsense

i always have loved my black corner

one can not see distinctly
it is abominable that it is to wish to be monsieur jean

and becoming suddenly serious she gazed in tently at jean valjean and added are you angry with me because i am happy
ingenuous ness sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep
this question which was simple for cosette was profound for jean valjean
cosette had meant to scratch and she lacerated
jean valjean turned pale
here maine dfor am omen twit hout replying the nwi than inexpressible intonation and speaking to himself he murmured her happiness was the object of my life
now god may sign my dismissal
cosette thou art happy my day is over
ah you have said thou to me
exclaimed cosette
and she sprang to his neck
jean valjean in bewilderment strained her wildly to his breast
it almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back
thanks father
said cosette
this enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for jean valjean
he gently remove dc oset te 's arms and took his hat
well
said cosette

pardon me
jean valjean quitted the room leaving cosette stupefied at this enigmatic alfa re well
chapter ii another step backwards on the following day at the same hour jean valjean came
cosette asked him no questions was nolonger astonished nolonger exclaimed that she was cold nolonger spoke of the drawing room she avoided saying either father or monsieur jean
she allowed herself to be addressed as you
she allowed herself to be called madame
only her joy had undergone a certain diminution
she would have been sad if sadness had been possible to her
it is probable that she had had with marius one of those conversations in which the beloved man says what he pleases explains nothing and satisfies the beloved woman
the curiosity of love rsd oes not extend very far beyond the irow nlo ve
the lower room had made alittle toilet
basque had suppressed the bottle sand nicolette the spiders
all the day sw hich followed brought jean valjean at the same hour
he came everyday because he had not the strength to take marius ' words otherwise than literally
marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when jean valjean came
the house grew accustomed to the novel ways of m

many weeks passed in this manner
an ew life gradually took possession of cosette the relations which marriage create svi sits the care of the house pleasure sgr eat matters
cosette 's pleasure swer en otc ost lyth eyc on sisted in one thing being with marius
the great occupation of her life was to go out with him to remain with him
it was for the majo yth at was always fresh to go out armin armin the face of the sun in the open street without hiding the mse lve sbe for ethe whole world both of the mco mpl et el ya lone
cosette had one vexation
toussaint could not get on with nicolette the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible and she went away
the grandfather was well marius argued acas eher eand the rea unt gillen or man dpe ace fully led that life aside which suffice dfor her beside the new household
jean valjean came everyday
the address as thou disappeared the youth emad amet he monsieur jean rendered him another person to cosette
the care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding
she became more and more gay and less and less tender
yet she still love dhi msi ncer elya nd he felt it
one day she said to him suddenly you use dto be my father you are nolonger my father you were my uncle you are nolonger my uncle you were monsieur fau che le vent you are jean

he still lived in the rue de l' homme arm ebe cause he could not make up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where cosette dwelt
at first he only remained a few minutes with cosette and the nwe nta way
little by little he acquired the habit of making his visit sles sbri ef
one would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of the day sw hich were lengthening hear rived earlier and departed later
one day cosette chance dto say father to him
afl as hof joy illuminated jean valjean 's melancholy old countenance
he caught her up say jean
ah
truly she replied with a burst of laughter monsieur jean
that is right said he
and he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes
chapter iii they recall the garden of the rue plume tth is was the last time
after that last flash of light complete extinction ensued
no more familiar it yno more goodmorning with a kiss nevermore that words opr of ound lys we et my father
he was a this own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happiness eso nea fter the other and he had this sorrow that after having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail
the eye eventually become sacc us to me dto the light of a cellar
in short its uffi ced for him to have an apparition of cosette everyday
his whole life was concentrated in that one hour
he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked to her of years gone by of her childhood of the convent of her little friends of those bygone days
one afternoon it was on one of those early days in april already warm and fresh them omen to fthe sun 's great gayety the garden sw hich surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking the hawthorn was on the point of budding a jewelled garni ture of gilly flowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones amid the grass the rewa sachar ming beginning of daisies and buttercup sthe white butterflies of the year were making the irf irst appearance the wind that minstrel of the eternal wedding was trying inthe trees the first notes of that grand aurora ls ymp hon yw hich the old poets called the spring tide marius said to cosette we said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the rue plume t

the yw ent to that garden and that house
the re they found themselves again there they forgot themselves
that evening at the usual hour jean valjean came to the rue de sfi lles ducal vair e
madame went out with monsieur and has not yet returned basques aid to him
he seated himself in silence and waited an hour
cosette did not return
he departed with drooping head
cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to the irg arden and so joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of nothing else on the morrow
she did not notice that she had not seen jean valjean
in what way did you got hit her
jean valjean asked her
on foot
and how did you return
in a hackney carriage
for sometime jean valjean had noticed the economic all if eled by the young people
he was troubled by it
marius ' economy was severe and that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean
he hazard eda query why do you not have a carriage of your own

cosette made noreply
jean valjean 's visit swer en ota bridge d
far from it
when it is the heart which is slipping on edo esn otha lton the downward slope
when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good
cosette out did him
jean valjean began again
the yw eren ever wear y
marius that word was inexhaustible those six letters contained volume s
in this manner jean valjean contrived to remain along time
it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side
it alleviate dhis wounds
it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce m
gillen or man dse nds met or emin dma dame lab aron net hat dinner is served
on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home
was the re then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the mind of marius
was jean valjean really a chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly
one day here maine dst ill longer than usual
onthe following day he observed that the rewa sno fire on the heart h
hello
he thought
no fire
and he furnished the explanation for himself
it is perfectly simple
it is april
the cold weather has ceased
heaven s
how cold it is here
exclaimed cosette when she entered
why no said jean valjean
was it you who told basque not to make a fire the n
yes since we are now in the month of may
but we have a fire until june
one is needed all the year in this cellar
it hough tth at a fire was unnecessary
that is exactly like one of your ideas
retorted cosette
onthe following day there was a fire
but the two armchairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door
what is the meaning of this
though tje an valjean
he went forth ear mcha irs and restore dthe mto the iro rd in a ry place near the heart h

he prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits
asher oset ota kehi sle avec oset tesa id to him my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday
what was it
he said to me ' cosette wehave an income of thirty thousand livres
twenty seven that you own and three that my grandfather gives me
' ire plied ' that makes thirty
' he went on ' would you have the courage to live on the three thousand
' ian swer ed ' yes on nothing
provided that it was with you
' and the nias ked ' why do you say that tome
' here plied ' iwan ted to know
' jean valjean found not a word to answer
cosette probably expected some explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence
he went back to the rue de l' homme arm ehe was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining dwelling
it was only after having a scen de dne arly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again
his mind was swarming with conjecture s
it was evident that marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that he feared some source that was not pure who knows
that he had even perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he hesitated before this suspicious for tune and was disinclined to take it as his own preferring that both he and cosette should remain poor rather than that the ys hould be rich with wealth that was not clean
moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door
onthe following day he underwent something like a shock one nter in gthe ground floor room
the armchair shad disappeared
the rewa snot asin gle chair of any sort
ah what 's this
exclaimed cosette as she entered noch air s
where are the armchair s
the yare nolonger here replied jean valjean
this is to om uch
jean valjean stammered it was i who told basque to remove the m
and your reason
ihave only a few minutes to stay today
abri efs tay is no reason for remaining standing
it hink that basque needed the chair sfor the drawing room
why
you have company this evening no doubt
we expect noone
jean valjean had not another word to say
cosette shrugged her shoulders
to have the chair scar ried of f
the other day you had the fire put out
how odd you are
adieu
murmured jean valjean
he did not say adieu cosette
but he had not the strength to say adieu madame
he went away utterly overwhelmed
this time he had understood
onthe following day he did not come
cosette only observed the fact in the evening
why said she monsieur jean has not been here to day
and she felt as light twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius
onthe following day he did not come
cosette paid no heed to this passed here veni ngan dsl ept well that night as usual and thought of it only when she woke
she was so happy
she speedily despatched nicolette to m
jean 's house to inquire whether he were ill and why he had not come on the previous evening
nicolette brought back there ply of m
jean that he was not ill
he was busy
he would come soon
as soon as he was able
moreover he was on the point of taking a little journey
madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time
the yw eren otto worry about him

nicolette one nter in gm
jean 's had repeated to him her mistress 've ry words
that madame had sent her to inquire why m

everyday he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the same trip but he nolonger completed it and perhaps without himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it
his whole countenance expressed this single idea what is the use
his eye was dim no more radiance

how content on eis
how all sufficient one finds it
how being in possession of the false object of life happiness one forgets the true object duty
let us say however that the reader would do wrong were he to blame marius
marius as we have explained before his marriage had put no questions to m
fau che le vent and since that time he had feared to put any to jean valjean
he had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn
he had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair
he had confined himself to gradually est ranging jean valjean from his house and to effacing him as much as possible from cosette 's mind
he had in a manner always placed himself between cosette and jean valjean sure that in this way she would not perceive north in kof the latter
it was more than effacement it was an eclipse
marius did what he considered necessary and just
he thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen and other sw hich will be seen later on forgetting rid of jean valjean without harshness but without weakness
chance having ordained that he should encounter in a case which he had argued afor mere mpl oye eof the laffitte establishment he had acquired mysterious information without seeking it which he had not been able it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard and out of consideration for jean valjean 's perilous position
he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to someone who mhe sought with all possible discretion
in the meanwhile he abstained from touching that money
as for cosette she had not been initiated into any of the ses ecre tsb uti two uld be harsh to condemn her also
the re existed between marius and her anal lpo we rfu lma gnet is mwh ich caused her to do instinctively and almost mechanical ly what marius wished
she was conscious of marius ' will inthe direction of monsieur jeans he conformed to it
her husband had not been obliged to say anything to hershey ield edt othe vague but clear pressure of his tacit intentions and obeyed blindly
her obedience in this instance consisted in notre member in gwh at marius for got
she was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this
without her knowing why herself and without his having any cause to accuse her of it hers oul had become so wholly her husband 's that that which was shrouded in gloom in marius 'm in dbe came over cast in her s
let us not got oof a rho we veri nw hatco ncer ns jean valjean this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial
she was rather heedless than forgetful
at bottom she was sincerely attached to the man who ms he had solo ngc all edhe rfa the rb uts he loved her husband still more dearly
this was what had some what disturbed the balance of her heart which leaned to one side only
it sometimes happen edt hatco set tes poke of jean valjean and expressed her surprise
the nma riu scal med her he is absent it hink
did not he say that he was setting out on a journey
that is true though tco set te
he had a habit of disappearing in this fashion
but not for solo ng
two or three times she despatched nicolette to inquire inthe rue de l' homme arm ewh ether m
jean had returned from his journey
jean valjean caused the answer not obe given
cosette asked nothing more since she had but one need one art hma riu s
let us also say that onthe irs ide cosette and marius had also been absent
the yha dbe ent over non
marius had taken cosette to his father 's grave
marius gradually won cosette away from jean valjean
cosette allowed it
moreover that which is called far too harshly in certain cases the ingratitude of children is not always at hing sodes erving of reproach as it is supposed
it is the ingratitude of nature
nature as we have elsewhere said looks before her
nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing
those who are departing are turned towards the shadows those who are arriving towards the light

the nno doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation he made an effort drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself
he put on his old working man 's clothes
ashen olo nger went out he had returned to the man dpr efe rre dthe m
he was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his forehead
since he had been alone he had placed his bed in the antechamber inorder to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible
he opened the valise and drew from it cosette 's outfit
he spread it out on his bed
the bishop 's candlestick swer ein the irp lace on the chimney piece
he took from a drawer two wax candles and put the mint he candlesticks

every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him and he was obliged to sit down
it was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it itwas the remnant of all movement possible to him it was life drained which flows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be renewed
the chair in to which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirrors of a tal for him so providential for marius in which he had read cosette 's reversed writing on the blotting book
he caught sight of himself in this mirror and did not recognize himself
he was eight yy ears old before marius 'm arri age he would have hardly been taken for fifty that year had counted for thirty
what he bore on his brow was nolonger the wrinkles of age itwas the mysterious mark of death
the hollow in gof that pitiless nail could be felt the re
his cheeks were pendulous the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it the corner so fhi smo uth drooped asin the mask which the ancient ssc ulp tured onto mbs
he gazed into space with an air of reproach one would have said that he was one of those grand tragic being sw hoh a vec aus et oco mpla in of someone
he was in that condition the last phase of dejection in which sorrow nolonger flows it is coagulated soto speak the reiss ome thing on the soul like a clot of despair
night had come
he laboriously dragged at able and the old armchair to the fireside and placed upon the table ape nso mein kand some paper
that done he had a fainting fit
when he recovered consciousness he was thirsty
as he could not lift the jug he tipped it over painfully towards his mouth and swallowed a draught
as neither the penn or the ink had been used for along time the point of the pen had curled up the ink had dried away he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink which he did not accomplish with out pausing and sitting down two or three times and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen
he wiped his brow from time to time
the nhe turned towards the bed and still seated for he could not stand he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects
the sec on temp lations last edf or hours which seemed minutes
all at once he shivered he felt that a child was taking possession of him here ste dhis elbows on the table which was illuminated by the bishop 's candles and took up the pen

he exclaimed with in himself lamentable cries heard by god alone all is over

at that moment there came a knock at the door
chapter iv abot tle of ink which only succeeded in whitening that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius left the table and was on the point of withdrawing to his study having a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber
cosette had taken the grandfather 's armand was strolling in the garden

nothing evokes a memory like an odor
marius recognized that tobacco
he looked at the superscript ion to monsieur monsieur le baron pommer ci

the recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing aswell

this signature was not false
it was merely a trifle abridged
moreover the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation
the certificate of origin was complete

after a start of surprise he underwent a feeling of happiness

the man who entered was an utter stranger to him
this man who was old moreover had a thick nose his chin swathed in a cravat green spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of english coachmen in high life

he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow
the first thing that struck the observer was that this person age 's coat which was too ample although carefully button ed had not been made for him

not for tool on gwh ich might have proved embarrassing for the villain
the change was on sight for a day or two at the rate of thirty sousa day by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible
this costume rw as called the change rthe pickpockets of paris had given him this name and knew him by no other
he had a tolerably complete wardrobe
the rags with which he tricked out people were almost probable
he had specialties and categories one ach nail of his shop hung asocial status thread bare and worn here the suit of a magistrate the re the outfit of a cure beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of areti red military man elsewhere the habi lime nts of amano flett ersa ndf urth eron the dress of asta tes man

hence adaptation sw hich were sometimes difficult and from which the change r 's clients extricated themselves as best they might
so much the worse for the exception s

this whole costume was if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were white ava gue button hole yawned at one of the elbows moreover one of the coat buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as the hand of the state sma nsh ould always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart its function was to conceal the absent button
if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor who mbas que had just shown in the state sma n ' s suit borrowed from the pick me down that shop ofthe change r
marius 'd is appointment on beholding another man than the one who mhe expected to see turned to the newcomer 's disadvantage
he surveyed him from head to foot while that person age made exaggerated bows and demanded in a curt to new hat do you want

demanded marius
the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat ages ture characteristic of the vulture and replied with an augmented smile
has not monsieur le baron perused my letter
the rewa sso met ruthin this
the fact is that the contents of the epistle had slipped marius 'm in d
he had seen the writing rather than read the letter
he could hardly recall it
but am omen tag oaf res hst art had been given him
he had not edt hat detail my spouse and my young lady
he fixed a penetrating glance onthe stranger
an examining judge could not have done the look better
he almost layin wait for him
he confined himself to reply in gstat ethe case precisely
the stranger in sert ed hist woh and sin both his fobs drew himself up with out straightening his dorsal column but scrutinizing marius in his turn with the green gaze of his spectacles
so be it monsieur le baron
iwill be precise
ihave as ecre tto sell to you

which concerns me

what is the secret
marius scrutinized the man more and more ashe listened to him
icom men ceg rat is said the stranger
you will see that i am interesting

monsieur le baron you have in your house at hie fan dana ssas sin
marius shuddered
in my house

the imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on an assassin and at hie f
remark monsieur le baron that i do not here speak of ancient deeds deeds of the past which have lapsed which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god
is peak of recent deeds of actual facts as still unknown to justice at this hour
icon tinue
this man has insinuated himself into your confidence and almost into your family under a false name
iam about to tell you his real name
and to tell it to you for nothing
iam listening
his name is jean valjean
iknow it
iam going to tell you equally for nothing who he is

he is an ex convict
iknow it
you know it since i have had the honor of telling you
no
i knew it before
marius ' cold to net hat double reply of iknow it his laconic is mwh ich was not favorable to dialogue stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger
he launched a furious glance onthe sly at marius which was instantly extinguished
rapid as it was this glance was ofthe kind which aman recognizes when he has once beheld it it did not escape marius
certain flashes canon ly proceed from certain souls the eye that vent hole of the thought glows with its pect acle shi den othing try putting a pane of glass over hell
the stranger resume dwi tha smile iwill not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron
in any case you ought to perceive that i am well informed
now what i have to tell you is known to myself alone
this concern sthe fortune of madame la baronne
it is an extraordinary secret

he exclaimed but i must dine today nevertheless
it is an extraordinary secret it elly ou

marius gazed in tently at him iknow your extraordinary secret just as i knew jean valjean 's name just as iknow your name

that is not difficult monsieur le baron
i had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you

the nardi er
who 's that
in danger the porcupine bristles up the beetle feigns death the old guard for msi nas quare this man burst into laughter
the nhe flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip
marius continued you are also jon dre tte the work man faba nto uthe comedian gen flot the poet donal var est he spaniard and mistress bali zar d
mistress what
and you kept a pot house at mont ferme il
apo th ouse

and that you are a rascal
here
and marius drew a banknote from his pocket and flung it in his face
thanks
pardon me
five hundred francs
monsieur le baron
and the man overcome bowed seized the note and examined it
five hundred francs
he began again taken aback
and he stammered in a low voice an honest rustler
the nbr us que ly well so be it
he exclaimed
let us put ourselves at our ease
and with the agility of amon key flinging back his hair tearing off his spectacles and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made and which the reader has also met with onan other page of this book he took off his face as the man takes off his hat
his eye light edu phi sun even brow with hollow sins ome places and bumps in other shi de ously wrinkled at the top was laid bare his nose had become a ssh arpa sabe a kthe fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared
monsieur le baron is infallible he said in a clear voice when cea lln as a ltw an gha ddi sapp eared iam the nardi er
and hestra ight ened up his crooked back
the nardi erf or it was really he was strangely surprised he would have been troubled had he been capable of such a thing
he had come to bring astonishment and it was he who had received it
this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he accepted it but he was nonetheless bewildered
he beheld this baron pont mercy for the first time and inspite of his disguise this baron pont mercy recognized him and recognized him thoroughly
and not only was this baron perfectly informed as to the nardi erb uthe seemed well posted as to jean valjean
who was this almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew people 's name sw hok new allthe irna mesa nd who opened his purse to the mwh obu lli edra scal slike a judge and who paid the mli kea dupe
the nardi erth ereader will remember although he had been marius ' neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had formerly in a vague way heard his daughter stalk of avery poor young man named marius who lived in the house
he had written to him without knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted
no connection between that marius and m
lebaron pont mercy was possible in his mind
as for the name pont mercy it will be recalled that onthe battlefield of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks
however through his daughter az elma who had started on the scent of the married pair on the tho ffe bru aryan dth rough his own personal research esh ehad succeeded in learning many things and from the depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious clew
he had discovered by dint of industry or atleast by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on acer tain day in the grand sewer
from the man he had easily reached the name
he knew that madame la baronne pont mercy was cosette
but he meant to be discreet in that quarter
who was cosette
he did not know exactly himself
he did indeed catch a nin kling of illegitimacy the history of fantin ehad always seemed to him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that
inorder to cause himself to be paid for his silence
he had ortho ugh the had better wares than that for sale
and according to all appearances if he were to come and make to the baron pont mercy this revelation and without proof your wife is a bastard the only result would be to attract the boot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer
from the nardi er 's point of view the conversation with marius had not yet begun
he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs in his pocket
moreover he had something decisive to say and even against this very well informed and well armed baron pont mercy he felt himself strong
for men of the nardi er 's nature every dialogue is a combat
in the one in which he was about to engage what was his situation
he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner for cesa nda fter having said iam the nardi erh ewa it ed
marius had become thoughtful
so he had hold of the nardi era tlas t
that man who mhe had so great lyde sired to find was before him
he could honor colonel pont mercy 's recommendation
he felt humiliated that that he rosho uld have owned anything to this villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him marius had been protested upto that day
it also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards the nardi erth at the rewa so ccas ion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal
in any case he was content
he was about to deliver the colonel 's shade from this unworthy credit or atlas tandi tse emed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father 's memory from the debtors ' prison
by the side of this duty there was another to elucidate if possible the source of cosette 's fortune
the opportunity appeared to present itself
perhaps the nardi erk news ome thing
it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man
he commenced with this
the nardi erh adc aus ed the honest rustler to disappear in his fob and was gazing at marius with agent lene sst hat was almost tender
marius broke the silence
the nardi eri have to ldy ou your name
now would you like to have met elly ou your secret the one that you came here to reveal to me

in acer taina rro ndis semen to fthe pas de calais the rewa sin aman who had fallen out with justice and who under the name of m

this man had become a just man in the full force of the term
in a trade them an ufa ctu re of black glass goods hema de the fortune of an entire city
as far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some sort by accident
he was the foster father of the poor
he founded hospitals opened schools visited the sick dower ed young girls support ed widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of the country
here fused the cross he was appointed mayor
ali berated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days he denounced him and had him arrested and profit ed by the arrest to come to paris and cause the bank erl aff it tei have the fact from the cashier himself by means of a false signature to handover to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m

this convict who robbed m

as for the other fact you have nothing to tell me about it either
jean valjean killed the agent javert he shot him with a pistol
it hep erson who is speaking to you was present
the nardi erc as tup on marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just regained in one instant all the ground which he has lost
but the smile returned instantly

this is the first he did not rob m

he had evidence acer tain date irre fraga ble proof these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up the nardi er 's statement sthe not eprint edin the moniteur had been an administrative communication from the prefecture of police
marius could not doubt
the information ofthe cashier clerk had been false and he himself had been deceived
jean valjean who had suddenly grown grand emerged from his cloud
marius could not repress a cry of joy
well then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man
the whole of that fortune really belong edt ohim
he is made lein ethe providence of a whole country side
he is jean valjean javert 's savior
he is a hero
he is a saint
he 's not as a intan dhe 's not a hero

he'sa nass as sinan dar obb er
and head de dint he tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority let us be calm
robber assassin those words which marius thought had disappeared and which returned fell upon him like an ice cold shower bath
again
said he
always ejaculated the nardi er
jean valjean did not rob madeleine but he is a thief
he did not kill javert but he is a murderer
will you speak retorted marius of that miserable the ftc ommitted for ty years ago and expiate das your own newspaper spro veb yaw hole life of repentance of self abnegation and of virtue
is a yass as sin ation and the ftm on sieur lebaron and ire peat that i am speaking of actual facts
what i have to reveal to you is absolutely unknown
it belongs to unpublished matter
and perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortunes os kil fully present edt omada mela baronne by jean valjean
is a ys kil fully because by a gift of that nature it would not be so very un skilful to slip into an honorable house whose comfort son ewo uld the nsh are and atthe same stroke to conceal one 's crime and to enjoy one 's the ftt obu ryon e 's name and to create for oneself afam il y
i might interrupt you at this point said marius but goon
monsieur le baron iwill tell you all leaving the recompense to your generosity
this secret is worth massive gold
you will say to me ' why do not you apply to jean valjean
' for avery simple reason iknow that he has stripped himself and stripped himself in your favor and icons ide rthe combination ingenious but he has no longer as on he would show me his empty hands and since i am in need of some money for my trip to lajo yai prefer you you who have it all to him who has nothing
iam a little fatigue dpe rmit met ota keach air
marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same
the nardi erin stalled himself on a tufted chair picked up his two newspapers thrust the mba ckin to the ire nve lope and murmured as he pecked at the drapeau blanc with his nail it cost me ago odd eal of trouble to get this one
that done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying the nhe entered upon his subject gravely emphasizing his words monsieur le baron on the tho fj une about a year ago on the day of the insurrection aman was in the grand sewer of paris at the point where the sewer enter sthe seine between the pont de sin valid esa ndt he pont de jena
marius abruptly drew his chair close rto that of the nardi er
the nardi erno tice dth is movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words this man for ced to conceal himself and for reasons moreover which are foreign top olit ics had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it
it was ire peat on the tho fj une it might have been eight o'clock in the evening
the man hears a noise in the sewer
great lys urp rise dhe hide shims elf and lies in wait
it was the sound of footsteps someone was walking in the dark and coming in his direction
strange to say there was another man in the sewer besides himself
the grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off
alittle light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer and to see that the man was carrying something on his back
he was walking in a bent attitude
the man who was walking in a bent attitude was an ex convict and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse
assassination caught in the very act if ever there was such a thing
as for the theft that is understood one does not kill a man gratis
this convict was on his way to fling the body into the river
one fact is to be noticed that before reaching the exit grating this convict who had come along distance in the sewer must necessarily have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body but the sewer men would have found the assassinated man the very next day while at work on the quagmire and that did not suit the assassin 's plans
he had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden and his exertions must have been terrible for it is impossible to risk one 's life more complete ly id on ' tunde rst and how he could have come out of that alive
marius ' chair approach eds till nearer
the nardi ert ook advantage of this to draw along breath
he went on monsieur le baron as ewer is not the champ de mar s
one lacks everything there even room
when two men are the re they must meet
that is what happened
the man domiciled the rea ndt hepa sse rb yw ere for ced to bid eachother good day greatly to the regret of both
the passerby said to the inhabitant you see what i have on my back imus tge to ut you have the key give it to me
that convict was a man of terrible strength
the rewa snow ayo fref using
nevertheless the man who had the key parley eds imply to gain time
he examined the dead man but he could see nothing except that the latter was young well dressed with the air of being rich and all disfigured with blood
while talking the man contrived to tear and pull off behind without the assassin perceiving it abit of the assassinated man 's coat
adoc ument for conviction you understand am ean so frec over in gthe trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal
he put this document for conviction in his pocket
after which he opened the grating made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back closed the grating again and ran off not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man in to the river
now you comprehend
the man who was carrying the corpse was jean valjean the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment and the piece of the coat
the nardi erco mpl et ed his phrase by drawing from his pocket and holding on a level with his eyes nipped between his two thumbs and his two forefinger sastri po ftor nbl ack cloth all covered with dark spots
marius had sprung to his feet pale hardly able to draw his breath with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth and without uttering a word without taking his eyes from that fragment here treated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock of a cupboard near the chimney
he found the key opened the cupboard plunged his arm into it without looking and without his frightened gaze quitting the rag which the nardi erst ill held out spread
but the nardi erco nti nued monsieur le baron ihave the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by jean valjean and the bearer of an enormous sum of money
the young man was myself and here is the coat
cried marius and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood
the nsna tch in gthe fragment from the hands of the nardi erh ecr ouch edd own over the coat and laid the torn morse laga in stth etat tered skirt
the rent fitted exactly and the strip completed the coat
the nardi erw as petrified
this is what he thought i 'm struck all of a heap
marius rose to his feet trembling despairing radiant
he fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to the nardi erp resenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with banknotes for five hundred and at hous and francs
you are an infamous wretch
you are alia racal umn iat or avilla in

replied the nardi erb owing to the very earth eternal gratitude
and the nardi erle ftth eroom understanding nothing stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank bills
struck by lightning he was but he was also content and he would have been greatly angered had he had a lightning rod toward of fsu chl ight ning as that
let us finish with this man at once
two days after the event sw hich wear eat this moment narrating he set out thanks to marius ' care for america under a false name with his daughter az elma furnished with a draft on newyork for twenty thousand francs
the moral wretchedness of the nardi erth ebo urge ois who had missed his vocation was irremediable
he was in america what he had been in europe

said he
marius was bewildered
he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure
an unheard of virtues up reme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him
the convict was transfigured into christ
marius was dazzled by this prodigy
he did not know precisely what he beheld but it was grand
in an instant aha ck ney carriage stood in front of the door

and seating herself on the old man 's knees she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement and kissed his brow

cosette who only understood in avery confused manner redoubled her caresses as though she desired to pay marius 'd ebt
jean valjean stammered how stupid people are

he murmured the proof that god is good is that she is here
father
said cosette
jean valjean continued it is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together
the irt rees are full of birds
iwould walk with cosette
it is sweet to be among living people who bid eachother ' good day ' who call to eachother in the garden
people see eachother from early morning
we should each cultivate our own little corner
she would make me eather strawberries
iwould make her gather my roses
that would be charming

marius stepped up to the doctor
headdress edt ohim only this single word monsieur
but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question
the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance
because things are not agree able said jean valjean that is no reason for being unjust to ward sgod
as i lence ensued
all breasts were oppressed
jean valjean turned to cosette
he began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity
in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at cosette
the reflection of that sweet face light edu phi spa levis age
the doctor felt of his pulse
ah
it was youth at hew an ted
he murmured looking at cosette and marius
and bending down to marius ' ear head de dina very low voice to olate
jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without ceasing to gaze at cosette
the seba rely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth it is not hing to die itis dreadful not to live
all at once he rose to his feet

he walked with a firm step to the wall thrusting aside marius and the doctor who tried to help him detached from the wall alittle copper crucifix which was suspended the rea ndr et urn edt oh is seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health and said in aloud voice as he laid the crucifix on the table behold the great martyr
the nhis chest san kinh is head wavered as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him
his hands which rested on his knees began to press the irna ilsi ntot he stuff of his trousers
cosette support ed his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him but could not

is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again
it might be said that agony writhes
it goes comes advance stow ards the sepulchre and return stow ards life
the reis groping in the action of dying
jean valjean rallied after this semi swoons hook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more
he took a fold of cosette 's sleeve and kissed it
he is coming back
doctor he is coming back cried marius
you are good both of you said jean valjean
iam going to tell you what has caused me pain

the doctor dismissed her
but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared would you like a priest
ihave had one replied jean valjean
and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw someone
it is probable infact that the bishop was present at this death agony
cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins
jean valjean resume dha veno fear monsieur pont mercy iad jure you

when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back

letter to m
daelli publisher of the italian translation of les miserables in milan
haute ville house october
you are right sir when you tell me that les miserables is written for all nations
id on otk now whether it will be read by all but i wrote it for all
it is addressed to england aswell as to spain to italy aswell as to france to germany aswell as to ireland to republics which have slaves as well as to empires which have serfs
social problems over step frontiers
the sores of the human race those great sores which cover the globe donot halt at the red or blueline strace dupont he map
in every place where man is ignorant and despairing in every place where woman is sold for bread wherever the child suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and ofthe heart hwh ich should warm him the book of les miserables knocks at the door and says open to me icom efor you
atthe hour of civilization through which we are now passing and which is still so sombre the miserable 's name is man he is agonizing in all climes and he is groaning in all languages
your italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our france
your admirable italy has all miseries on the face of it
does not bandit is mth at raging for mof pauperis minha bit your mountains
few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convent sw hich ihave endeavored to fathom
inspite of your possessing rome milan naples palermo turin florence sienna pisa mantua bologna ferrara genoa venice aher oic history sublime ruins magnificent ruins and superb cities you are like ourselves poor
you are covered with marvel sand vermin
assuredly the sun of italy is splendid but alas azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man
like us youhave prejudice ssu per sti tions tyrannies fanaticism sbl in dla wsl ending assistance to ignorant custom s
you taste nothing of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it
you have a barbarian the monk and as a vag ethel azzaro ne
the social question is the same for you as for us
the rear eafe wless death sfr omh unger with you and a few more from fever your social hygiene is not much better than ours shadows which are protestant in england are catholic inital yb utu nder different names the vesco vois identical with the bishop and it always means night and of pretty nearly the same quality
to explain the bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the gospel badly
is it necessary to emphasize this
must this melancholy parallelism be yet more complete ly verified
have you not indigent persons
glance below
have you not parasites
glance up
does not that hideous balance whose two scales pauperis man dpa ras it is mso mournfully preserve the irm utu ale qui librium oscillate before you as it does before us
where is your army of school master sthe only army which civilization acknowledges
where are you rfr eea ndc omp uls or ysch ools
does everyone know how to read in the land of dante and of michaelangelo
have you made public schools of your barracks
have you not like ourselves an opulent war budget and a paltry budget of education
have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldier lyo be die nce
military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of firing up on garibaldi that is to say upon the living honor of italy
let us subject your social order to examination let us take it where it stands and as it stands let us view its flagrant offences show me the woman and the child
it is bythe amount of protection with which the set wof eeb lec re atures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to be measured
is prostitution less heartrending in naples than in paris
what is the amount of truth that springs from your laws and what amount of justice springs from your tribunal s
do you chance to be sofort una teas to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words public prosecution legal infamy prison the scaffold the execution erth edea th penalty
italian swith you as with us beccaria is dead and farina ceis alive
and the nle tuss crut in ize your state reasons
have you ago vern men twh ich comprehend sthe identity of morality and politics
you have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes
something very similar has been done in france
stay let us pass miseries inreview let each one contribute his pile you are as rich as we
have you not like ourselves two condemnation sre ligi ous condemnation pronounced by the priest and social condemnation decreed by the judge
oh great nation of italy thou resembles tthe great nation of france
alas
our brothers you are like ourselves miserable s
from the depths of the gloom where in you dwell you do not seem uch more distinctly than wether adia nta nd distant portal so fed en
only the priests are mistaken
the seh oly portal sare before and not be hindus
ires ume
this book les miserables is no less your mirror than ours
certain men certain castes rise in revolt against this book iun derstand that
mirrors those reveal ers of the truth are hated that does not prevent the mfr omb ein go fuse
as for myself ihave written for all with a profound love for my own country but without being engrossed by france more than by any other nation
in proportion as i advance in life igr owm or esi mpl eand ibec ome more and more patriotic for humanity
this is more overt he tendency of our age and the law of radiance of the french revolution books must cease to be exclusively french italian german spanish or english and become european isa ym or eh umani fthe yare to correspond to the enlargement of civilization
hence an ew logic of art and of certain requirements of composition which modify everything event he conditions for me rly narrow of taste and language which must grow broader like all the rest
in france certain critics have reproached met omy great delight with having transgressed the bounds of what they call french taste is hould be glad i ft his eu log ium were merited
in short iam doing what i can i suffer with the same universal suffering and it ryt oas sua gei tipos sesso nly the puny for ces of amana ndi cry to all help me
this siris what you rle tter prompts me to say is a yit for you and for your country
if i have insisted so strongly it is because of one phrase in your letter
you write the rear eit alia nsa ndt hey are numerous who say ' this book les miserables is a french book
it does not concern us
let the french read it as a history were a dita saro man ce
' alas
ire peat whether we be italian so rfr en chm en misery concerns usa ll
ever since history has been written ever since philosophy has meditated misery has been the garment of the human race the moment has a tlen gth arrived for tearing off that ragan dfor replacing upon the naked limbs of the man people the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn
if this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and in dissipating some prejudice syo uar eat liberty to publish it sir
accept ipra yy oua renewed assurance of my very distinguished sentiments

iwas evidently expected for when i got near the door iface dach eery looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress white undergarment with a long double apron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty
when i came close she bowed and said the herren glish man
yes is a idj on a thanh ark er
she smiled and gave some message to an elderly man in white shirt sleeves who had followed her to the door
he went but immediately returned with a letter my friend
welcome to the carpathians
iam anxiously expecting you

at three tomorrow the diligence will start for bukovina aplac eon it is kept for you
atthe borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me

your friend dracula
may ifo und that my landlord had got a letter from the count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to details hese emed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my german
this could not be true because upto the nhe had understood it perfectly atleast he answered my question sex act lya sif he did
he and his wife the old lady who had received melo ok eda teach other in a frightened sort of way
he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew
when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed the mse lve sands ayin gth at the yk new nothing at all simply refused to speak further
it was so near the time of starting that i had not imet oas kanyon eels efor it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting
just before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a hysterical way must you go
oh
young her rmu st you go
she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all
iwas just able to follow her by asking many questions
when it old hertha tim us tgo at once and that i was engaged on important business shea sked again do you know what day it is

she shook her head as she said again oh yes

on my saying that i did not understand she went on it is the eve of st
george 's day
do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full sway
do you know where you are going and what you are going to
she was in such evident distress that it ried to comfort her but without effect
finally she went down on her knees and implored men otto goat least to wait a day or two before starting
it was all very ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable
however there was business to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it
it ried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that it hank edhe rb utm yd ut yw as imperative and that i must go
she then rose and dried here yes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me
id id not know what to do for a sane nglish church man ihave been taught to regards uch things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning sowell and in such as tate of mind
she saw is up pose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said for your mother 's sake and went out of the room
iam writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach which is ofcourse late and the crucifix is still round my neck
whether it is the old lady 's fear or the many ghostly traditions of this place or the crucifix itself id on otk now but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual

and he crossed himself reverently
as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us

onthis were sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the cs zek swith the ir white and the slovak swith the irc olo ured sheepskin sthe latter carrying lance fashion their long staves with a xe at end
as the evening fell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark mist in ess the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valley sw hich randee pbe tween the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark firs stood out here and the rea gains tthe background of late lying snow
sometimes as the road was cut through the pinewood sth at seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of grey ness which he rea ndt here best re wed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and grim fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost like clouds which amongst the carpathians see mto wind ceaselessly through the valley s
sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our driver 's haste the horses could only go slowly

and the nhe added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasant ry for helo ok ed round to catch the approving smile of the rest and you may have enough of such matters before you got os lee p
the only stop he would make was a moment 's pause to light his lamps
when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement among stth epass enger sand they kept speaking to him on eaf tert he other as though urging him to further speed

the road grew more level and we appeared to fly along

the nasw efl ewa long the driver leaned forward and one achs ide the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness
it was evident that something very exciting was either happening or expected but though i asked each passenger noone would give me the slightest explanation
this state of excitement kept on for some little time
and atlas twe saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side
the re were dark rolling clouds over head and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder
it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmosphere sand that now we had got into the thunderous one
iwas now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count
each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark
the only light was the flickering rays of our own lamps in which the steam from our harddrive nh or ses rose in a white cloud
we could see now the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it nosig no fave hicle
the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment

to which the stranger replied that is why is up posey ou wished him to go on to bukovina

one of my companions whispered to another the line from burger 's lenore

the strange driver evidently he ard the words for helo ok edu pwi tha gleaming smile
the passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself

the nide scen de df rom the side of the coach as the caleche was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel
his strength must have been prodigious
without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the pass

the carriage went at a hard pace straight along the nwe made a complete turn and went along another straight road
it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so it ook not eof some salient point and found that this was so
iwould have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but i really feared to do so for it hough tth at placed as iwasa ny protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay
by and by however as i was curious to know how time was passing is truck am at chan dby its flame looked at my watch

this time after going to the farside of the pass he suddenly turned down an arrow roadway which ran sharply to the right
soon we were hemmed in with trees which inplace sarch edri ght over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel
and again great frowning rocks guarded usb old lyon either side
though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along
it grew colder and colder still and fine powder ysn owb egan to fall so that soon we and all around us were covered with a white blanket
the keen winds till carried the howling of the dogs thought his grew fainter as we went on our way
the baying of the wolves sounded nearer and nearer as though the yw erec losing round on us from every side
igre wdr ead fully afraid and the horses shared my fear
the driver however was not in the least disturbed
he kept turning his head to left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness
suddenly away on our left is a wafa in tfl icke ring blue flame
the driver saw it at the same moment
heaton cech ecke dthe horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness
id id not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer

once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us ico uld watch the driver 's motion s

this startled me but as the effect was only momentary it ook it that my eyes deceived me straining through the darkness
the nfor at imet here were no blue flames and we sped on wards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though the yw ere following in a moving circle
atlas tthe re came at ime when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright
ico uld not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether
but just the nth emo on sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a beet ling pine clad rock and by its light is a war ound usa ring of wolves with white teeth and lolling red tongue swith long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair

ashes we pth is long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still
just the nahe a vy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness
when i could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche and the wolves disappeared
this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon mean diwa safra id to speak or move
the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon
we kept on ascending with occasional period so fq uic kde scent but in the main always ascending
suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of avast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came nora yof light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the sky

in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark ways led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is
ihave not yet been able to see it by daylight
when the caleche stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to alight
again i could not but not ice his prodigious strength
his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen
the nhe to ok my traps and placed the month eg round beside me as is to odc lose to agreat door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a project in gdo or way of massive stone
ico uld see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather

the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down on eof the dark opening s

through the sef row ning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate
the time iwai ted seemed endless and if elt doubts and fears crowding upon me
what sort of place had icom et oanda mon gwh at kind of people
what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked
was this acu stoma ry incident in the life of a solicitor 's clerks ent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to afore ign er
solicitor 's clerk

i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake
it all seemed like a horrible nightmare to mean die xp ected that is hould suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had no wanda gain felt in the morning after a day of overwork
but my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived
iwas indeed awake and among the carpathians
all ico uld do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of morning
just as i had come to this conclusion ihe arda heavy step approach in gbe hind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light
the nth ere was the sound of rattling chains and the clanking of massive bolts drawn back

the old man motion edme in with his right hand with a court ly gestures ayin gine xcel lenten glish but with a strange intonation
welcome to my house
enter free lya nd of your own free will
he made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone
the instant however that i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me wince an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed cold as ice more like the hand of a dead than a living man
again he said welcome to my house
enter free ly
go safely and leaves ome thing of the happiness you bring
the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver whose face iha dno tse ent hat for a moment i doubt edif it were not the same person to whom i was speaking
so to make sure is a idi nter rog atively count dracula
he bowed in a court ly way as he replied iam dracula and ibid you welcome mr

as he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out to ok my luggage
he had carried it in before i could forest all him
ipro tested but he insisted
nays ir you are my guest
it is late and my people are not available
let me see to your comfort myself
he insisted on carrying my traps along the passage and the nup agreat winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily

the count halted putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by asin gle lamp and seemingly without a window of any sort
passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter
it was a welcome sight
for her ewa sag re atb ed room well lighted and warmed with another log fire also added to but lately for the top logs were fresh which sent a hollow roar up the wide chimney
the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door
you will need after you rj our ney to refresh yourself by making your toilet

when you are ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepared
the light and warmth and the count 's courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears

he is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service
he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters
the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a dish and if ell to a ton ceo nan excellent roast chicken
this with some cheese and as a lada nda bottle of old to kayo fw hich iha dtw ogl asses was my supper
during the time iwas eating it the count as ked me many questions as to my journey and it old him by degrees all iha de xperience d
by this time i had finished my supper and by myhost 's desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke
i had no wan opportunity of observing him and found him of avery marked physiognomy
his face was astron gave rys trong aquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temple sbu tpr of use lye lse where
his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with bush yha irth at seemed to curl in its own profusion

as the count leaned over mean dhis hands touched me ico uld not repress a shudder
it may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would ico uld not conceal
the count evidently not icing it drew back
and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his prot ruber an tte eths at himself down again on his own side of the fireplace
we were both silent for awhile and as i looked towards the window is a wthe first dims trea kof the coming dawn

it is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the last twenty four hours
isle ptt ill late in the day and awoke of my own accord
when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had supped and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hot bythe pot being placed on the heart h

the rear ece rtai nly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidence so fwe alt hwh ich are round me
the table service is of gold and so beautiful ly wrought that it must be of immense value
the curtains and upholstery of the chair sands of a sand the hanging so fm ybe dare of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been off a bul ous value when the yw ere made for the yare centuries old though in excellent order
is awsome thing like the minha mpt on court but the yw ere worn and frayed and moth eaten
but still in non eof the rooms is the ream irr or
the reis not even at oil et glass on my table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair
ihave not yet seen as erv an tan yw here or heard as ound near the castle except the howling of wolves
sometime after i had finished my meal id on otk now whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and six o'clock when i had it ilo ok eda bout for something to read for idi dno tli keto go about the castle until i had asked the count 's permission
the rewa sabs olu tel ynot hing in the room booknews paper or even writing materials so i opened another door in the room and found as orto fl ibrary
the door opposite mine it ried but found locked
in the library if ound to my great delight avast number of english book sw holes he lve sfu llo fthe man dbo und volume so fma gazi nesa ndn ews papers

the re were even such books of reference as the london directory there dan dbl ueb ooks whitaker 's almanac the army and navy list sand its ome how gladdened my heart to see it the law list
whilst i was looking at the book sthe door opened and the count entered
he salute dme in a heart yw ayan dho ped that i had had a good night 's rest
the nhe went on
iam glad you found your way in here for iams ure the reis much that will interest you
the sec omp anions and he laid his hand on some of the book shave been good friends to mean dfor some years past ever since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours of pleasure

true iknow the grammar and the words but yet iknow not howtos peak them
indeed is a id you speak excellent ly
not so he answered

that is not enough for me

you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my newest at ein london

and iwould that you tell me when i make error even ofthe smallest in my speaking
iams or ryt hat iha dto be away solo ngt oday but you will iknow for give one who has soma ny important affairs in hand
ofcourse is a ida lli could about being willing and asked if i might come into that room when i chose
he answered yes certainly an dad de d
you may go anywhere you wish i nthe castle except where the doors are locked where ofcourse you will not wish to go
the reis reason that all things are as the yare and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand
is a idi was sure of this and the nhe went on
we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england
our way sare not your way sand there shall be to you many strange things
nay from what you have to ldm eof your experience sal ready you know something of what strange things there may be
this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talking 's sake ias ked him many questions regarding things that had already happened to me or come with in my notice
sometimes he sheer edo fft he subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally he answered all ias ked most frankly
the nast ime went on and i had got some what bolder ias ked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the place sw here he had seen the blue flames
he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on acer tain night of the year last night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked sway a blue flame is seen over anyplace where treasure has been concealed
that treasure has been hidden he went on inthe region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt
for it was the ground fought over force ntu ries by the wall ach ian the saxon and the turk
why the reis hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders
in the old days there were stirring times when the austrian and the hungarian came up in hordes and the patriots went out to meet the mme nand women the age dan dthe children to oand waited their coming on the rocks above the passes that the ym ights we epd est ruc tion on the mwi tht heir artificial avalanche s
when the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever the rewa shad been sheltered in the friendly soil
but how said ican it have remained so long undiscovered when the reis as urei ndex to it if men will butt ake the trouble to look
the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely
he answered because you rpe as an tisa the art aco ward and a fool
those flames only appear on one night and on that night noman of this land will if he can help its tir without his door s
and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to do
why event he peasant that you tell me of whom a rke dthe place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work
even you would not ida re be sworn beable to find the sep laces again
the rey oua re right is a id
iknow no more than the dead where event olo ok for the m
the nwe drifted into other matters
come he said atlas tte llm eof london and ofthe house which you have procured for me
with an apology for my remiss ness i went into my own room to get the paper sfr omm yba g
whilst i was placing the minor der ihe ardara ttl in gof china and silver in the next room and as ipass edt hr ough notice dth at the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark
the lamps were also lit in the study or library and if ound the count lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an english bradshaw 's guide
when i came in hec lear edt he books and papers from the table and with him i went into plans and deeds and figures of all sorts
he was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings
he clearly had studied before hand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently a tthe end knew very much more than i did
when i remarked this he answered
well but my friend is it not need ful that is hould
when i got here is hall be all alone and my friend harker jonathan nay pardon me
if all into my country 's habit of putting your patronymic first my friend jonathan harker will not be by my side to correct and aid me
he will be in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend peter hawkins
so
we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet
when i had to ldh imt he facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with the mre a dy to post to mr
hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across sosui table aplac e
ire adt ohim the notes which i had made at the time and which i inscribe here
at purfleet on a by road icam eac ross just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed adil api date dno tice that the place was for sale
it was surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stone sand has not been repaired for a large number of years
the closed gates are of heavy old oak and iron all eaten with rust
the estate is called carfax no doubt acor ruption of the old quatre face as the house is four sided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass
it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall abovementioned
the rear eman yt rees on it which make it in place sgl oom yand the reis adee pda rkl ooking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs asthe water is clear and flows away in a fair sized stream
the house is very large and of all periods back is hould say to mediaeval times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron
it looks like part of a keep and is close to an old chapel or church
ico uld not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak view sofi tfr omv ari ous points
the house had been added to but in avery straggling way and ican only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great
the rear ebu tfe who uses close at hand on ebe in gave ryla rge house only recently added to and formed in to a private lunatic asylum
it is not however visible from the ground s
when i had finished he said iam glad that it is old and big
i myself am of an old family and to live in an ew house would kill me
aho use can not be made habitable in a day and after all how few days goto make up a century
ire joice also that the reis acha pelo fold times
we transylvania nno bles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead
is eek not gaiety norm irth not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please they oung and gay
iam nolonger young and my heart through wear yy ears of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth
moreover the walls of my castle are broken
the shadows are many and the wind breathe scold through the broken battlements and casement s
ilove the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thoughts when i may
somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast of face made his smile look malignant and saturn in e
presently with an excuse he left me asking me to pull my papers together
he was some little time away and i began to look at some of the book saro und me
one was an atlas which i found opened naturally to england as if that map had been much used
on looking at it if ound in certain places little rings marked and one xa mining these in otice dth at one was near london on the eastside manifestly where his newest at ewa ssi tua ted
the other two were exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast
it was the better part of an hour when the count returned
aha
he said
still at your books
good
but you must not work always
come
iam informed that you rs upper is ready
he took my armand we went into the next room where i found an excellent supper ready onthe table
the count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home
but he sat as onthe previous night and chatted whilst i ate
after supper is moke das on the last evening and the count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour
if elt that it was getting very late in deed but i did not say anything for if elt under obligation to meet my host 's wishes in every way
iwas not sleep yast he longs lee pye ster day had fortified me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide
the ysa yth at people who are near death die generally at the change to dawn or at the turn of the tide
anyone who has when tired and tied as it were to his post experience dth is change in the atmosphere can well believe it
all at once we heard the crow of the cock coming up with preternatural shrill ness through the clear morning air
count dracula jumping to his feet said why the reis the morning again
how remiss iam to let you stay up solo ng
you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by us and with a court ly bow he quickly left me
i went into my room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice
my window open edin to the courtyard all ico uld see was the war mgr eyo fq uic ken in gsk y
so i pulled the curtains again and have written ofthis day
may
i began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting to odi ff use
but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for the reiss ome things ostra nge about this place and all in it that icann otb utf eel uneasy
i wish i were safe out of it or that i had never come
it may be that this strange night existence is telling on me but would that that were all
if the re were anyone total kto ico uld be a rit but there is no one
ihave only the count to speak with an dhe if ear iam myself the only living soul within the place
let me be prosaic sofa ras facts can be
it will help me to be a rupa ndim agin ation must not run riot with me
if it does iam lost
let me say at once how is tand or see mto
ion lys lept afew hours when i went to be dan dfee ling that i could not sleep anymore got up
i had hung my shaving glass bythe window and was just beginning to shave
suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the count 's voice saying to me goodmorning
is tarte dfor it amazed me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me
in starting iha dc utm ys elf slightly but did not notice it at the moment
having answered the count 's salutation it urn edt othe glass again to see how i had been mistaken
this time there could be noerror for the man was close to mean dico uld see him over my shoulder
but there was no reflection of him in the mirror
the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of amani nite xc ept myself
this was startling and coming on the top of soma nys trang eth in gsw as beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is near
but at the instant is a wth a tthe cut had bled alittle and the blood was trickling over my chin
i laid down the razor turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster
when the count saw my face his eyes blazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab a tm yth roa t
id re wawa yand his hand touched the string of beads which he ldt he crucifix
it made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there
take care hesa id take care how you cut yourself
it is more dangerous that you think i nthis country
the nse izing the shaving glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief
it is a foul bauble of man 's vanity
away with it
and opening the window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below
the nhe with drew without a word
it is very annoying for ido not see how i am to shave unless in my watch case or the bottom of the shaving pot which is fortunately of metal
when i went into the dining room breakfast was prepared but i could not find the count anywhere
so i breakfast eda lone
it is strange that as yet ihave not seen the count eat or drink
he must be avery peculiar man
after breakfast id id alittle exploring in the castle
i went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south
the view was magnificent and from where is to odt here was ever yo pport unit yof seeing it
the castle is on the very edge of a terrific precipice
aston efa lling from the window would fall at hous and feet without touching anything
as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasional lya deep rift where the reis acha sm
here and the rear esi lve rth read sw here the river swin din deep gorges through the forest s
but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view iexplore dfu rthe r
doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted
in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is the rea nava ilab lee xit
the castle is a veritable prison and i am apr iso ner
chapter jonathan harker 's journal continued when i found that iwasa prisoner as orto fwi ldf eel in gca me over me
iru she dupa nd down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window ico uld find but after alittle the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings
when i look back after a few hours ithink imus tha veb een mad for the time for ibe have dmu chas ara tdo esi natra p
when however the conviction had come to me that i was helpless is a tdo wn quietly as quietly as ihave ever done anything in my life and began to think over what was best to be done
iam thinking still and as yet have come to node finite conclusion
of one thing only a mice rtai n
that it is no use making my ideas known to the count
he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if it rusted him fully with the fact s
sofa ras ican see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open
iam iknow either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter besoin eeda nds hall need all my brain sto get through
i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut and knew that the count had returned
he did not come at once in to the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed
this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along thought that the rear enos erv an tsin the house
when later is a whim through the chin kof the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining room iwasa ssu red of it
for if he does himself all the semen ial office ssu rely it is proof that the reis noone else in the castle it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here
this is a terrible thought for if so what does it meant hath eco uld control the wolves as he did by only holding up his hand for silence
how was it that all the people at bist ritz and onthe coach had some terrible fear for me
what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash
bless that good good woman who hung the crucifix round my neck
for it is a comfort and as treng tht ome whenever it ouch it
it is odd that at hing which ihave been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help
is it that the reiss ome thing in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium at an gible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort
sometime if it may be imus tex amine this matter and try to make up my mind about it
in the meantime i must find out all ican about count dracula as it may help me to understand
tonight he may talk of himself if it urn the conversation that way
imus tbe very careful however not to awake his suspicion
midnight
ihave had along talk with the count
ias ked him a few questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderful ly
in his speaking of things and people and especially of battle she spoke as if he had been present at the mall
this he afterwards explained by saying that to a boy art hep ride of his house and name is his own pride that the irg lory is his glory that the irfa teis his fate
whenever he spoke of his house heal ways said we and spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking
i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it for tome it was most fascinating
it seemed to have in it a whole history of the country
hegre we xcite dashes poke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength
one thing he said which is hall put down as nearly as i can for it tells init sway the story of his race
we szekely shave aright to be proud for in our veins flows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fight sfor lordship

this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything has to break off at cock crow or like the ghost of hamlet 's father
may
let me begin with facts bare meager facts verified by books and figures and of which the rec an ben odo ubt
imus tno tcon fuse the mwi the xperience sw hich will have to rest on my own observation or my memory of the m
last evening when the count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and onthe doing of certain kinds of business
i had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matter sih adbe ene xa mine dina tli ncol n ' sin n
the rewa sace rtai nme tho dint he count 's inquiries so i shall try to put the mdo wn in sequence
the knowledge may somehow or sometime be useful to me
first he asked if amani neng land might have two solicitors or more
it old him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be certain to militate against his interest
he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if the re would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend say to banking and another to look after shipping incase local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor
ias ked to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead him so he said is hall illustrate
your friend and mine mr
peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from london buy sfor meth rough your goods elf myplace at london
good
nowhere let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that ihave sought the services of one sofa roff from london instead of someone resident the retha tm ym oti vew as that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i went thus afield to see km yag ent whose labour ssh ould be only to my interest
now suppose i who have much of affairs wish to ship goods say to newcastle or durham or harwich or dover might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning to one in the sep or ts
ian swer edt hat certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system of agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitors otha tthe clients imply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble
but said he ico uld be at liberty to direct myself
is it not so
ofcourse ire plied and such is often done by men of business who do not like the whole of the iraf fair stob ek now nb yan yon eper son
good
he said and the nwe nto nto ask about the means of making consignment sand the form stob egon eth rough and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against
i explained all the set hing sto him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for the rewa snot hing that he did not think of or for ese e
for a man who was never in the country and who did not evident lyd om uchi nthe way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful
when he had satisfied himself on the sep oint so fw hich he had spoken and i had verified all aswell as i could bythe books available he suddenly stood up and said have you written since your first letter to our friend mr
peter hawkins or to any other
it was with some bitterness in my heart that i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody
the nwri ten owm yy oung friend he said laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please youth at you shall stay with me until amon th from now
do you wish me to stay solo ng
ias ked for my heart grew cold at the thought
ides ire it much nay iwill taken or ef usa l
when you rmas tere mpl oyer what you will engage dth at someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted
ihave not stint ed
is it not so
what could id obu tbo wacc ept an ce
it was mr
hawkins ' interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while count dracula was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that iwasa prisoner and that if i wish edit ico uld have no choice
the count saw his victory in my bow and his master yin the trouble of my face for he began at once to use the mbu tinh is owns moot hres is tle ssw a y

so i determined to write only for mal notes now but to write fully to mr
hawkins in secret and also to mina for to her ico uld write shorthand which would puzzle the count if he did see it
when i had written my two letters is a tq uie treading abook whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote the mto some books on his table

he took up the letters on the table and stamped the mca ref ull yand the ntu rning to me said it rusty ou will forgive me but i have much work to do in private this evening

be warned
should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do the nha ste to your own chamber or to the sero oms for your rest will then be safe
but if you be not careful in this respect the nhe finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing the m
i quite understood
my only doubt was a stow hether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me

when he left me i went to my room
after alittle while not hearing any sound icam eou tan dwe ntu pthe stones tair to where i could look out towards the south

looking out on this if elt that i was indeed in prison and is eem edt owa nta breath of fresh air though it were ofthe night

as i leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving astor ey below mean dso me what to my left where i imagine dfr omt he order of the rooms that the windows ofthe count 's own room would look out
the window at which is to odw as tall and deep stone mullion edan dth ough weather worn was still complete
but it was evidently many ada ysi nce the case had been there
id re wba ckb ehi ndt heston ework and looked carefully out
what is a wwa sthe count 's head coming out from the window
id id not see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms
in any case ico uld not mistake the hands which i had had some many opportunities of studying
iwasa tfi rst interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small am at ter will interest and amuse aman when he is a prisoner
but my very feelings change dtor epu lsi on and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over the dreadful abyss facedown with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings
at first ico uld not believe my eyes
it hough tit was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could be node lus ion
is a wthe fingers and to esgr as pthe corner soft heston es worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by thus using every project iona ndi neq uality moved own wards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall

iam encompassed about with terror sth at ida reno tth in kof
may
once more ihave seen the count go out in his lizard fashion
he moved down wards in aside long way some hundred feet down and ago odd eal to the left
he vanished into some hole or window
when his head had disappeared ile a ned out to try and see more but without a vail
the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight
i knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet
i went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors
the yw ere all locked as i had expected and the locks were comparatively new
but i went down the stones tair sto the hall where i had entered originally
if ound ico uld pullback the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains
but the door was locked and the key was gone
that key must be in the count 's room
imus twat chsh ould his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape
i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from the m
one or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in the mex cept old furniture dusty with a gea nd moth eaten
atlas thow ever if ound one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed locked gave alittle under pressure
it ried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor
here was an opportunity which i might not have again so i exerted myself and with many efforts for cedit back so that i could enter
iwas now in a wing of the castle further to the right than the rooms ikn ewan das tor ey lower down
from the windows ico uld see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows ofthe end room looking out both west and south
onthe latter side aswell as to the former there was a great precipice
the castle was built on the corner of agreat rocks otha to nth rees ides it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where slingo rbo worc ulver in could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to apo sition which had to be guarded were secured
to the west was a great valley and the nris in gfa raw a yg re at jagged mountain fastness esri sing peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clung in cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone
this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had more ana iro fco mfor tth an any iha dse en
the windows were curtain less and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond panes enabled on eto see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which layover all and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and moth
my lamps eem edt obe of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was glad to have it with me for the rewa sadr ead loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves trembl e
still it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count and after trying alittle to school myne rv esi found as of tq uie tude come over me

and yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had an dha vep ower soft heir own which mere modernity can not kill

whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed iben otm ada lre a dy
if i be sane the nsure ly it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone ican look for safety eventhough this be only whilst i can serve his purpose
great god
merciful god let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed
i begin to get new light son certain things which have puzzled me

for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing it urn to my diary for repose
the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me
the count 's mysterious warning frightened me at the time
it frightens me more now when it hink of it for inthe future he has a fearful hold upon me
is hall fear to doubt what he may say
when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket if elts lee py
the count 's warning came into my mind but it ook pleasure in disobeying it
the sense of sleep was upon mean dwi thi tthe obstinacy which sleep brings a sout rider
the soft moonlight soothed and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me
ide termined not to return to night to the gloom haunted rooms but to sleep here where of old ladies had satan dsu ngan dlive dsw eet lives whilst the irg ent le breasts were sad for the irm en folk away in the midst of remorseless wars

iwas not alone
the room was the same unchanged in anyway since i came into it
ico uld see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own footsteps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust
in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies bythe ird res sandman ner

one said goon

the other added he is young and strong

i lay quiet looking out from under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation

iwasa fraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes
the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply gloating
the rewa sade liberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually licked her lips like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and onthe red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth
lower and lower went her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and china nds eem edt of a steno nm yth roa t

i closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and waited waited with beating heart

iwas conscious of the presence of the count and of his being a sif lapped in astor moff ury
as my eyes opened in voluntarily is a whi sst ron ghan dgr as pthe slender neck of the fair woman and with giant 's power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth champ in gwi thr a gea ndt he fair cheeks blazing red with passion
but the count
never did i imagine such wrath and fury event othe demons of the pit
his eyes were positively blazing
the redlight in the mwa slur idas ifthe flames of hellfire blazed behind the m
his face was deathly pale and the lines of it were hard like drawn wires
the thick eyebrows that met over the nose now seemed like a heaving bar of white hot metal
with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and the nmo tioned to the other sast hough hewer ebe at ing the mba ck
it was the same imperious gesture that i had seen used to the wolves
in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and the nri ngi nthe room he said how dare you to uch him any of you

onthis the other women joined and such a mirth less hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear
it seemed like the pleasure of fiends
the nth eco unt turned after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper yes it ooc an love

said one of the mwi thal owl aug has she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though the re were some living thing with init
for answer he nodded his head
one of the women jumped forward and opened it
if my ears did not deceive me there was a gas panda low wail as of a half smothered child
the women closed round whilst i was aghast with horror
but as i looked the ydi sapp eared and with the mthe dreadful bag

if it be that i had not dream tthe count must have carried me here
it ried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result
to be sure there were certain small evidence ssu chas that my clothes were folded and laid by ina manner which was not my habit
my watch was still unwound and i am rigorously accustomed to win ditt he last thing before going to be dan dman ysu chd eta ils

as i look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now as orto fsa nctu ary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who were who are waiting to suck my blood

ihave been down to look at that room again in daylight for imus tkn owt he truth
when i got to the doorway at the top of the stairs if ound it closed
it had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered
ico uld see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside
if ear it was no dream and must act on this surmise
may
iams ure lyin the toils
last night the count as ked mein the suave st tones to write three letters one saying that my work here was nearly done and that is hould start for home with in a few days another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at bist ritz
iwould fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel open ly with the count whilst i am so absolutely in his power
and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger
he knows that iknow to om uch and that i must not live lest i be dangerous to him
my only chance is to prolong my opportunities
something may occur which will give me a chance to escape
is a win his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him
he explained to me that post swer efe wand uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends
and he assured me with so much impressive ness that he would counter man dthe later letters which would be held over at bist ritz until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that too ppos ehi mwo uld have been to create new suspicion
it here for epr eten de dto fall in with his views and asked him what dates is hould put on the letters
he calculated amin ute and the nsaid the first should be june these cond june and the third june
iknow now the span of my life

last night the count left me early and locked himself into his own room
as soon as i dare dir an up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south
it hough ti would watch for the count for the reiss ome thing going on
the szg any are quarter eds ome where in the castle and are doing work of some kind
iknow it for now and the nih ear afar away muffled sound as of mattock and spade and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villain y
i had been at the windows ome what less than half an hour when i saw something coming out of the count 's window
id re wba cka nd watched carefully and saw the whole man emerge
it was an ews hock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i had seen the women takeaway
the reco uld be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb to o
this then is his new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as the yth in ks otha the may both leave evidence that ihave been seen in the town so rv ill ages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall bythe local people beat tribute dto me
it makes me rage to think that this can go on and whilst i am shutup here ave rita ble prisoner but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal 's right and consolation
it hough ti would watch for the count 's return an dfor along time sat doggedly at the window

if elt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts
nay my very soul was struggling and my half remember eds en sibilities were striving to answer the call
iwas becoming hypnotised

the moonbeams seemed to quiver as the yw ent by mein to the mass of gloom beyond
more and more they gathered till the ys eem edt ota ked imp han to msha pes
and the nist art ed broad awake and in full possession of my senses and ran screaming from the place
the phantom shapes which were becoming gradually material is edf rom the moonbeams were those three ghostly women to whom i was doomed
if led and felt somewhat safe rin my own room where the rewa snom oon light and where the lamp was burning brightly
when a couple of hours had passed ihe ards ome things tir ring in the count 's room something like a sharp wail quickly suppressed

june
no man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be
when the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dove from the ark had lighted the re
my fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth
imus tta kea ction of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me
last night on eof my post date dle tter swen tto post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth
let me not think of it

it has always been at night time that ihave been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear
ihave not yet seen the count in the daylight
can it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst the ysl eep
if i could only get into his room
but there is no possible way
the door is always locked now a yfor me
yes there is a way if one dares to take it
where his body has gone why maynot another body go
ihave seen him myself crawl from his window
why should not ii mita teh iman dgo in by his window
the chance sare desperate but my need is more desperate still
is hall risk it
atthe worst it can only be death and aman 's death is not a calf 's and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me

iwas filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window
the nilo ok eda round for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery
the room was empty
it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used
the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust
ilo ok edf or the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere
the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one corner gold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long int he ground
none of it that in otice dwa sles sth an three hundred years old
the re were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of the mold and stained
atone corner of the room was a heavy door
it ried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search imus tmake further examination or all my efforts would be in vain
it was open and led through aston epass age to a circular stairway which went steeply down

it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so i asked him point blank why may in otg oto night
because dear sir my coach man and horses are away on a mission
but i would walk with pleasure

he smiled such as of tsm oot hdi a bolic als mile that i knew there was some trick behind his smoothness
he said and your baggage

the count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes its eem eds oreal you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our boyars ' welcome the coming speed the parting guest
' come with me my dear young friend
not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sadam iat your going and that you so suddenly desire it

with a state ly gravity hewit hthe lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall
suddenly he stopped
hark
close at hand came the howling of many wolves
it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of agreat orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor
after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his state ly way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chain sand began to draw it open
to my intense astonishment is a wth a tit was unlocked
suspiciously ilo ok eda llr ound but could see no key of any kind

i knew than that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless
with such allies as the seat his command ico uld donot hing

suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of mydoom
iwas to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation

and i covered my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment
with one sweep of his powerful arm the count threw the doors hut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as the ys hot back into the irp laces
in silence were turned to the library and after a minute or two iw ent to my own room
the last is a wof count dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a redlight of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of

well my dear number one came just before lunch
it old you of him dr
john seward the lunatic asylum man with the strong jawa ndt he good for ehe a d
he was very cool outwardly but was nervous all the same
he had evidently been school in ghi msel fast oal lso rts of little things and remember edt he mb uthe almost managed to sit down on his silk hat which mendon ' tge nera lly do when the yare cool and the nw he nh ewanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream
he spoke to me mi nave rys trai ght forward ly
he told me how dear iwas to him though he had known me so little and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him
he was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if i did not care for him but when he saw me cry he said he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble
the nhe broke off and asked if i could love him in time and when i shook my head his hands trembl edan dthe nwi ths ome hesitation he asked me if i care dal ready for anyone else
he put it very nice lys a ying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me but only to know because i faw oman 's heart was free aman might have hope
and the nmi naif elta sort of duty to tell him that the rewa sso me one
ion lyt old him that much and the nhes to odu pan dhe looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped iwould be happy and that if i ever wanted a friend imus tco unt him on eof my best
oh min adea rican ' the lpcr ying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted
being proposed to isa ll very nice and all that sort of thing but it is n't atallah app yth in gwh en you have to see a poor fellow who my ouk now loves you honestly going away and looking all brokenhearted and to know that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passing out of his life
my dear imus tst oph ere at present if eels omis erable though i am so happy
evening
arthur has just gone and if eel in better spirits than when i left off so i can go on telling you about the day
well my dear number two came after lunch
he is such an ice fellow an american from texas and he looks so you ngan dso fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to soman yp laces and has such adventures
is ymp at hi zew it hp oord esd emo naw hens he had such as trea mpo ured in here are ven by a black man
is up pose that we women are such cowards that we think aman will save us from fear sand we marry him
iknow now what i would do if i were amana nd wanted to make a girl love me
no id on ' tfor the rewa smr
morris telling us his stories and arthur never told any and yet
my dear iams ome what previous
mr
quincy p
morris found meal one
it seems that amana lwa ys does find a girl alone
no hedo esn ' tfor arthur tried twice to make a chance and i helping him all ico uld iam not ashamed to say it now
imus tte lly ou beforehand that mr
morris does n't always speaks lang that is to say he never does so to strangers or before the mfor he is really well educated and has exquisite manner sbu the found out that it amused me to hear him talk american slang and whenever i was present and the rewa sno one to be shocked he said such funny thing s
iam a fraid my dear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say
but this is a way slang has
id on otk now myself if i shall ever speak slang
id on otk now if arthur like sit as ihave never heard him use any as yet
well mr
morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could but i could see all the same that he was very nervous
he took my hand in his and said ever so sweet ly
miss lucy iknow iain ' tgo oden ought or eg ulate the fixin ' so fy our little shoes but i guess i fy ou wait till you find a man that is you will go joint he mse ven young women with the lamps when you quit
won't you just hit chupa long side of mean dle tus god own the long road together driving in double harness
well he did look so good humoured and so jolly that it did n't see mha lfs oh ard to refuse him as it did poor dr
seward
so i said as lightly as i could that i did not know anything of hitching a ndt hat iwas n't broken to harness at all yet
the nhes aid that he had spoken in alight manner and he hoped that if he had made a mistake in doing so on so grave so momentous an occasion for him iwould for give him
here all ydi dlo ok serious when he was saying it and i could n't help feeling abit serious too iknow min ayo uwi llt hink me a horrid flirt though i could n't help feeling as orto fe xul tation that he was number two in one day
and the nm yd ear before i could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking laying his very heart and soul at my feet
he looked so earnest over it that is hall never again think that aman must be playful always and never earnest because he is merry at times
is up pose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of man lyfe rv our that i could have loved him for if i had been free
lucy you are an honest heart edg irl iknow

that 's my brave girl
it 's better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world
don't cry my dear

if that other fellow does n't know his happiness well he 'd better look for its oon or he 'll have to deal with me
little girl you rhone st yand pluck have made me a friend and that 's rare rth anal over it 's more selfish anyhow
my dear i'm going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and kingdom come

whitby
lucy met me at the station looking sweeter and love lie rth an ever and we drove up to the house at the crescent inwhich the yha vero oms
this is a lovely place
the little river the esk runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near the harbour
agreat viaduct runs across with high piers through which the views eem sso me how further away than it really is
the valley is beautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the highland one ither side you look right across it unless you are near enough to see down
the house soft he oldtown the side away from usa real lre dro of edan dse empi led upon eo vert he other anyhow like the pictures we see of nuremberg
right over the town is the ruin of whitby abbey which was sacked by the danes and which is the scene of part of marmion where the girl was built up in the wall
it is a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits
the reis ale gen dth at a white lady is seen in one of the windows
between it and the town there is another church the parish one round which is a big graveyard all full of tombstones
this is to my mind the nicest spot in whitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bay to where the headland called kettle ness stretches out into the sea
it descends so steep lyo vert he harbour that part of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have been destroyed
in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below
the rear ewa lks with seats beside the mth rough the church yard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze
is hall come and sit here often myself and work
indeed iam writing now with my book on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me
the ys eem to do not hing all day but sith ere and talk
the harbour lies below me with onthe farside one long granite walls tre tch in gout into the sea with a curve outward sat the end of it in the middle of which is a lighthouse
ah ea vyse awal lru nsa long outside of it
onthe nearside the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely and its end to oha sali ght house
between the two piers the reis an arrow opening into the harbour which the nsu dde nly wide ns
it is nice at high water but when the tide is out its hoa lsa way to nothing and the reis merely the stream of the esk running between banks of sand with rocks here and the re
outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half a mile agreat reef the sharp of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse
atthe end of it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in amour nfu lso undo nthe wind
the yha veale gen dhe retha twh enas hip is lost bells are heard out at sea
imus task the old man about this
he is coming this way
he is a funny old man
he must be awfully old for his face is gnarled and twisted like the bar kof at ree
he tells me that he is nearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the greenland fishing fleet when waterloo was fought
he is iam a fraid avery sceptical person for when i asked him about the bells at sea and the white lady at the abbey he said very brusquely iwould n't fash mase l' about the mmis s

iwon derma sel ' who 'd be bothered tell in ' lies to the mev ent he newspapers which is full of fool talk
it hough the would be a good person to learn interesting things from so i asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale fishing in the old days

he disgusted me much while with him for when a horrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room he caught it held it exultant lyf or a few moments between his finger and thumb and before i knew what he was going to do put it in his mouth and at eit
is cold ed him for it but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome that it was life strong life and gave life to him
this gave me an idea or the rudi men to fone
imus twat chh ow he gets rid of his spiders
he has evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keeps alittle notebook inwhich he is always jotting down something
whole page so fit are filled with masses of figures generally single number sad de dupin batches and the nth et otal sad de din batches again as though he were focussing some account as the auditor spu tit

things remain as the yw eree xc ept that he has part ed with some of his pets and got a new one
he has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially tamed it
his means of taming is simple for already the spiders have diminished
those that do remain however are well fed for he still brings in the flies by tempting the mwi th his food

iwas not unprepared for this request for iha dno tice dhow his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity but i did not care that his pretty family of tames parr ows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders
so i said iwould see about it and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten
his eagerness betrayed him as he answered oh yes iwould like a cat
ion lya sked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat
noone would refuse me a kitten would they

mr
holmwood has been suddenly called to ring to see his father who has been taken seriously ill

chapter cutting from the daily graph august past edin min am urr a y 's journal from a correspondent
whitby
one of the greatest and sudden est storms on record has just been experienced herewith results both strange and unique
the weather had been somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of august
saturday evening was a sfi neas was ever known and the great body of holidaymakers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods robinhood 's bay rig mill run swick staithes and the various trips in the neighborhood of whitby
the steamer sem maand scarborough made trips up and down the coast and the rewa san unusual amount of ' tripping ' both to and from whitby
the day was unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossip sw hof re quent the east cliff churchyard and from the commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east called attention to as ud den show of 'm are stai ls ' high in the sky to the northwest
the wind was the nbl owing from the southwest in the mild degree which in barometric all anguage is ranked ' no
light breeze
' the coastguard on duty at once made report and one old fisherman who form or ethan half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff for etol dinan emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm
the approach of sunset was so very beautiful so grand init smas ses of splendidly coloured clouds that the rewa squ it ean assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old church yard to enjoy the beauty
before the sun dipped below the black mass of kettle ness standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour flame purple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with her eand the rema sses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in all sorts of shapes aswell outlined as colossal silhouettes
the experience was not lost on the painter sand doubtless some of the sketches of the ' prelude to the great storm ' will grace the r
aand r
i
walls in may next
more than one captain made up his mind the nand the retha this ' cobble ' or his 'm ule ' as the yt erm the different classes of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed
the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there was a dead calm as ultr yhe at and that prevailing in tensity which onthe approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature
the re were but few lights insight at sea for event he coasting steamers which usually hug the shores ocl ose lyke pt well to seaward and but few fishing boats were insight
the only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westward s
the fool hardiness or ignorance of her office rsw as a prolific the mef or comment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sailin the face of her danger
before the night shutdown she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating swell of the sea
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
shortly before ten o'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep in land or the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and the band on the pier with its lively french air was like a dischord in the great harmony of nature 's silence
alittle after midnight came as trang esound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to carry a strange faint hollow booming
the nwi thou twa rning the tempest broke
with a rapidity which atthe times ee medi ncr edible and even after wards is impossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed
the waves rose in growing fury each overtopping its fellow till i nave ry few minutes the late ly glass ys eaw as like a roaring and devouring monster
white crested waves beat madly on the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs
other sbr ok eo vert he piers and with the irs pum es we ptt he lan thorns of the lighthouse sw hich rise from the end of either piero fw hit by harbour
the wind roared like thunder and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept the irf eet or clung with grim clasp to the iron stanchions
it was found necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of onlookers or else the fatalities of the night would have increased manifold
to add to the difficulties and dangers of the time masses of sea fog came drifting in land
white we tcl oud sw hich swept by in ghostly fashion soda nka nd damp and cold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirit soft hose lost at sea were touching the irl iv in gbr eth re nwi tht hecla mm yha nds of death and many aone shuddered as the wreaths of sea mist swept by
at times the mist cleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning which came thick and fast followed by such peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm
some of the scenes thus revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest
the sea running mountain shi ght hr ews ky wards with each wave might yma sses of white foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space
here and the rea fishing boat with a rag of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of astor mto ssed seabird
onthe summit of the east cliff the new search light was ready for experiment but had not yet been tried
the office rsi nchar geo fit got it into working order and in the pauses of onrushing mists we pt with it the surface of the sea
once or twice its service was most effective as when a fishing boat with gunwale underwater rushed into the harbour able bythe guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger of dashing against the piers
as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on the shore as hout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was the nsw ept away in its rush
before long these arch light discovered some distance away as choon erw it hall sails set apparently the same vessel which had been noticed earlier in the evening
the wind had by this time backed to the east and the rewa sash udder amongst the watchers on the cliff as the yr eal ized the terrible danger in which she now was
between her and the port lay the great flat reef on which soma ny goods hips have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour
it was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were so great that in the irt rough sthe shall ows of the shore were almost visible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with such speed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it was only in hell
the nca mean other rush of sea fogg re ater than any hitherto amass of dan km is twh ich seemed to close on all things like a gray palla nd left available to me no nly the organ of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty bill ows came through the damp oblivion even louder than before
the rays of the search light were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the east pier where the shock was expected and men waited breathless
the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and the remnant of the sea fog melted in the blast
and the nmi rabi led ict ube tween the piers leaping from wave to wave as it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schooner before the blast with all sails etan dga in edt he safety of the harbour
the search light followed her and as hud der rant hr ough all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a corpse with drooping head which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship
no other form could be seen on the deck at all
agreat awe came on all asthe yr eal is edt hat the ship as if by amir acle had found the harbour unst eere dsa veb ythe hand of a deadman
however all too kpl ace more quickly than it takes to write the sew or ds
the schooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the east cliff known locally as tate hill pier
the rewa so fco urs eac on siderable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand heap
every sparr ope and stay was strained and some of the ' top hammer ' came crashing down
but strange sto fall the very instant the shore was touched an immense dogs prang upon deck from below as if shot up by the concussion and running for war dj ump edf rom the bow on the sand
making straight for the steep cliff where the church yard hangs over the laneway to the east piers ost eep lyth at some of the flat tombstones thru ffs tea nso rth rough stone sast hey call the min whitby vernacular actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the search light
it so happened that the rewa sno one at the moment on tate hill pier as a llt hose whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the height sabo ve
thus the coastguard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little pier was the first to climb aboard
the men working the search light after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything the ntu rne dthe light on the derelict and kept it there
the coastguard rana fta nd when he came beside the wheel be nto verto examine it and recoiled at once a sth ough under some sudden emotion
this seemed to pique general curiosity and quite a number of people began to run
it is a good way round from the westcliff by the drawbridge to tate hill pier but you rco rre spondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowd
when i arrived however if ound already assembled on the pier acro wdw hom the coastguard and police refused to allow to come on board
by the court es yof the chief boatman iwasa syo urc or respondent permitted to climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead sea man whilst actually lashed to the wheel
it was now on der that the coastguard was surprised or even a wed for not often can such as ight have been seen
the man was simply fast en ed by his hands tied one over the other to as poke of the wheel
between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast bythe binding cords
the poor fellow may have been seated at one time but the flapping and buffeting of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and had dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone
accurate not ewa smad eof the state of things and a doctor surgeon j
m
caff yno feast elliot place who came immediately after me declared after making examination that the man must have been dead for quite two days
in his pocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for alittle roll of paper which proved to be the addendum to the log
the coastguard said the man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with his teeth
the fact that acoa st guard was the first onboard may save some complications later on inthe admiralty court for coastguard scan not claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict
already however the legal tongue sare wagging and one young laws tudent is loudly as ser ting that the right soft he owner area lre a dy completely sacrifice dhis property being held in contravention of the statue so fmo rtm ainsi nce the tiller as emblems hip if not proof of delegated possession is held in a dead hand
it is needless to say that the dead steers man has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death as tea dfas tness as noble as that of the young casa bianca and placed in the mortuary to await inquest
already the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is a bat in g
crowds are scattering backward and the sky is beginning to redden over the yorkshire wolds
is hall send in time for your next issue further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm
august
the sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself
it turns out that the schooner is russian from varna and is called the demeter
she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only as mall amount of cargo an umber of great wooden boxes filled with mould
this cargo was consigned to a whitby solicitor mr
s
f
billington of the crescent who this morning we nta board and took formal possession of the goods consigned to him
the russian consult ooa ctin gforth ech art erp art yto ok for mal possession of the ship and paid all harbour due set c
nothing is talked about her etod aye xc ept the strange coincidence
the official soft he board of trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations
as the matter is to be a ' nine days wonder ' the yare evidently determined that the res hall be no cause of other complaint
agood deal of interest was abroad concerning the dog which landed when the ships truck and more than a few of the members of the s
p
c
a
which is very strong in whitby have tried to befriend the animal
to the general disappointment however it was not to be found
it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town
it may be that it was frightened and made it sway onto the moors where it is still hiding in terror
the rear eso me who look with dread on such a possibility lest later on its hould in itself become a danger for it is evident lya fierce brute
early this morning ala rge dog aha lfb red mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to tate hill pier was found dead in the roadway opposite its master 's yard
it had been fighting and manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was to rna way and its belly was slit open as if with a savage claw
later
by the kindness of the board of trade inspector ihave been permitted to look over the logbook of the demeter which was in order upto within three days but contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men
the greatest interest however is with regard to the paper found in the bottle which was today produced at the inquest
and amores trang en arra tive than the two between the mun fold it has not been my lottocom eac ross
as the reis no motive for concealment iam permitted to use the man dacc or ding lys end you at ran scripts imply omitting technical details of seamanship and supercar go
it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of man iab efore he had got well into bluewater and that this had developed persistently throughout the voyage
ofcourse my statement must be taken cum gran osi nce iam writing from the dictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translated for me time being short

if so we are now off in the north sea and only god can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and god seems to have deserted us
august
at midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel and when i got to it found no one there
the wind was steady and as we ran before it there was no yaw in g
ida red not leave it so shouted for the mate
after a few seconds her us he dupo nde ckin his flannel s
he looked wild eyed and haggard and igre at lyfe a rhi sre as on has given way
he came close to mean dwh is per ed hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fearing the very air might hear
it is here
iknow it now
onthe watch lastnight is a wit like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale
it was in the bows and looking out
i crept behind it and gave it my knife but the knife went through item pty as the air
and ashes poke he took the knife and drove it savagely into space
the nhe went on but it is here and i'll find it
it is in the hold perhaps in one of those boxes
i'll unscrew the mone by one and see
you work the helm
and with a warning look and his finger on his lip he went below
the rewa ssp ringing up a choppy wind and i could not leave the helm
is a whim come out on deck again with a tool chest and lantern and god own the forward hatchway
he is mad star krav in gma dandi t 's no use my trying to stop him
he can ' thur tth ose big boxes they are invoiced as clay and to pull the mabou tisa sharm less at hing as he can do
so here is taya nd mind the helmand write the seno tes
ican only trusting oda nd wait till the fog clear s
the nif ican ' tst eer to any harbour with the wind that is isha llc utd own sails and lie by and signal for help
it is nearly all over now
just as i was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer for ihe ard him knocking away at something in the hold and work is good for him there came up the hatchway as ud den start leds cream which made my blood run cold and upon the deck he came as if shot from a gun arag in gma dman with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear
save me
save me
he cried and the nlo ok ed round on the blanket of fog
his horror turned to despair and in a steady voice he said you had better come to ocap tain before it is to olate
heist here
iknow the secret now
the sea will save me from him and it is all that is left
before i could say a word or move forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea
is up pose iknow the secret to on ow
it was this madman who had got rid of the men on eby one and now he has followed the mhi msel f
god help me
how amit oac count for all the seh or rors when i get to port
when i get to port
will that ever be
august
still fog which the sunrise can not pierce iknow the reiss un rise because i am a sailor why else iknow not
ida red not go below ida red not leave the helm so here all night is taye dandi nthe dimness of the night is a with im
god forgive me but the mate was right to jump over board
it was better to die like a man
to die like a sailor in bluewater noman can object
but i am captain and imus tno tle ave my ship

iam growing weaker and the night is coming on
if he can look mein the face again ima ynot have time to act
if we are wrecked may hap this bottle maybe found and those who find it may understand
if not
well then all men shall know that ihave been true to my trust
god and the blessed virgin and the saints help apo or ignorant soul trying to do his duty
ofcourse the verdict was an open one
the reis no evidence to add ucea nd whether or not the man himself committed the murder sthe reis now none to say
the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral
already itis arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of boats up the esk for apiece and the nbr ought back to tate hill pier and up the abbey steps for heist obe buried in the church yard on the cliff
the owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in the irna mesa swishing to follow him to the grave
not race has ever been found ofthe great dog at which the reis much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would i believe be adopted by the town
tomorrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more 'm yst ery of the sea '

lucy was very restless all night and it ooc ould not sleep
the storm was fearful and as it boomed loudly among the chimney pots it made me shudder
when a sharp puff came its eem edt obe like a distant gun
strangely enough lucy did not wake but she got up twice and dressed herself
fortunately each time i awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her and got her back to be d
it is a very strange thing this sleepwalking for a sso on asher will ist hwa rted in any physical way he rint ent ion ifthe re bean ydi sapp ears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life
early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night
the re were very few people about and thought he sun was bright and the air clear and fresh the big grim looking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped the mwa slike snow forced themselves in through the mouth of the harbour like a bullying mango in gth rough acro wd
somehow i felt glad that jonathan was not on the sea lastnight but on land
but oh is he on land or sea
where is he and how
iam getting fearfully anxious about him
if i only knew what to do and could do anything
august
the funeral of the poor sea captain today was most touching
every boat in the harbour seemed to be the rea ndt he coffin was carried by captain sall the way from tate hill pier upto the church yard
lucy came with mean dwe went early to our old seat whilst the cortege of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down again
we had a lovely view and saw the process ion nearly all the way
the poor fellow was laid to rest near our seats otha twe stood on it when the time came and saw everything
poor lucy seemed much upset
she was restless and uneasy all the time and icann otb utt hink that he rdr eam in gat night is telling on her
she is quite odd in one thing
she will not admit to me that the reis any cause for restlessness or if the rebe she does not understand it herself
the reis an additional cause in that poor mr
swales was found dead this morning on our seat his neck being broken
he had evidently a sthe doctors aid fallen back in the seat in some sort of fright for the rewa salo ok of fear and horror on his face that the men said made the msh udder
poor dear old man
lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influence smor eacute lyth another people do
just now she was quite upset by alittle thing which i did not much he edt hough iam myself very fond of animals
one of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog
the dog is always with him
the yare both quiet person sand in ever saw the man angry nor heard the dog bark
during the service the dog would not come to its master who was on the seat with us but kept a few yards of fbar king and howling
it smast ers poket oit gently and the nha rsh lya ndt henan gril y
but it would neither come nor cease to make an oise
it was in a fury with its eyes savage and all its hair bristling out like a cat 's tail when pussi son the warpath
finally the man to ogo tang ryan dj ump edd own and kicked the dog and the nto oki tb ythe scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed
the moment it touched the stone the poor thing began to tremble
it did not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was in such a pitiable state of terror that it ried though without effect to comfort it
lucy was full of pity to obu tsh edi dno tatt empt to touch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way
igre at lyfe art hats he is of too super sensitive an ature to go through the world without trouble
she will be dreaming of this tonight i am sure
the whole agglomeration of things the ships tee red into port by a deadman his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terror will all afford material for her dreams
it hink it will be best for her to go to be dti red out physically so i shall take her for along walk by the cliffs to robinhood 's bay and back
she ought not to have much inclination for sleepwalking the n
chapter min am urr a y 's journal same day o'clock p
m
oh but i am tired
if it were not that i had made my diary adut yi should not open it tonight
we had a lovely walk
lucy after awhile was in gays piri tso wing it hink to some dear cows who came nosing towards us in afield close to the lighthouse and frightened the wits out of us
i believe we forgot everything except ofcourse personal fear and its eem edt owi pet he slate clean and give us afresh start
we had a capital 's ever et ea ' at robinhood 's bay in a sweet little old fashioned in nwi thabo wwi nd owr ight over the seaweed covered rocks of the strand
i believe we should have shocked the ' new woman ' with our appetites
men are more tolerant bless the m
the nwe walked home with some or rather many stoppages to rest and with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls
lucy was really tired and we intended to creep of fto be dass oona sweco uld
the young curate came in however and mrs
westenra asked him to stay for supper
lucy and i had both a fight for it with the dust ym iller
iknow it was a hard fight on my part and i am quite heroic
it hink that someday the bishops must get together and see about breeding up an ew class of curates who do n't takes up per no matter how hard they may be pressed to and who will know when girls are tired
lucy is asleep and breathing softly
she has more colour in her cheeks than usual and looks oh so sweet
if mr
holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing room iwon der what he would say if he saw her now
some of the ' new women ' writers will someday start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see eachother asleep before proposing or accepting
but is up pose the ' new woman ' won't condescend in future to accept
she will do the proposing herself
and an ice jobs he will make of it to o
the re 's some consolation in that
iams oh app yto night because dear lucy seems better
ire all ybe lieve she has turned the corner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming
is hould be quite happy if i only knew if jonathan
god bless and keep him

suddenly i became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fear upon mean do fso me feeling of emptiness around me
the room was dark soic ould not see lucy 's bed

the bed was empty

the door was shut but not locked as i had left it
if eared to wake her mother who has been more than usual ly ill lately so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her

finally icam et othe hall door and found it open
it was not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught

what it was whether manor beast ico uld not tell

the time and distance seemed endless and my knees trembl edan dmy breath came labour edas it oiled up the endless steps to the abbey

and something raised ahead and from where i was ico uld see a white face and red gleaming eyes
lucy did not answer and iran on to the entrance of the church yard
asien tered the church was between mean dthe seat and for a minute or soil osts ight of her
when i came in view again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat
she was quite alone and the rewa snot as i gno fan yli vingt hing about
when i bent over her ico uld see that she was still asleep
her lips were part edan dsh ewa sbr eat hing not softly as usual with her but in long heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath

when i had her carefully wrapped up iput my shoes on her feet and the nbe gan very gently to wake her
at first she did not respond but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighing occasionally
atlas tas time was passing fast and for many other reasons i wish edt oge the rhome at once is hook her for cib lyt ill finally she opened her eyes and awoke
she did not seem surprised to see me as ofcourse she did not realize all at once where she was

she trembl eda little and clung to me
when it old her to come at once with me home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child
as we passed along the gravel hurt my feet and lucy notice dme wince
she stopped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but i would not
however when we got to the pathway outside the church yard where the rewa sap ud dle of water remaining from the storm ida ube dmy feet with mud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home noone in case we should meet anyone should not icem yba ref eet

my heart beats olo udall the time sometimes it hough tish ould faint

before falling asleep she asked even implored men otto say a word to anyone even her mother about her sleepwalking adventure

ihave locked the door and the key is tied to my wrists oper haps is hall not be again disturbed
lucy is sleeping soundly
the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea
same day noon
all goes well
lucy slept till i woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side
the adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited her for she looks better this morning than she has done for weeks
iwas sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety pin hurt her
indeed it might have been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced

we passed a happy day
the air was clear and the sunbright and the rewa saco olb re eze
we took our lunch to mulgrave woods mrs
westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the cliff path and joining her at the gate
if elta little sad myself for ico uld not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had jonathan been with me
but there
imus to nly be patient
in the evening west rolled in the casino terrace and heard some good music by spohr and mackenzie and went to be dearly
lucy seems more restful than she has been for sometime and fell asleep at once
is hall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though i do not expect any trouble tonight
august
my expectations were wrong for twice during the night iwas wakened by lucy trying to get out
she seemed even in her sleep to be alittle impatient at finding the doors hut and went back to be dun deras or to fpr otes t
i woke with the dawn and heard the birds chirping outside of the window
lucy woke to oand iwas glad to see was even better than on the previous morning
all her old gaiety of manners eem edt oh avec ome back and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about arthur

well she succeeded somewhat for though sympathy can ' tal ter facts it can make the mmo re bearable
august
another quiet day and to be dwi tht he key on my wrist as before
again i awoke in the night and found lucy sitting up in bed still asleep pointing to the window
i got up quietly and pulling aside the blind looked out
it was brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky merged together in one great silent mystery was beautiful beyond words
between mean dthe moonlight flitted agreat batco ming and going in great whirling circles
once or twice it came quite close but was isup pose frightened at seeing mean dfl it ted away across the harbour towards the abbey
when i came back from the window lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully
she did not stir again all night
august
onthe east cliff reading and writing all day
lucy seems to have become a smu chin love with the spot asia man dit is hard to get her away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner
this afternoon she made a funny remark
we were coming home for dinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and stopped to look at the view as we generally do
the settings unl owd own inthe sky was just dropping behind kettle ness
the redlight was thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow
we were silent for awhile and suddenly lucy murmured as if to herself
his redeye saga in
the yare just the same
it was such an odd expression coming apropos of nothing that it quite start led me
isle wed round alittle so as to see lucy well with out seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a half dream yst at ewi than odd look on her face that i could not quite make out so i said nothing but followed her eyes
she appeared to be looking over at our own seat where on was a dark figure seated alone
iwas quite a little star tled myself for its eem edf or an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flame sbu tas econ dlo ok dispelled the illusion
the red sunlight was shining on the windows of st
mary 's church behind our seat and as the sun dipped the rewa sju sts uffici ent change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved
ical led lucy 's attention to the peculiar effect and she became herself with a start but she looked sad all the same
it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up the re
we never refer to its ois aid nothing and we went home to dinner
lucy had ahead ache and went early to be d
is a wheras lee pan dwe nto utf oral it tle stroll myself
i walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweets adness for iwas thinking of jonathan
when coming home itwas the nbr ight moonlight so bright that thought he front of our part of the crescent was in shadow everything could be well seen it hr ewa glance up at our window and saw lucy 's head leaning out
iop ened my handkerchief and waved it
she did not notice or make any movement whatever
just the nth emo on light crept round an angle of the building and the light fell on the window
the red is tinct ly was lucy with her head lying up against the side of the windows ill and here yes shut
she was fast asleep and by her seat edon the windows ill was something that looked like a good sized bird
iwasa fraid she might get a chill so i ran upstairs but as icam ein to the rooms he was moving back to her bed fast asleep and breathing heavily
she was holding her hand to her throat as though top rote cti ffr omt he cold

august
rose later than usual
lucy was languid and tired and slept on after we had been called
we had a happy surprise at breakfast
arthur 's father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon
lucy is full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once
later on inthe days he told me the cause
she is grieved to lose lucy asher very own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have someone to protect her
poor dear sweet lady
she confided to me that she has got her death warrant
she has not to ldl uc yand made me promise secrecy
her doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die for her heart is weakening
at anytime even now as ud den shock would be almost sure to kill her
ah we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of lucy 's sleepwalking

last night if ound her leaning out when i woke up and when it ried to wake her ico uld not

when i managed to restore her she was weak as water and cried silently between long painful struggles for breath

if she were in anyway anemic ico uld understand it but she is not
she is in gays piri tsa ndf ull of life and cheerfulness

strange and sudden change in renfield lastnight
about eight o'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting
the attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interest in him encouraged him to talk
he is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile button ight the mantel lsm ehe was quite haughty
would not condescend to talk with him at all
all he would say was id on ' twa ntt otal kto you
you do n't count now
the master is a than d
the attendant think siti sso me sudden for mof religious man i awh ich has seized him
if so we must look out for squalls for astron gman with homicidal and religious man iaa to nce might be dangerous
the combination is a dreadful one
at nine o'clock ivis it ed him myself
his attitude to me was the same as that tothe attendant
in his sublime self feeling the difference between myself and the attendant seemed to him as nothing
it looks like religious man iaa nd he will soon think that he himself is god
the sein finite sima ldist in ctions between man and man are too paltry for an omnipotent being
how the sema dme ngi vet he msel vesa way
the real god take thhe ed lest as parr owf all
but the god created from human vanity see sno difference between an eagle and as parr ow
oh if menon lyk new
for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree
id id not pretend to be watching him but i kept strict observation all the same
all at once that shift yl ook came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with it the shift ym ove men to fthe head and back which asylum attendants come to know sowell
he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resigned lya nd looked into space with lackluster eyes
it hough ti would find out if his apathy were real or only assume dan dtr ie dto lead him to talk of his pets at heme which had never failed to excite his attention
at first he made noreply but at length said test il y bother them all
id on ' tca reap in about the m
what
is a id
you do n't meant otel lme you do n't care about spiders
spider sat present are his hobby and the notebook is filling up with columns of small figures
to this he answered enigmatic all ythe bride maiden sre joice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride
but when the bride draweth night he nthe maiden ssh in eno tto the eyes that are filled
he would not explain himself but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time irem aine dwi th him
iam wear yto night and low in spirit s
icann otb utt hink of lucy and how different things might have been
if i do n't sleep at once chloral the modern morpheus
imus tbe careful not to let it grow into a habit
no isha llt aken one tonight
ihave thought of lucy and is hall not dishonour her by mixing the two
if need be tonight shall be sleepless
later
glad i made the resolution glad der that i kept to it
i had lain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when the night watchman came to me sent up from the war dto say that renfield had escaped
it hr ewo nm ycl othe sandra nd own at once
my patient is to oda nger ousa person to be roaming about
those ideas of his might work out dangerous ly with strangers
the attendant was waiting for me
he said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his bed when he had looked through the observation trap in the door
his attention was called by the sound of the window being wrenched out
her an back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had a ton ces ent up for me
he was only in his night gear and can not be far off
the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building bythe door
he is a bulky man and could n't get through the window
iam thin so with his aid igo to utb utf eet foremost and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt
the attendant to ldm ethe patient had gone to the left and had taken as trai ght lines oira nas quickly as i could
as i got through the belt of trees is a waw hit efi gures cale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the desert ed house
iran back at once told the watchman to get three or four men immediately and follow me into the ground so fcar fax incase our friend might be dangerous
i got a ladder myself and crossing the wall dropped down on the other side
ico uld see renfield 's figure just disappear in gbe hind the angle of the house so i ran after him
onthe farside of the house if ound him press edc lose against the old ironbound oak door of the chapel
he was talking apparently to someone but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lest i might frighten him and he should runoff
chasing a nerr an tsw arm of bees is not hing to follow in gana ked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him
after a few minutes however ico uld see that he did not take note of anything around him and so venture dto drawn ear ert ohim the more so as my men had no wcr oss edt he wall and were closing him in
i heard him say
iam here to do you rbi ddi ngm aster
iam your slave and you will reward me for isha llb efa it hf ul
ihave worshipped you long and afar off
now that you are near iawa it your command sandy ou will not pass me by will you dear master in your distribution of good thing s
he is a selfish old beggar anyhow
he thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in area lpr ese nce
his mania sma keast art ling combination
when we closed in on him he fought like a tiger
he is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man
in ever saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and ihop eis hall not again
it is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time
with strength and determination like his hemi ght have done wild work before he was caged
he is safe now at any rate
jack sheppard himself could n't get free from the strait waistcoat that keeps him restrained and he 's chained to the wall in the padded room
his cries are at times awful but the silence sth at follow are more deadly still for heme an smu rder in every turn and movement
just now he spoke coherent words for the first time
is hall be patient master
it is coming coming coming
so it ook the hint and came to o

if ound my dear one oh so thin and pale and weak looking
all the resolution has gone out of his dear eyes and that quiet dignity which it old you was in his face has vanished
he is only a wreck of himself and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for along time past
atleast he wants me to believe so and is hall never ask
he has had some terrible shock and if ear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it
sister agatha who is a good creature and aborn nurse tells me that he wanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herself and says he would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of god and that if an urs eth rough her vocation should hear the msh esh ould respect her trust
she is a sweet goods oul and the next day when she saw iwas trouble dsh eop ened up the subject again and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about added ' icant elly out his much my dear that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to be haven ocau set obe concerned
he has not forgotten you or what he owes to you
his fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal can treat of
' id obe lieve the dears oul thought i might be jealous lest my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl
the idea of my being jealous about jonathan
and yet my dear let me whisper if elta thrill of joy through me when i knew that no other woman was a cause for trouble
iam now sitting by his bedside where i can see his face while he sleeps
he is waking
when he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get something from the pocket
ias keds is tera gath aand she brought all his things

the nhe called me back and he said to me very solemn ly ' wilhelmina ' i knew the nth at hew asin deadly earnest for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him ' you know dear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife

she has come and told me that the chaplain of the english mission church has been sent for
we are to be married in an hour or as soon after a sjo nathan awake s
lucy the time has come and gone
if eelv ery solemn but very very happy
jonathan woke alittle after the hour and all was ready and he sat up in bed propped up with pillows
he answered his ' iwill ' firmly and strong
ico uld hardly speak
my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me
the dears is ters were so kind
please go dish all never never forget the mno rthe grave and sweet responsibilities ihave taken upon me
imus tte lly ou of my wedding present
when the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband oh lucy it is the first time ihave written the words 'm yh usb and ' left me alone with my husband it ook the book from under his pillow and wrapped it up in whitepaper and tied it with alittle bit of pale blue ribbon which was round my neck and sealed it over the knot with sealing wax and for my seal ius edm yw edding ring
the niki ssed it and showed it to my husband and told him that iwould keep it so and the nit would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trust edea cho the rth at iwould never open it unless it were for his own dear sake or for the sake of some stern duty
the nhe to ok my hand in his and oh lucy it was the first time he took his wife 's hand and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would go through all the past again to win it if need be
the poor dear meant to have said apart of the past but he can not think of time yet and is hall not wonder if at first hemi xes up not only the month but the year
well my dear what could is a y
ico uld only tell him that i was the happiest woman in all the wide world and that i had nothing to give him except myself mylife and my trust and that with the sew ent my love and duty for all the day so fm yli fe

the case of renfield grows even more interesting
he has now sofa rq uie ted that the rear espe lls of cessation from his passion
for the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent
the non en ight just as the moon rose hegre wq uie tan dke ptm urm uring to himself
now i can wait
now i can wait
the attendant came to tell me so i ran down at once to have a look at him
he was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gone from his face and his eyes had something of the iro ldp leading
i might almost say cringing softness
iwas satisfied with his present condition and directed him to be relieved
the attendant she sit at edb utf in all yca rri edo utm yw is he swith out protest
it was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see the ird is trust for coming close to me he said in a whisper all the while looking furtively at the mthe yth in kic ould hurt you
fancy me hurting you
the fools
it was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself disassociated even in the mind of this poor madman from the other sbu tall the same id on otf oll ow his thought
amit ota kei tth at ihave anything in common with him so that we are as it were to stand together
or has he toga in from me some good so stupendous that my wellbeing is needful to him
imus tfi nd out later on
tonight he will not speak
event he offer of a kitten or even a full grown cat will not tempt him
he will only say i do n't take any stock in cats
ihave more to think of now and ican wait
ican wait
after awhile i left him
the attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn and that the nhe began to get uneasy and at length violent until atlas the fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma
three nights has the same thing happened violent all day the nq uie tfr omm oon rise to sunrise
i wish i could get some clue to the cause
it would almost seem as if the rewa sso mein fluence which came and went
happy thought
we shall tonight plays an ew its against madone s
he escaped before without our help
tonight he shall escape with it
we shall give him achan cea nd have the men ready to follow in case the yare required
august
the expected always happens
how well disraeli knew life
our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all our subtle arrangements were for nought
at any rate wehave proved one thing that the spells of quietness last areas on a ble time
we shall in future beable to ease his bonds for a few hours each day
ihave given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room when once he is quiet until the hour before sunrise
the poor soul 's body will enjoy the relief even if his mind can not appreciate it
hark
the unexpected again
iam called
the patient has once more escaped
later
another night adventure
renfield artfully waited until the attendant was entering the room to inspect
the nhe dashed out past him and flew down the passage
is ent word for the attendant sto follow
again he went into the ground soft he deserted house and we found him in the same place press eda gains tthe old chapel door
when he saw me he became furious and had not the attendant sse ized him in time he would have tried to kill me
as we were holding him as trang eth in gha ppe ned
he suddenly redoubled his efforts and the nass ud den ly grew calm
ilo ok ed round instinctively but could see nothing
the nic aug htt hepa tient 's eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlight skye xc ept abi gba twh ich was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west
bats usually wheel about butt his one seemed to go straight on a sif it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own
the patient grew calmer every instant and present lys a id you need n't tie me
is hall go quietly
without trouble we came back to the house
if eel the reiss ome thing ominous in his calm and shall not forget this night

atthe sametime iam not by any means satisfied with her appearance
she is woefully different from what she was when i saw her last
ofcourse you must be a rin mind that i did not have full opportunity of examinations uch as is hould wish
our very friendship makes alittle difficult yw hich not even medical science or custom can bridge over
i had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you to draw in a measure your own conclusions
is hall the nsa yw hat ihave done and proposed oing
if ound miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits
her mother was present and in a few seconds imad eupm ymin dth at shew as trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious
ihave no doubt she guesses if she does not know what need of caution there is
we lunch eda lone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful we got a sso me kind of reward for our labour sso mere alch eerf uln essam on gst us
the nmr s
westenra went to lie down and lucy was left with me
we went into her boudoir and till we got the re her gaiety remained for the servants were coming and going
as soon as the door was closed however the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand
when i saw that he rhi ghs piri tsh adfa ile dia to nce to oka dva nta geo fhe rre action to make a diagnosis
she said to me very sweet ly ' icann otte lly ou how i loathe talking about myself
' irem in de dhe rth at a doctor 's confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her
she caught on to my meaning at once and settled that matter in a word
' tell a rth ure very thing you choose
id on otc are for myself but for him
's oia mq uite free
ico uld easily see that she was somewhat bloodless but i could not see the usual anemic signs and bythe chance iwasa ble to test the actual quality of her blood for in opening a window which was stiff acord gave way and she cut her hands lightly with broken glass
it was a slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and is ecu red afew drops of the blood and have analysed the m
the qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition and shows is hould in feri nits elf avi go rous state of health
in other physical matter siwa squ it esat is fied that the reis none edf or anxiety but as the remus tbe aca use somewhere ihave come to the conclusion that it must be something mental
she complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily at times and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her but regarding which she can remember nothing
she says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep and that when i nw hit by the habit came back and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff where miss murray found her
but she assures me that of late the habit has not returned
iam in doubt and so have done the best thing i know of
ihave written to my old friend and master professor van helsing of amsterdam who knows as much about obscured is eases as anyone in the world
ihave asked him to come over and as you to ldm eth at all things were to be at your charge ihave mentioned to him who you are and your relations to miss westenra
this my dear fellow is in obedience to your wishes for iam only to opr oud and happy to do anything ican for her
van helsing would iknow do anything for me for a personal reasons on oma tter on what ground he comes we must accept his wishes
he is a seemingly arbitrary man this is because he knows what he is talking about better than anyone else
he is a philosopher and amet a physician and one of the most advanced scientists of his day and he has ibe lieve an absolutely open mind
this with an iron nerve at emp ero fthe ice brook and indomitable resolution self command and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and the kind lies tan dtr ues the art that beats the sef or mhi seq uip men tfor the noble work that he is doing for mankind work both in the ory and practice for his views are as wide as his all embracing sympathy
it elly out he sef acts that you may know why i have such confidence in him
ihave asked him to come at once

she is to meet me at the store sso that i may not alarm her mother by too early are petition of my call

van helsing made avery careful examination of the patient
heist or eport to mean dish all advise you for ofcourse iwas not present all the time
he is if ear much concerned but says he must think
when it old him of our friends hip and how you trust to me in the matter he said ' you must tell him all you think
tell him what it hink ifyou can guess it ifyou will
nay iam not jesting
this is no jest but life and death perhaps more
' ias ked what he meant by that for he was very serious
this was when we had come back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to amsterdam
he would not give me any further clue
you must not be angry with me art because his very reticence means that all his brain sare working for her good
he will speak plainly enough when the time comes be sure
so it old him iwould simply write a nacc ount of our visit just as if i were doing a descriptive special article for the daily telegraph
he seemed not to notice but remarked that the smuts of london were not quite so bad as the yu sed to be when he was a student here
iam to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it
in any case iam to have a letter
well as to the visit lucy was more cheerful than on the day if i rst saw her and certainly looked better
she had lost something of the ghastly look that soups et you and her breathing was normal
she was very sweet to the professor ass heal ways is an dtr ie dto make him feel at ease though i could see the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it
i believe van helsing saw it to ofori saw the quicklook under his bush yb rows that i knew of old
the nhe began to chat ofall things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite genial it yth at ico uld see poor lucy 's pretense of animation merge into reality
the nwi thou tan ys eem in gch an gehe brought the conversation gently round to his visit and suave lys a id 'm yd ear young miss ihave the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved

' and he snapped his fingers at mean dwe nto n
' but you and is hall show the mho wwr on gthe yare
how can he ' and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which he pointed me out in his class on or rather after apart icu larocca sion which he never fails to remind me of ' know anything of a young ladies
he has his madmen to play with an dto bring the mba ckt oh appin essa ndt otho set hat love the m
it is much to do and oh but there are rewards in that we can be stows uch happiness
but the young ladies

zoo pha go us patients till keeps up our interest in him
he had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time
just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless
the attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned a id
fortunately the men came at a run and were just in time for a tthe stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all the irs treng tht oh old him
in about five minutes however he began to get more quiet and finally san kint oas or to fme lan chol yin which state he has remained upton ow
the attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling
if ound my hands full when i got in attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him
indeed ican quite understand the effect for the sound sdi stu rbe dev en met hough iwas some distance away
it is now after the dinner hour of the asylum and as yet my patients its in acorn erb rood in gwi thad ull sullen woe begone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly
icann ot quite understand it
later
another change in my patient
at five o'clock ilo ok edin on him and found him seemingly as happy and content edas he used to be
he was catching flies and eating the man dwa skee ping not eof his capture by making nail marks on the edge of the door between the ridge so fpa ddi ng
when he saw me he came over and apologized for his bad conduct and asked me in avery humble cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his notebook again
it hough tit well to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open
he has the sugar of his tea spread out on the windows ill and is reaping quite a harvest of flies
he is not now eating the mbu tput ting the mint oab oxa so fold and is already examining the corner so fhi sro omt of in das pid er
it ried to get him to talkabout the past few days for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would not rise
for a moment or two helo ok ed very sad and said in a sort of faraway voice as though saying it rather to himself than to me
all over
all over
he has deserted me
no hope for men owu nle ssid oit myself
the nsu dde nly turning to me in a resolute way he said doctor won't you be very good to mean dle tme have a little more sugar
it hink it would be very good for me
and the flies
is a id
yes
the flies like it to oand il ike the flies therefore i like it
and the rear epe opl ewh ok now so little as to think that madmen donot argue
ipro cured him a double supply and left him as happy amana sisu ppos ean yin the world
i wish i could fathom his mind
midnight
another change in him
i had been to see miss westenra who mi found much better and had just returned and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when once more ihe ard him yelling
as his room is on this side of the house ico uld hear it better than in the morning
it was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over london with its lurid lights and in ky shadows and all the marvellous tints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water and to realize all the grim sternness of my own coldstone building with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heart to endure it all
ire ached him just as the sun was going down and from his window saw the red discs in k
as it sank he became less and less frenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that he ldh imani ner tmas son the floor
it is wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood up quite calm lya nd looked around him
is ign all edt othe attendants not to hold him for iwasa nxi oust ose ewha the would do
he went straight over to the window and brushed out the crumbs of sugar
the nhe to ok his fly box and emptied it outside and threw away the box
the nhes hutt he window and crossing over sat down on his bed
all this surprised me so i asked him are you going to keep flies anymore
no said he
iams ick of all that rubbish
he certainly is a wonderful lyin teresting study
i wish i could get some glimpse of his mind or ofthe cause of his sudden passion
stop
the rema ybe aclu eaf tera lli fwe can find why today his paroxysms came on a thigh noonan datsuns et
can it be that the reis am align influence of the sun at periods which affects certain nature sasa tti mest he moon does others

chapter letter dr
seward to hon
arthur holmwood september my dear art my news today is not so good
lucy this morning had gone back abit
the reis however one good thing which has arisen from it
mrs
westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy and has consulted me professional lya bout her
it ook advantage of the opportunity and told her that my old master van helsing the great specialist was coming to stay with mean dth at iwould put her in his charge conjointly with myself
sono wwe can come and go without alarming her unduly for a shock to her would mean sudden death and this in lucy 's weak condition might be disastrous to her
we are hedge din with difficulties all of us my poor fellow but please go dwes hall come through the mall right
if any need is hall write so that if you do not hear from meta kei tfor granted that i am simply waiting for new sinha ste your sever john seward dr
seward 's diary september
the first thing van helsing said to me when we met at liverpool street was have you said anything to our young friend to love rof her
no isa id
iwai ted till i had seen you as is a idi nm yt ele gram
i wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming as miss westenra was not sowell and that is hould let him know if need be
right my friend he said
quite right
better he not know as yet
perhaps he will never know
ipra yso but if it be needed the nhes hall know all
and my goodfriend john let me caution you
you deal with the madmen
all men are mad in some way or the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with god 's madmen to other est ofthe world
you tell not your madmen what you do nor why you do it
you tell them not what you think
soyo us hall keep knowledge in its place where it may rest where it may gather it skin dar ound it and breed
you and is hall keep as yet what we know here and here
he touched me on the heart and onthe forehead and the nto uche dhi msel fthe same way
ihave for myself though tsa tthe present
later is hall unfold to you
why not now
ias ked
it may do some good
we may arrive at some decision
he looked at mean dsa id my friend john when the corn is grown even before it has ripened while the milk of its mother earth is in him and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his gold the husband man he pull the ear and rub him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaff and say to you ' look
he 's good corn he will make a good crop when the time comes
' id id not see the application and told him so
for reply here ached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully as he used long ago to do at lectures and said the good husband mantell you so the nbe cause he knows but not till the n
but you do not find the good husband man dig up his plan ted corn to see if he grow
that is for the children who play at husband ryan dno tfor those who take it as of the work of the irl if e
see you now friend john
ihave sown my corn and nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at all the re 's some promise and iwai tti llt he ear begins to swell
he broke off for he evidently saw that i understood
the nhe went on gravel yy ou were always a careful student and your case book was ever more full than the rest
and it rust that good habit have not fail
remember my friend that knowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weaker
even if you have not kept the good practice let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that maybe mind is a yma ybe of such interest to usando the rst hat all the rest may not make him kick the beam as you rpe opl esa y
take the ngo odn ote of it
nothing is to osm all
ico uns ely ouput down in record even your doubts and surmises
hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess
we learn from failure not from success
when i described lucy 's symptoms the same as before but infinitely more marked he looked very grave but said nothing
he took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a professor of the healing craft
when we were shown in mrs
westenra metus
she was alarmed but not nearly so much as i expected to find her
nature in one of her benefi cient moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terror s
here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from some cause or other the things not personal event heter rib lech an gein her daughter to whom she is so attached donots eem to reach her
it is something like the way dame nature gathers round afore ign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact
if this bean ordered selfishness the nwe should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for the rema ybe deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of
i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual path ology and set down a rule that she should not be present with lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required
she assented readily sore adil yth at isa waga in the hand of nature fighting for life
van helsing and i were shown up to lucy 's room
if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday i was horrified when i saw her today
she was ghastly chalk il ypa le
the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bones of her face stood out prominently
her breathing was painful to see or hear
van helsing 's face grew set as marble and his eyebrows converged till the yal most touched over his nose
lucy lay motionless and did not seem to have strength to speak so for awhile we were all silent
the nva nh elsi ngb ecko ned to mean dwe went gently out of the room
the instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door which was open
the nhep ull edme quickly in with him and closed the door
my god
he said
this is dreadful
the reis not time to be lost
she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart 's action as it should be
the remus tbe at ran sfu sion of blood at once
is it you or me
iam younger and stronger professor
it must be me
the nget ready at once
iwill bring up my bag
iam prepared
i went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the hall door
when we reached the hall them aid had just opened the door and arthur was stepping quickly in
her us he dup to me saying in an eager whisper jack iwas so anxious
ire adbe tween the lines of your letter and have been in an agony
the dad was better so i ran down here to see for myself
isnot that gentleman dr
van helsing
iams otha nkf ult oyo us irf or coming
when first the professor 's eye had lit up on him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took in his stalwart proportion sand recognized the strong young man hood which seemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed
without a pause he said to him as he held out his hands ir you have come in time
you are the love rof our dear miss
she is bad very very bad
nay my child donot go like that
for he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting
you are to help her
you can do more than any that live and your courage is your best help
what can i do
asked arthur hoarsely
tell me and is hall do it
mylife is her sand iwould give the last drop of blood in my body for her
the professor has astron gly humorous side and i could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer
my young sir id on ota sks om uch as that not the last
what shall id o
the rewa sfi rein his eyes and his open nostrils quivered within ten t
van helsing slapped him on the shoulder
come
he said
you are amana ndi tisa man we want
you are better than me better than my friend john
arthur looked bewildered and the professor went on by explaining in a kind ly way
young miss is bad very bad
she wants blood and blood she must have or die
my friend john and ihave consulted and wear eab out to perform what we call transfusion of blood to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which pine for him
john was to give his blood as he is the more young and strong than me
here arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence
but now you are here you are more good than us old or young who toil much in the world of thought
our nerves are not so calm and our blood so bright than your s
arthur turned to him and said if you only knew how gladly iwould die for her you would understand
he stopped with a sort of choke in his voice
good boy
said van helsing
in the not so far off you will be happy that you have done all for her you love
come now and be silent
you shall kiss her once before it is done but the ny oum us tgo and you must leave a tm ysi gn
say no word to madame
you know how it is with her
the remus tbe no shock any knowledge of this would be one
come
we all went up to lucy 's room
arthur by direction remained outside
lucy turned her head and looked at usb utsa id nothing
she was not asleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort
here yes spoke to us that was all
van helsing to oks ome things from his bag and laid the mona little table out of sight
the nhe mixed an arc otic and coming over to the beds aid cheerily now little miss her eis your medicine
drink it off like a good child
see il if tyo us otha tto swallow is easy
yes
she had made the effort with success
it astonished me how long the drug took to act
this infact marked the extent of her weakness
the time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in here yel ids
atlas thow ever the narcotic began to manifest its potency and she fell into a deep sleep
when the professor was satisfied he called arthur into the room and bad ehi mstr ipo ffh is coat
the nhe added you may take that one little kiss while sib ring over the table
friend john help to me
so neither of us looked whilst he bent over her
van helsing turning to me said he is so you ngan dst ron gand of blood so pure that we need not def ibr in a tei t
the nwi ths wif tness but with absolute method van helsing performed the operation
as the transfusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor lucy 's cheeks and through arthur 's growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine
after a bit ibe gant ogr owa nxi ous for the loss of blood was telling on arthur strong man as he was
it gave me an idea of what ater rib lest rain lucy 's system must have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her
but the professor 's face was set and he stood watch in hand and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur
ico uld hear my own heart beat
presently he said in a soft voice donots tiran instant
it is enough
you attend him
iwill look to her
when all was over ico uld see how much arthur was weakened
id res sed the wound and took his arm to bring him away when van helsing spoke with outturn inground the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head the brave love rith in kde serve another kiss which he shall have presently
and as he had no wfi nished his operation head just edt he pillow to the patient 's head
as he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat buckle dwi than old diamond buckle which he rlo ver had given her was dragged alittle up and showed are dma rko nh erth roa t
arthur did not notice it but i could hear the deep his sofi ndr a wn breath which is one of van helsing 's way so fbe tray in gem oti o n
he said nothing at the moment but turned to me saying now take down our brave young lover give him of the port wine and let him lie down awhile
he must then go home and rests lee pm uch and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love
he must not stay here
hold a moment
ima yt a kei tsi rth at you are anxious of result
the nbr in git with you that in all ways the operation is successful
you have saved her life this time and you can go home and resteasy in mind that all that can be is
is hall tell her all when she is well
she shall love you nonetheless for what you have done
goodbye
when arthur had gone i went back to the room
lucy was sleeping gently but he rbr eat hing was stronger
ico uld see the counter pane move as he rbr east heaved
by the bedside sat van helsing looking at her intent ly
the velvet band again covered the red mark
ias ked the professor in a whisper what do you make of that mark on her throat
what do you make of it
ihave not examined it yet ian swer edan dthe nand the repro ceeded to loose the band
just over the external jugular vein the re were two punctures not large but not wholesome looking
the rewa sno sign of disease but the edges were white and worn looking as if by some tri tura tion
it at once occurred to me that that this wound or whatever it was might be the means of that manifest loss of blood
but i abandoned the idea as soon as it for me dfor such a thing could not be
the whole be dwo uld have been drenched to asca rle twit hthe blood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion
well
said van helsing
well said i
ican make nothing of it
the professor stood up
imus tgo back to amsterdam tonight he said the rear ebooks and things there which i want
you must remain here all night and you must not let you rsi ghtp as sfr omh er
shall ihave an urs e
ias ked
we are the best nurses you and i
you keep watch all night
see that she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her
you must not sleep all the night
later on we can sleep you and i
is hall be back as soon as possible
and the nwe maybe gin
maybe gin
is a id
what one art hd oyo umea n
we shall see
he answered as he hurried out
he came back am omen tla teran dput his head inside the door and said with a warning finger held up remember she is your charge
if you leave her and harm befall you shall not sleep easy hereafter
dr
seward 's diary continued september
is a tupa lln ight with lucy
the opiate worked itself off towards dusk and she wake dna tural ly
she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation
her spirits even were good and she was full of a happy vivacity but i could see evidence soft he absolute prostration which she had undergone
when it old mrs
westenra that dr
van helsing had directed that is hould situ pwi thhe rsh eal most pooh poohed the idea pointing out her daughter 's renewed strength and excellent spirits
iwas firm however and made preparations for my long vigil
when he rma id had prepared her for the night icam ein having inthe meantime had supper and took a seat by the bedside
she did not in anyway make objection but looked at me gratefully whenever i caught her eye
after along spells he seemed sinking of fto sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off
it was apparent that she did not want to sleep so it ack led the subject at once
you do not want to sleep
no
iam a fraid
afraid to go to sleep
why so
it is the boon we all crave for
ahn oti fy ou were like me if sleep was to you apres age of horror
apres age of horror
what one art hd oyo umea n
id on ' tkn ow
oh i do n't know
and that is what is so terrible
all this weakness comes to me in sleep until i dread the very thought
but my dear girl you may sleep tonight
iam here watching you and ican promise that nothing will happen
ahi can trust you
she said
is ei zed the opportunity and said ipro mise that if i see any evidence of bad dreams iwill wake you at once
you will
oh will you really
how good you are to me
the niw ills lee p
and almost at the words he gave a deep sigh of relief and sank back asleep
all night long iwa tche dby her
she never stirred but slept on and on in a deep tranquil life giving health giving sleep
her lips were slightly part edan dhe rbr east rose and fell with the regular it yof ape nd ulu m
the rewa sas mile on her face and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind
in the early morning her maid came and i left her in her care and took myself back home for iwasa nxi ousa bout many things
is ent as hort wire to van helsing and to arthur telling the mof the excellent result of the operation
my own work with its manifold arrears to ok meal lda yto clear of f
it was dark when i was able to inquire about my zoo pha go us patient
the report was good
he had been quite quiet for the past day and night
at el eg ram came from van helsing at amsterdam whilst i was a tdi nner suggesting that is hould beat hill in gha mto night as it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving bythe night mail and would join me early in the morning
september
iwas pretty tired and worn out when i got to hill in gha m
for two nights iha dhar dly had a wink of sleep and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion
lucy was up and in cheerful spirits
when she shook hands with mesh elook eds harp lyin my face and said no sitting up to night for you
you are worn out
iam quite well again
indeed iam and if the reis to be any sitting up itis i who will sit up with you

lucy westenra 's diary september
if eels oh app yto night
ihave been so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about is like feeling sunshine after along spell of east wind out of a steel sky
somehow arthur feels very very close to me

dr
seward 's diary september
iwas conscious of the professor 's hand on my head and started awake all in a second
that is one of the things that we learn in an asylum at any rate
and how is our patient
well when i left her or rather when she left me ian swer ed
come let us see hesa id
and together we went into the room
the blind was down and i went over to raise it gently whilst van helsing stepped with his soft catlike tread over to the bed
as i raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room ihe ard the professor 's low his sofi nspi ratio nand knowing it sra rity adea dly fears hot through my heart
as ipass edo ver he moved back and his exclamation of horror got tinh immel
needed no enforcement from his agonized face
her aise dhis hand and pointed to the bed and his iron face was drawn and ashen white
if elt my knees begin to tremble
the reon the beds eem in gly in a swoon lay poor lucy more horribly white and wan looking than ever
event heli psw ere white and the gums seemed to have shrunk enb ack from the teeth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness
van helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habits to odt ohim and he put it down again softly
quick
he said
bring the brand y
if lew to the dining room and return ed with the decanter
hewett edt he poor white lips with it and together we rubbed palm and wrist and heart
he felt her heart and after a few moments of agonizing suspense said it is not to olate
it beats though but feebly
all our work is undone
we must be gina gain
the reis no young arthur here now
ihave to call on you yourself this time friend john
ashes poke he was dipping into his bag and producing the instrument soft ran sfu sion
i had taken off my coat and rolled up my shirt sleeve
the rewa sno possibility of an opiate just a tpr ese nta ndn one edo fone and so without a moment 's delay web egan the operation
after a time it did not seem as hort time either for the draining away of one 's blood no matter how will ingly it be given is a terrible feeling van helsing held up a warning finger
donots tir he said
but if earth at with growing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger
but is hall precaution take
is hall give hypodermic injection of morph ia
he proceeded the nsw if tly and deftly to carry out his intent
the effect on lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to merge subtly into the narcotics lee p
it was with a feeling of personal pride that i could see a faint tinge of colours teal back into the pallid cheeks and lips
no man knows till he experience sit what it is to feel his own life blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves
the professor watched me critical ly
that will do hesa id
already
irem onstrated
you to oka great deal more from art
to which he smiled as a dso rto fsm ile a shere plied he is her lover her fiance
you have work much work to do for her and for other sand the present will suffice
when we stopped the operation heat tended to lucy whilst i applied digital pressure to my own incision
i laid down while i waited his leisure to attend to me for if elt faint and alittle sick
by and by hebo und up my wound and sent me downstairs to get a glass of wine for myself
as i was leaving the room he came after mean dhal fw his per ed
mind nothing must be said of this
if our young lovers hould turn up unexpected as before now or dto him
it would at once frighten him and en jealous him to o
the remus tbe none
so
when i came back helo ok eda tme carefully and the nsaid you are not much the worse
go into the room and lie on your sofa and rest awhile the nha vem uch breakfast and come here to me
if oll owed out his orders for ikn ewh owr ight and wise they were
i had done my part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength
if elt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred
if ella sleep on the sofa however wondering over and over again how lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it
it hink imus tha veco nti nued my wonder in my dreams for sleeping and waking myth ought salwa ysc am ebac kto the little punctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of the ire dge sti nyt hough the yw ere
lucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well and strong though not nearly so much so as the day before
when van helsing had seen her he went out for a walk leaving me incharge with strict injunction sth at iwas not to leave her for a moment
ico uld hear his voice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph office
lucy chatted with me free lya nds eem ed quite unconscious that anything had happened
it ried to keep her amused and interested
when he rmo the rca me up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever but said to me gratefully we owe you so much dr
seward for all you have done but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself
you are looking pale yourself
you want a wife to nurse and look after you abit that you do
as she spoke lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarily for her poor waste dve in sco uld not stand for long an unwonted drain to the head
the reaction came in excess ive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me
is mile dan dno dded and laid my finger on my lips
with a sigh she sank back amid her pillow s
van helsing returned in a couple of hours and present lys a idt omen ow you go home and eat much and drink enough
make your self strong

goodnight
in the hall two of the maids came to mean das ked ifthe yore it hero fthe mm ight not sit up with miss lucy
the yim plore dme to let them and when i said it was dr
van helsing 's wish that either he or is hould situ pthe yas ked mequite piteously to intercede with the ' foreign gentleman '
iwas much to uche dby the irk in dnes s
perhaps it is because i am weak at present and perhaps because it was on lucy 's account that the ird evo tion was manifested
for over and over again have is een similar instances of woman 's kindness
i got back here in time for a late dinner went my rounds all well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep
it is coming
september
this afternoon i went over to hill in gha m
found van helsing in excellent spirits and lucy much better
shortly after i had arrived abi gpa rce lfr oma broad came forth epr of esso r
he opened it with much impress me nt assumed ofcourse and showed a great bundle of white flowers
the sea ref or you miss lucy he said
for me
oh dr
van helsing
yes my dear but not for you to play with
the sea re medicine s
here lucy made a wry face
nay but the yare not to take in a decoction or in nauseous for mso you need not snub that socha rmin gnos eor is hall point out to my friend arthur what woes he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he solo vess om uch distort

oh yes
the yli ket he lotus flower make your trouble forgotten
it smells oli ket he water so flet he and of that fountain of youth that the conquistador esso ugh tfor in the florida sand find him all too late
whilst he was speaking lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling the m
now she threw the mdo wns ayin gwi th half laughter and half disgust oh professor ibe lieve you are only putting up a joke on me
why the sef lower sare only common garlic
to my surprise van helsing rose up and said with all his sternness his iron jaws etan dhis bush yey ebro wsm eeting not rifling with me
in ever jest
the reis grim purpose in what i do and iwar ny out hat you do not thwart me
take care for the sake of other sif not for your own

come with me friend john and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from haarlem where my friend vanderpool raise her bin his glasshouse sall the year
i had to telegraph yesterday or the yw ould not have been here
we went into the room taking the flowers with us
the professor 's actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopeia that i ever heard of
first he fastened up the windows and latched the msec ure ly
next taking a handful of the flowers her ubb edt he mall over the sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in would be laden with the garlic smell
the nwi tht he wisp her ubb eda llo vert he jambo fthe door above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way
it all seemed grotesque to mean dpr ese ntl yi said well professor iknow you always have area son for what you do but this certainly puzzles me
it is well wehave no sceptic here or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit
perhaps i am
he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which lucy was to wear round her neck
we then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck
the last words he said to her were take care you do not disturb it and even if the room feel close donot tonight open the window or the door
ipro mises aid lucy
and thankyou both at hous and times for all your kindness to me
oh what have ido net obe blessed with such friends
as we left the house in my fly which was waiting van helsing said tonight i can sleep in peace and sleep iwan ttwo night soft ravel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and an ight to sit up with out to win k

called at the berkeley and found van helsing asus ual upto time
the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting
the professor took his bag which he always brings with him now
let all be put down exactly
van helsing and i arrived at hill in gha mate ight o'clock
it was a lovely morning
the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature 's annual work
the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours but had not yet begun to drop from the trees
when we entered we met mrs
westenra coming out of the morning room
she is always an early riser
she greeted us warmly and said you will be glad to know that lucy is better
the dearch il diss till asleep
ilo ok edin to her room and saw her but did not goin lest i should disturb her
the professor smiled and looked quite jubilant
her ubb ed his hands together and said aha
it hough ti had diagnosed the case
my treatment is working
to which she replied you must not take all the credit to yourself doctor
lucy 's state this morning is due in part to me
how do you mean ma'am
asked the professor
well iwasa nxi ousa bout the dearch il dint henig htan dwe nti nto herroom
she was sleeping soundly so sound lyth at even my coming did not wake her
but the room was awfully stuff y
the re were alot of those horrible strong smell in gfl ower sabo ute very where and she had actually a bunch of the mro und her neck
if eared that the heavy odour would be too much for the dearch il dinh erw ea kst at eso it ook the mall away and opened a bit of the window to let in alittle fresh air
you will be pleased with her iams ure
she moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfast edea rly
as she had spoken iwa tche dthe professor 's face and saw it turn ashen gray
he had been able to retain his self command whilst the poor lady was present for he knew her state and how mischievous as hock would be
he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room
but the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and forcibly into the dining room and closed the door
the nfor the first time in my life is a wva nh elsi ngb re akd own
her aise dhis hands over his head in a sort of muted espa iran dthe nbe at his palms together in a helpless way
finally he sat down on a chair and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud dry so bst hats eem edt oco me from the very racking of his heart
the nhe raised his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe
god
god
god
he said
what have wed one what has this poor thing done that we are so sore beset
isthe ref at eamon gst us still send down from the pagan world of old that such things must be an din such way
this poor mother all unknowing and all for the best ass he think does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her we must not even war nh ero rsh edie the nbo thd ie
oh how we are beset
how are all the power soft he devils against us
suddenly he jumped to his feet
come he said come we must see and act
devils or node vil so rall the devil sat on cei tma tter snot
we must fight him all the same
he went to the hall door for his bag and together we went up to lucy 's room
once again id re wup the blind whilst van helsing went to ward sthe be d
this time he did not start a shel ook edon the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before
he wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity
as i expected he murmured with that his singin spira tion of his which meant so much
without a word he went and locked the door and the nbe gantos et out on the little table the instrument sfor yet another operation of transfusion of blood
i had long ago recognized the necessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with a warning hand
no
he said
today you must operate
is hall provide
you are weakened already
ashes poke he took off his coat and rolled up his shirt sleeve
again the operation
again the narcotic
again some return of colour to the ash ych eek sand there gular breathing of health ysl eep
this time i watched whilst van helsing recruited himself and rested
presently he took a no pport unit yof telling mrs
westenra that she must not remove anything from lucy 's room with out consulting him
that the flowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of the iro do urw as a part of the system of cure
the nhe to oko vert he care of the case himself saying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come
after another hour lucy wake dfr omh ers lee pfr esha ndb right and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal
what does it all mean
iam beginning to wonder if my long habit of life among stth eins an eis beginning to tell upon my own brain
lucy westenra 's diary september
four days and nights of peace
iam getting so strong again that i hardly know myself
it is a sif iha dpas sed through some long nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me
ihave adi mha lfr eme mbr an ceo flon gan xio us times of waiting and fearing darkness in which the rewa snot event hepa in of hope to make present distress more poignant
and the nlo ngs pell so fob livio nand the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water
since however dr
van helsing has been with me all this bad dream in gsee mst oh ave passed away
the noise sth at used to frighten me out of my wits the flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemed so close to me the harsh sounds that came from iknow not where and commanded me to do iknow not what have all ceased
i got obed now without any fear of sleep
id on ote vent ryt ok eep awake
ihave grown quite fond of the garlic and a box fula rri ves for me everyday from haarlem
tonight dr
van helsing is going away as he has to be for a day in amsterdam
but in eed not be watched
iam well enough to be left alone
thank god for mother 's sake and dear arthur 's and for all our friends who have been so kind
is hall not even feel the change for lastnight dr
van helsing slept in his chair alot of the time
if ound him as lee pt wic ewh en iaw ok e
but i did not fear to go to sleep again although the boughs or bats or something flapped almost angrily against the window panes

thomas and his wife are hospitable folk elderly and without children and if the specimen ie nj oye do fthe ir hospitality be ofthe average kind their lives must be pretty comfortable

just tell me how it happened and when i know the fact si 'll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end
all right guv ' no r
this ' ere is about the ' ole story
that ' ere wolf what we called be rsi cker was one of three gray one sth at came from norway to jam rach 's which we bought off him four years ago
he was an ice well behaved wolf that never gave not rouble total kof
i 'm more surprised at ' imf or want in ' to get out nora ny other animi lein the place

' e 's got mind in ' the animi less olo ngt hat blest if he ain ' tli kea old wolf ' is self
but there a in't no ' armin ' im
well sir it was about two hours after feed in ' yesterday when i first hear my disturbance
iwas makin ' up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma which is ill
but when i heard the yelp in ' and ' owl in ' ike mawa yst rai ght
the rewa sbe rsi cker at ear in ' like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out
the rewa sn ' tm uch people about that day and close at hand was only one man at all thin chap with a ' ook nose and apo in ted beard with a few white hair sru nni n't hr ough it
he had a ' ard cold look and redeye sand it ook as orto fmis like to him for its eem edas if it was ' imas the yw as hir rita ted at

' ' maybe it 's you 's a ysi for idi dno tli ket he air sash eg ive ' is self
he did n't get angry as i ' oped he would but he smiled akin do fins olen tsm ile with a mouthful lof white sharp teeth
' oh no they would n't like me '' esa ys
' ow yes they would 's a ysi aim it at in ' of him
' the yal ways like a bone or two to clean the irt eet hon about teatime which you ' as a bag ful
' well it was a odd thing but when the animi less ee usa talkin ' the yl a yd own and when i went over to be rsi cker he let me stroke his ears same as ever
that the reman kemo vera ndb less ed but if he did n't putin his hand and stroke the old wolf 's ears to o
' tyke care 's a ysi

' ' nevermind ' he says
i 'm used to 'em
' ' are you in the business yourself
' is a yst yk in goff my ' at for a man what trade sin wolves an cet ere risa goodfriend to keep ers

well lars tni ght so soon as the moon was hup the wolves here all began a ' owl in g
the rewa rn ' tno thing for the mto ' owl at
the rewa rn ' tno one near except someone that was evidently a call in ' ado gso me where so ut back of the garding sin the park road
once or twice i went out to see that all was right and it was an dthe nthe ' owl in gst opp ed
just before twelve o'clock i just took a look round afore turn in ' in an ' bust me but when i kemo ppos it et ool dbe rsi cker 's cage is eet her ails broken and twisted about and the cage empty
and that 's all iknow for cert in g
did anyone else see anything
one of our gard ' ners was a comin ' ' ome about that time from a ' armon yw he nhes ees abi ggr a yd ogc omi n ' out through the garding ' edges
atleast so he says but i do n't give much for it myself for if he did ' ene versa ida word about it to his miss is when ' ego t ' ome and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all night ahu nti n ' ofthe park for bers icke rth at her eme mber eds eei n'a nyt hing
my own belief was that the ' armon y ' ad got into his ' ead
now mr
bilder can you account in anyway for the escape of the wolf
well sir he said with a suspicious sort of modesty it hink ican but i do n't know as ' ow you 'd be satisfied with the theory
certainly is hall
if a man like you who knows the animals from experience can ' tha zar dago odg ues satan yr at ewh oise vento try
well then sir iacc ount sfor it this way
it seems to me that ' ere wolfe scape dsi mpl ybe cause he wanted to get out
from the heart yw ayth at both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke ico uld see that it had done service before and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell
ico uld n't cope in bad in a ge with the worthy thomas but it hough tik new asure rw ayto his heart so i said no wmr
bilder we 'll consider that first half sovereign worked of fan dth is brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you 've told me what you think will happen
right y ' are sir he said briskly
ye'll exco ose me iknow for a chaffin ' of ye but the old woman here winked at me which was a smu chaste lling met ogo on
well in ever
said the old lady
my opinion is this that ' ere wolf is a ' id in ' of somewhere s
the gard ' ner wot did n't remember said he was a gallop in ' northward faster than a horse could go but i do n't believe him for yers ees irw olv esd on ' tga llo pno more nord ogs does the ynot be in ' built that way
wolves is fine things in astor yb ook and ides say when the yg etsi npac ksa nd does be chi vy in 's ome thin ' that 's more afe are dth an the yi sthe yca nmake adev ilo fan oise and chop it up whatever it is
but lor ' bless you in real life awol fis only a low creature not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fight in ' im
this one ain ' tbe en used to fight in ' or even to provid in ' for his self and more like he 's somewhere round the park a ' hid in ' an ' a 's hive rin ' of an dif he thinks at all wonder in ' where he is to get his breakfast from
or maybe he 's got down some are a and is in a coal cellar
my eye won't some cook get a rums tart when she sees his green eyes as hin in ' at her out of the dark
if he can ' tge tfo odh e 's bound to look for it and may hap he may chance to light on a butcher 's shop in time
if he does n't and some nursemaid goes out walkin ' or or fwi tha soldier leavin ' ofthe hin fantin the per am bulat orwell the nis hould n't be surprised if the census is one babb ythe less
that 's all
iwas handing him the half sovereign when something came bobbing up against the window and mr
bilder 's face double dits natural length with surprise
god bless me
he said
if the rea in ' to ldb ers icke rco me back by ' is self
he went to the door and opened it amos tun necessary proceeding its eem edt ome
ihave always thought that a wild animal never look sso well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us
apers on alex perience has intensified rather than diminished that idea
after all however there is not hing like custom for neither bilder nor his wife thought anymore ofthe wolf than is hould of a dog
the animal itself was a peaceful and well behaved as that father of all picture wolves red riding hood 's quo nda mfr iend whilst moving her confidence in masquerade
the whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos
the wicked wolf that for a half a day had paralyzed london and set all the children into wns hiver in gint heirs hoes was the reina sort of penitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of vul pine prodigal son
old bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude and when he had finished with his penitents aid the reik new the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble
didn'ti say it all along
here 's his head all cut and full of broken glass
' e 's been age tti n ' over some bloomin ' wall or other
it'sa shy meth at people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles
this ' ere 's what comes of it
come along be rsi cker
he took the wolf and locked him up in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfied in quantity at any rate the elementary conditions of the fatted calf and went off to report
icam eof ft oot or eport the only exclusive information that is given to day regarding the strange escapade at the zoo

a whole night lost and iknow by bitter experience what may happen in an ight
ofcourse it is possible that all maybe we ll but what may have happened
surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us that every possible accidents hould thwart us in all wet ryt odo

memorandum left by lucy westenra september night
i write this and leave it to be seen so that noone may by any chance get into trouble through me
this is an exact record of what to ok place to night
if eel iam dying of weakness and have barely strength to write but it must be done if i die in the doing
i went to be das usual taking care that the flowers were placed as dr
van helsing directed and soon fell asleep
iwas wake dby the flapping at the window which had begun after that sleepwalking on the cliff at whitby when minas ave dme and which now iknow sowell
iwas not afraid but i did wish that dr
seward was in the next room as dr
van helsing said he would be so that i might have called him
it ried to sleep but i could not
the nth erec amet ome the old fear of sleep and ide termined to keep awake
perversely sleep would try to come the nw he nid id not want it
so as if eared to be alone iop ened my door and called out is the rea ny body there
the rewa sno answer
iwasa fraid to wake mother and so close dmy door again
the nout side in the shrubbery ihe arda sort of how lli kea dog 's but more fierce and deeper
i went to the window and looked out but could see nothing except abi gba twh ich had evidently been buffeting its wings against the window
so i went back to be daga in but determined not to go to sleep
presently the door opened and mother looked in
seeing by my moving that i was not asleep she came in and sat by me
she said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont iwas uneasy about you darling and came into see that you were all right
if eared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come in and sleep with me so she came into bed and laydown beside me
she did not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay awhile and the ngo back to her own bed
as she lay there in my arms and i inher sthe flapping and buffeting came to the window again
she was startled and alittle frightened and cried out what is that
it ried to pacify her and atlas tsu ccee de dan dsh ela yq uie t
but i could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly
after awhile there was the how laga in out in the shrubbery and shortly after the rewa sacra shatt he window and alot of broken glass was hurled on the floor
the window blind blew back with the wind that rushed in and in the aperture of the broken panes the rewa sthe head of agreat gaunt graywolf
mother cried out in a fright and struggled up into a sitting posture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her
amongst other things she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr
van helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck and to reit away from me
for a second or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and the rewa sastra nge and horrible gurgling in her throat
the nsh efe llo vera sif struck with lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two
the room and all round seemed to spin round
ike ptm yey esf i xed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a whole myriad of little specks seems to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when the reis as i moon in the desert
it ried to stir but there was some spell upon mean dde arm other 's poor body which seemed to grow cold already for her dear heart had ceased to be at weighed med own and irem ember edn omo ref or awhile
the time did not seem long but very very awful till i recovered consciousness again
somewhere near a passing bell was to lling
the dogs allround the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside an ight in gale was singing
iwas dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dead mother comeback to comfort me
the sound sse emed to have awakened the maids to ofori could hear the irb are feet pattering outside my door
ical led to the man dthe yca mein and when the ysa wwh at had happened and what it was that layover me on the bed the ysc reamed out
the wind rushed in through the broken window and the doors lamm edt o
the yli fte do fft he body of my dear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after i had got up
the yw ere all so frightened and nervous that idirect edt he mto goto the dining room and each have a glass of wine
the door flew open for an instant and closed again
the maids shrieked and the nwe nti nab ody to the dining room and i laid what flowers iha do nm yd ear mother 's breast
when the yw ere the re irem ember ed what dr
van helsing had to ldm ebu tid id n't like to remove the man dbes ides iwould have some of the servants to sit up with me now
iwas surprised that the maids did not come back
ical led the mbu tgo tno answers oi went to the dining room to look for the m
my heart sank when i saw what had happened
the yall four lay helpless on the floor breathing heavily
the decanter of sherry was on the table half full butt here was a queer acrid smell about
iwas suspicious and examined the decanter
it smelt of laudanum and looking on the sideboard if ound that the bottle which mother 's doctor uses for her oh
did use was empty

chapter dr
seward 's diary september
id rove at once to hill in gha mandar rived early
keeping my cab at the gate iw ent up the avenue alone
i knocked gently and ran gas quietly as possible for if eared to disturb lucy or her mother and hope dto only bring a servant to the door
after awhile finding no response ikn ock edan drang against ill no answer
icu rse dthe laziness of the servants that the ys hould lie abed at such an hour for it was now ten o'clock and so rangan dk no cked again but more impatient ly but still without response
hitherto iha dbl am edon lyth ese rva ntsb ut now at err ible fear began to assail me
was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight round us
was it indeed a house of death to which i had come to olate
iknow that minutes even seconds of delay might mean hours of danger to lucy if she had had again on eof those frightful relapse sand i went round the house to try if i could find by chance an entry anywhere
ico uld find no means of ingress
every window and door was fastened and locked and iret urn ed baffled to the porch
as i did so i heard the rapid pit pat of a swiftly driven horse 's feet
the yst opp eda tthe gate and a few seconds later imet van helsing running up the avenue
when he saw me he gasped out the nit was you and just arrived
how is she
are we tool at e
did you not get my telegram
ian swer edas quickly and coherently as i could that i had only got his telegram early in the morning and had not amin ute incoming here and that i could not make anyone in the house hear me
he paused and raised his hat ashes aids ole mn lyth en if ear wear et ool at e
god 's will be done
with his usual recuperative energy he went on come
if the rebe now a yop ent oge tin we must make one
time is all in all to us now
we went round to the back of the house where the rewa sakit chen window
the professor took a small surgical saw from his case and handing it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window
i attacked the maton cea nd had very soon cut through three of the m
the nwi thal on gth in knife we pushed back the fastening of the sashes and opened the window
i helped the professor in and followed him
the rewa sno one in the kitchen or in the servants ' rooms which were close at hand
we tried all the rooms as we went along and in the dining room dimly lit by ray so flight through the shutter sfo und four servant women lying on the floor
the rewa sno need to think the mdea dfor the irs tert or ous breathing and the acrid smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to the irc on dition
van helsing and ilo ok eda teach other and as we moved away he said we can attend to the mla ter
the nwea scen de dto lucy 's room
for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear
with white face sand trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered the room
how shall ides crib ewha twe saw
onthe be dla yt wow omen lucy and her mother
the latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a white sheet the edge of which had been blown back bythe drought through the broken windows how in gthe drawn white face with a look of terror fixed upon it
by her side lay lucy with face white and still more drawn
the flowers which had been round her neck we found upon her mother 's bosom and her throat was bare showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangled
without a word the professor be nto vert he bed his head almost touching poor lucy 's breast
the nhe gave a quick turn of his head as of one who listens and leaping to his feet he cried out to me it is not yet to olate
quick
quick
bring the brand y
if lewd own stairs and return ed with it taking care to smell and taste it lest it to ower ed rugged like the decanter of sherry which i found on the table
the maids were still breathing but more restless lya ndi fancied that the narcotic was wearing off
id id not stay to make sure but returned to van helsing
her ubb edt he brand yas on another occasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands
he said to me ican doth is all that can be at the present
you go wake those maids
flick the mint he face with a wet towel and flick the mha rd
make the mget heat and fire and a warm bath
this poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her
she will need be heated before we can do anything more
i went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the women
the fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly soil if ted her on the sofa and let her sleep
the other swer eda zed at first but as remembrance came back to the mthe yc ried and sobbed in a hysterical manner
iwas stern with the mho we vera nd would not let them talk
it old them that one life was bad enough to lose and if the yd ela ye dthe yw ould sacrifice miss lucy
so sobbing and crying the yw ent about the ir way half clad as the yw ere and prepared fire and water
fortunately the kitchen and boiler fire swer estill alive and the rewa sno lack of hot water
we got a bath and carried lucy out as she was an dpl ace dhe rini t
whilst we were busy chafing her limbs the rewa sak no cka tthe hall door
one of the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it
the nsh ere turned and whispered to us that the rewa sagent leman who had come with a message from mr
holmwood
i bade her simply tell him that he must wait for we could see noone now
she went away with the message and engrossed with our work icl ean for gota lla bout him
in ever saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest
i knew as he knew that it was a stand up fight with death and in a pause to ldh ims o
he answered me in a way that i did not understand but with the stern est look that his face could wear
if that were all iwould stop here where we are now and let her fadeaway into peace for is een oli ght in life over her horizon
he went on with his work with ifp ossi bler ene wed and more frenzied vigour
presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect
lucy 's heartbeat at rifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement
van helsing 's face almost beamed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hotsheet to dry her he said to me the first gain is our s
check to the king
we took lucy in to another room which had by now been prepared and laid her in bed and forced afew drops of brandy down her throat
in otice dth at van helsing tied as of tsi lkh and kerchief round her throat
she was still unconscious and was quite a sba das if not worse than we had ever seen her
van helsing called in one of the women and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes of fhe rti llw ere turned and the nbe cko ned me out of the room
we must consult a stow hat is to be done he said as we descended the stairs
in the hall he opened the dining room door and we passed in hec losing the door carefully behind him
the shutter shad been opened but the blind swer eal ready down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly observe s
the room was therefore dimly dark
it was however light enough for our purposes
van helsing 's sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity
he was evidently torturing his mind about something so i waited for an instant and he spoke
what are we todo now
where are we to turn for help
we must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girl 's life won't be worth a nho ur 's purchase
you are exhausted already
iam exhausted to o
if ear to trust those women even if the yw ould have courage to submit
what are we todo for someone who will open his veins for her
what 's the matter with mean yh ow
the voice came from the sofa across the room and its tones brought relief and joy to my heart for the yw ere those of quincey morris
van helsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as i cried out quincey morris
and rushed to ward shim without stretched hands
what brought you here
icri edas our hands met
i guess artist he cause
he handed me at el eg ram
' have not heard from seward for three days and am terribly anxious
can not leave
father still in same condition
send me word how lucy is
don otd ela y
holmwood
' it hink icam ejus tint he nick of time
you know you have only to tell me what to do
van helsing strode forward and took his hand looking him straight in the eyes as he said abra vem an 's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble
you 're amana ndn omis take
well the devil may work against us for all he 's worth but godsend sus men when we want them
once again we went through that ghastly operation
ihave not the heart to go through with the details
lucy had got a terrible shock and it to ldo nh erm or ethan before forth ough plenty of blood went into her veins her body did not respond to the treatment aswell as onthe other occasions
her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear
however the action of both heart and lungs improved and van helsing made as ubc utan eou sin jection of morph iaasb efore and with good effect
her faint became a profound slumber
the professor watched whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cab men who were waiting
ile ft quincey lying down after having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready ago odb re ak fast
the nath ought struck me and i went back to the room where lucy now was
when i came softly in if ound van helsing with a sheet or two of notepaper in his hand
he had evidently read it and was thinking it over ashes at with his hand to his brow
the rewa salo ok of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solved
he handed me the paper saying only it dropped from lucy 's breast when we carried her to the bath
when i had read it is to odl ooking at the professor and after a pause asked him in god 's name what does it all mean
was she or is she mad or what sort of horrible danger is it
iwas so bewildered that i did not know what to say more
van helsing put out his hand and took the paper saying donot trouble about it now
forget it for the present
you shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later
and now what is it that you came to me to say
this brought me back to fact and iwasa llm ys elf again
icam et osp ea kabo utt he certificate of death
if we do not act properly and wisely the rema ybe an inquest and that paper would have to be produced
iam in hopes that we need have no inquest for if we had it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else did
iknow and you know and the other doctor who attended her know sth at mrs
westenra had disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it
let us fill up the certificate at once and is hall take it myself to the registrar and go on to the undertaker
good ohm yf rien dj oh n
well thought of
truly miss lucy if she be sad in the foes that beset her is atleast happy in the friends that love her
one two three all open the irv eins for her besides one oldman
ah yes iknow friend john
iam not blind
ilove you all the more for it
now go
in the hall imet quincey morris with a telegram for arthur telling him that mrs
westenra was dead that lucy also had been ill but was now going on better and that van helsing and i were with her
it old him where i was going and he hurried me out but as i was going said when you comeback jack may ihave two words with you all too urs elves
in odd edin reply and went out
if ound no difficulty about the registration and arranged with the local undertake rto come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements
when i got back quincey was waiting for me
it old him iwould see him as soon as i knew about lucy and went up to her room
she was still sleeping and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side
from his putting his finger to his lips iga the red that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature
so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfast room where the blind swer en otdr awnd own and which was alittle more cheerful or rather less cheerless than the other rooms
when we were alone he said to me jack seward id on ' twa ntt osho vem ys elfin anywhere where i 've no right to be butt his is no ordinary case
you know ilove dth at girl and wanted to marry her but although that 's all past and gone ican ' the lpf eel in gan xio usabout her all the same
what is it that 's wrong with her
the dutchman and afin eol dfe llow he is ican see that said that time you two came into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhausted
now iknow well that you medical men speak in camera and that aman must not expect to know what they consult about in private
but this is no common matter and whatever it is ihave done my part
isnot that so
that 's so i said and he went on
it ake it that both you and van helsing haddon eal ready what i did today
isnot that so
that 's so
and i guess art was in it to o
when i saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer
ihave not seen anything pulled down so quick since i was on the pampas and had a mare that i was fond of goto grass all in an ight
one of those big bats that the yca ll vampires had got a the rint henig htan dwh at with his gorge and the vein left open the rewa sn ' ten ough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put a bullet through her ass hela y
jack ifyou may tell me without betraying confidence arthur was the first is not that so
ashes poket he poor fellow looked terribly anxious
he was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain
his very heart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of him and the rewa saro yall oto fit to oto keep him from breaking down
ipa used before answering for if elt that i must not be tray anything which the professor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessed so much that the reco uld be no reason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase
that 's so
and how long has this been going on
about ten days
tend a ys
the nig ues sja cks ewa rd that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins with in that time the blood of four strong men
manali veh erw hole body would n't hold it
the nco ming close to me he spoke in a fierce half whisper
what to oki to ut
is hook my head
that is a idis the crux
van helsing is simply frantic about it and i am at my wits ' end
ican ' tev en hazard ague ss
the reha sbe enas erie so flit tle circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to lucy being properly watched
but the ses hall not occur again
here west ayu nti lall be well or ill
quincey held out his hand
count me in hesa id
you and the dutchman will tell me what to do and i'll do it
when she woke late in the afternoon lucy 's first movement was to feel in her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which van helsing had given me to read
the careful professor had replaced it where it had come from lest on waking she should be alarmed
here yes then lit on van helsing and on me to oand gladdened
the nsh elook ed round the room and seeing where she was shuddered
she gave a loud cry and put her poor thin hands before her paleface
web oth understood what was meant that she had realized tothe full her mother 's death
so we tried what we could to comfort her
doubtless sympathy ease dhe rso me what but she was very low in thought and spirit and we pts ile ntl yand weakly for along time
we told her that either or both of us would now remain with her all the time and that seemed to comfort her
towards dusk she fell into a doze
here avery odd thing occurred
whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and to reit in two
van helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her
all the same however she went on with the action of tearing as though the material were still in her hands
finally she lifted her hands and opened the mast hough scattering the fragments
van helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered as if i nth ought but he said nothing
september
all lastnight she slept fitfully being always afraid to sleep and something weaker when she woke from it
the professor and it ook in turn stow at chan dwe never left her for a moment unattended
quincey morris said nothing about his intention but i knew that all night long hepa trolled round and round the house
when the day came its searching lights how edt her ava ges in poor lucy 's strength
she was hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to do her no good
at times she slept and both van helsing and in otice dthe difference in her between sleeping and waking
whilst asleep she looked strong eral though more haggard and her breathing was softer
her open mouth showed the pale gums drawn back from the teeth which looked positive ly longer and sharper than usual
when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently change dthe expression for she looked her own self although a dying on e
in the afternoon she asked for arthur and we telegraph edf or him
quincey went off to meet him at the station
when he arrived it was nearly six o'clock and the sun was setting full and warm and the redlight stream edin through the window and gave more colour to the pale cheeks
when he saw her arthur was simply choking with emotion and none of us could speak
in the hours that had passed the fits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it had grown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possible were shortened
arthur 's presence however seemed to act as a stimulant
she rallied alittle and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived
he too pulled himself together and spoke as cheerily as he could so that the best was made of everything
it is now nearly one o'clock and he and van helsing are sitting with her
iam to relieve the mina quarter of an hour and i am entering this on lucy 's phonograph
until six o'clock the yare to try to rest
if earth at tomorrow will end our watching for the shock has been too great

with regard to patient renfield the reis more to say
he has had another outbreak which might have had a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattended with any unhappy results
this afternoon acar rier 's car twit htw omen made a call at the empty house whose grounds abut on our sthe house to which you will remember the patient twice rana way
the men stopped at our gate to ask the porter the ir way as the yw eres trang ers
iwas myself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner and saw one of the mco me up to the house
as he passed the window of renfield 's room the patient began to rate him from within and called him all the foul names he could lay his tongue to
the man who seemed a decent fellow enough content ed himself by telling him to 's hut up for a foul mouthed beggar ' where on our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it
iop ened the window and signed to the man not to notice so he content ed himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of place he had got to by saying ' lor ' bless ye rsi riw ould n't mind what was said to me in a bloomin ' madhouse
ipit yy eand the guv ' no rfor havin ' to live in the house with a wild beast like that
' the nhe asked his way civil lye nough and it old him where the gate of the empty house was
he went away followed by threats and curses and reviling sfr omo urm an
i went down to see if i could make out any cause for his anger since he is usually such a well behaved man and except his violent fits nothing of the kind had ever occurred
if ound him to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner
it ried to get him to talk of the incident but he blandly asked me questions as to what i mean tan dled met obe lieve that he was completely oblivious of the affair
it was iams or ryt osa yh owe veron lya not her instance of his cunning for within half an hour ihe ardo fhi maga in
this time he had broken out through the window of his room and was running down the avenue
ical led to the attendant sto follow me and ran after him for if eared he was intent on some mischief
my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road having on its omeg re atwood enb ox es
the men were wiping the irf or ehe ads and were flushed in the face as if with violent exercise
before i could get up to him the patient rushed at the man dpu lling one of the mof fthe cart began to knock his head against the ground
if i had not seized him just a tthe moment i believe he would have killed the man there and the n
the other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt end of his heavy whip
it was a horrible blow but he did not seem to mind it but seized him also an dst rug gle dwi tht he three of us pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens
you know i am no lightweight and the other swer ebo thb url ym en
at first he was silent in his fighting but as we began to master him and the attendant swer epu tting astra it waistcoat on him he began to shout ' i'll frustrate the m
the ys han ' tro bme
the ys han ' tm urd erm eby inches
i'll fight for my lord and master
' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings
it was with very considerable difficulty that the ygo thi mba ckt othe house and put him in the padded room
one of the attendant shard yha daf in ger broken

some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to solove him that it really seems as though we had lost a father
in ever knew either father or mother so that the dear old man 's death is a real blow to me
jonathan is greatly distressed
it is not only that he feels so rro wde eps or row for the dear goodman who has befriended him all his life and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice but jonathan feels it on another account
he says the amount of responsibility which it puts up on him makes him nervous
he begins to doubt himself
it ryt oche erh im up and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself
but it is here that the graves hock that he experienced tells upon him the most
oh it is to oha rd that as we etsi mpl en obl est ron gnat ures uch as his anat ure which enabled him by our dear goodfriend 's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years should be so injured that the very essence of its strength is gone

seward 's diary september
only resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight
iam to omis erable to olo wsp irit edt oos ick of the world and all in it including life itself that iwould not care if i heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death
and he has been flapping those grim wings to some purpose of late lucy 's mother and arthur 's father and now
let me get on with my work
id uly relieved van helsing in his watch over lucy
we wanted arthur to go to rest also but here fused at first
it was only when it old him that we should want him to help us during the day and that we must not all breakdown for want of rest lest lucy should suffer that he agreed to go
van helsing was very kind to him
come my child he said
come with me
you are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much mental pain aswell as that taxon your strength that we know of
you must not be alone for tobe alone is to be full of fear sandal arms
come to the drawing room where the reis abi gfi re andthe rear et wos of a s
you shall lie on one and ion the other and our sympathy will be comfort to eachother eventhough wed on ots peak and even if we sleep
arthur went off with him casting back along in glo okon lucy 's face which lay in her pillow almost white rth an the law n
she lay quite still and ilo ok eda round the room to see that all was a sits hould be
ico uld see that the professor had carried out in this room asin the other his purpose of using the garlic
the whole of the windows ashes reeked with it and round lucy 's neck over the silk handkerchief which van helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers
lucy was breathing somewhat ster to rous lya nd her face was a tits worst for the open mouth showed the pale gums
her teeth in the dim uncertain lights eem ed longer and sharper than the yha dbe en inthe morning
in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest
is a tdo wn beside her and present lys he moved uneasily
atthe same moment there came as orto fdu ll flapping or buffeting at the window
i went over to its of tly and peeped out by the corner of the blind
the rewa saf ull moonlight and i could see that the noise was made by agreat bat which wheeled around doubtless attracted by the light although so dim and every now and against ruck the window with its wings
when i came back to my seat if ound that lucy had moved slightly and had to rna way the garlic flowers from her throat
ire place dthe mas well as i could and sat watching her
presently she woke and iga veh erf ood as van helsing had prescribed
she took but alittle and that languidly
the red id not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto soma rke dhe rill ness
it struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her
it was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with the ster to rous breathing she put the flowers from her butt hat when she wake dsh ecl utc he dthe mcl ose
the rewa sno possibility of making any mistake about this for inthe long hours that followed she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times
at six o'clock van helsing came to relieve me
arthur had the nfa llen into a doze and he mercifully let him sleep on
when he saw lucy 's face ico uld heart he hissing in draw of breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper
draw up the blind
iwan tli ght
the nhe be ntd own and with his face almost touching lucy 's examined her carefully
here moved the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat
as he did so he started back and i could hear his ejaculation mein got t
as it was smothered in his throat
iben to vera nd looked to oanda sino tice dso me queer chill came over me
the wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared
for full yf ive minutes van helsing stood looking at her with his face at its stern est
the nhe turned to mean dsa idc alml ys he is dying
it will not belong now
it will be much difference mark me whether she dies conscious or in her sleep
wake that poor boy and let him come and see the last
he trusts usa nd wehave promised him
i went to the dining room and wake dhi m
he was dazed for a moment but when he saw the sunlight streaming in through the edges of the shutter she thought he was late and expressed his fear
ias sure dhi mth at lucy was still asleep but to ldh imas gently as i could that both van helsing and if eared that the end was near
he covered his face with his hands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remained perhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shoulders shook with grief
it ook him by the hand and raised him up
come is a idm yd ear old fellow summon all your fortitude
it will be best and easiest for her
when we came into lucy 's room ico uld see that van helsing had with his usual for eth ought been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible
he had even brushed lucy 's hair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual sunny ripples
when we came into the rooms he opened her eyes and seeing him whispered softly arthur
oh my love iams ogl a dyo uha veco me
he was stooping to kiss her when van helsing motion ed him back
no he whispered not yet
hold her hand it will comfort her more
so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her best with all the softline sma tch in gthe angelic beauty of her eyes
the ngr a dual lyh ere yes closed and she sank to sleep
for alittle bit her breast heaved softly and her breath came and went like a tired child 's
and the nin sensibly the rec amet hestra nge change which i had noticed in the night
her breathing grew ster to rous the mouth opened and the pale gums drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever
in a sort of sleep waking vague unconscious ways he opened her eyes which were now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voices uch as i had never heard from her lips arthur
oh my love iams ogl a dyo uha veco me
kiss me
arthur ben tea ger lyo verto kiss her but at that instant van helsing who like me had been start led by her voice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck with both hands dragged him back with a fury of strength which in ever thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almost across the room
not on your life
he said not for your living soul and her s
and he stood between the mli kea lion at bay
arthur was so take naba ckt hath edi dno tfor am omen tkn oww hat to do orsay and before any impulse of violence could seize him here alized the place and the occasion and stood silent waiting
ike ptm yey esf i xed on lucy as did van helsing and we saw a spasm as of rage flit like a shadow over her face
the sharp teeth clamped to get her
the nhe reyes closed and she breathed heavily
very short lya fter she opened her eyes in all the irs of tness and putting out her poor pale thin hand to ok van helsing 's great brown on edra wing it close to her she kissed it
my true friends he said in a faint voice but with un tell a ble path osm yt rue friend and his
oh guard him and give me peace
is wear it
he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up his hand as one who register san oath
the nhe turned to arthur and said to him come my child take her hand in your sand kiss her on the forehead and only once
the ire yes metin stead of the irl ipsa nds othe ypa rted
lucy 's eyes closed and van helsing who had been watching closely to oka rth ur 's armand drew him away
and the nlu cy 's breathing became ster to rous again and all at once it ceased
it is all over said van helsing
she is dead
it ook arthur by the armand led him away to the drawing room where he sat down and covered his face with his hands sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see
i went back to the room and found van helsing looking at poor lucy and his face was sterner than ever
some change had come over her body
death had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks had recovered some of the irf lowing lines
event heli psh adlo stth eir deadly pallor
it was a sift he blood nolonger needed for the working ofthe heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be
we thought he rd ying whilst she slept and sleeping when she died
is to odb esi devan helsing and said a hwe llp oor girl there is peace for her atlas t
it is the end
he turned to mean dsa id with graves ole mn it ynot so alas
not so
it is only the beginning
when i asked him what he meant he only shook his head and answered we can do not hing as yet
wait and see

it 's quite a privilege to attend on her
it 's not to om uch to say that she will do credit to our establishment
in otice dth at van helsing never kept faraway
this was possible from the disorder eds tate of things in the household
the re were no relatives at hand and as arthur had to be back then ext day to attend a this father 's funeral we were unable to notify anyone who should have been bidden
under the circumstances van helsing and it ook it upon ourselves to examine papers etc
he insisted upon looking over lucy 's paper shims elf
ias ked him why for if eared that he being a foreign erm ight not be quite aware of english legal requirements and so might in ignorance makes ome unnecessary trouble
he answered me iknow iknow
you forget that i am a lawyer aswell as a doctor
but this is not altogether for the law
you knew that when you avoided the coroner
ihave more than him to avoid
the rema ybe papers more such as this

for me i watch her ein the room and in miss lucy 's old room all night and i myself search for what maybe
it is not well that he rver yth ought sgo into the hands of strangers
i went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found the name and address of mrs
westenra 's solicitor and had written to him
all the poor lady 's paper swer ein order
explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given
i had hardly sealed the letter when to my surprise van helsing walked into the rooms ayin gca nih el pyo ufr iend john

alas
before turning in we went to look at poor lucy
the undertaker had certainly do neh is work well for the room was turned into a small chapel lear dente
the rewa saw il der ness of beautiful white flowers and death was made as little repulsive as might be
the end of the winding sheet was laid over the face
when the professor be nto vera ndt urn edit gently back web oth started at the beauty before us
the tall wax candles showing as uffici ent light to note it well
all lucy 's loveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passed instead of leaving traces of 'd eca y 's effacing fingers ' had but restored the beauty of life till positive lyic ould not believe my eyes that i was looking at a corpse
the professor looked sternly grave
he had not love dhe ras iha dan dthe re was none edf or tears in his eyes
he said to me remain till i return an dle ftth eroom
he came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the hall but which had not been opened and placed the flowers amongst the other son and around the bed
the nhe to okf rom his neck inside his collar alittle gold crucifix and placed it over the mouth
here store dthe sheet to its place and we came away
iwas undressing in my own room when with a pre monitor yt apa tthe door he entered and at once began to speak
tomorrow i want you to bring me before night as et of postmortem knives

we shall unscrew the coffin lida nds hall do our operation and the nre place all so that none know save we alone
but why do it at all
the girl is dead
why mutilate her poor body without need
and if the reis none cess it yfor apos tmo rte man dno thing to gain by it no good to her to us to science to human knowledge why do it
without such it is monstrous
for answer he put his hand on my shoulder and said with infinite tenderness friend john ipit yy our poor bleeding heart and ilove you the more because it does so bleed
if i could iwould take on myself the burden that you do bear
but there are things that you know not but that you shall know and bless me for knowing thought he yare not pleasant things

ima yer ria mb utm an but i believe in all id o
was it not for the sec aus est hat you send form ewh ent hegre at trouble came
yes
were you not amazed nay horrified when i would not let arthur kiss his love though she was dying and snatched him away by all my strength
yes
and yet you saw how she thanked me with her so beautiful dying eyes her voice to oso weak and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me
yes
and did you not hear me swear promise to her that so she closed her eyes grateful
yes

he paused a moment and went on solemnly friend john there are strange and terrible day sbe for eu s
let us not be two but one that so we work to ago oden d
will you not have faith in me
it ook his hand and promised him
i held my door open as he went away and watched him goto his room and close the door
asist ood without moving is a won eof the maids pass silently along the passage she had her back to me so did not seem eand goin to the room where lucy lay
the sight to uche dme
devotion is so rare and wear eso grateful to those who show it unasked to those we love
here was a poor girl putting aside the terror sw hich she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress who ms he loved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid to eternal rest
imus tha ves lept long and sound lyf or it was broad daylight when van helsing wake dme by coming into my room
he came over to my bedside and said you need not trouble about the knives
we shall not do it
why not
ias ked
for his solemnity of the night before had great ly impressed me
because he said sternly it is to olate or to oea rly
see
here hehe ldu pthe little golden crucifix
this was stolen in the night
how stolen ias ked in wonder since you have it now
because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living
her punishment will surely come but not through me
she knew not altogether what she did and thus unknowing she only stole
now we must wait
he went away on the word leaving me with an ew mystery to think of an ew puzzle to grapple with
the forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came mr
marquand of whole manson smar quand lid der dale
he was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands all care sast ode tails
during lunch he told us that mrs
westenra had for sometime expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairs in absolute order
he informed us that with the exception of acer taine nta ile d property of lucy 's father which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal was left absolutely to arthur holmwood
when he had to ldu sso much he went on frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free ass he should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance
indeed we pressed the matter sofa rth at weal most came into collision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes
ofcourse we had the nno alternative but to accept
we were right in principle and ninety nine times out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgment
frankly however imus tad mitt hatin this case anyother for mof disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes
for by her pre dec easing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even had she only survived her mother by five minutes her property would incase the re were now ill and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case have been treated at her decease asunder intestacy
inwhich case lord god al ming though so dear afri end would have had no claim in the world
and the inheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon the ir just right sfor sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger
ias sure you my dear sir siam rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced
he was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little part in which he was officially interested of so great at raged yw as an object lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding
he did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day and see lord god al ming
his coming however had been acer tain comfort to us since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts
arthur was expected at five o'clock so alittle before that time we visited the death chamber
it was so in very truth for now both mother and daughter layin it
the undertaker true to his craft had made the best display he could of his good sand there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once
van helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to explain in gth at a slo rdg oda lmi ng was coming very soon it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancee quite alone
the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left the mthe night before so that when arthur came such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved
poor fellow
he looked desperately sadan dbr oken
even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much tried emotions
he had ikn ewb een very genuine lya nd devoted lya tta che dto his father and to lose him and at such a time was a bitter blow to him
with me he was warm as ever and to van helsing he was sweet lyco urt eou s
but i could not help seeing that the rewa sso me constraint with him
the professor notice ditto oand motion edme to bring him upstairs
id id soa nd left him at the door of the room as if elt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my armand led me in saying huskily you love dhe rto ool dfe llow
she told me all about it and the rewa sno friend had a closer place in her heart than you
id on ' tkn ow howto thankyou for all you have done for her
ican ' tth in ky et
here he suddenly broke down and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast crying oh jack
jack
what shall id o
the whole of life seems gone from meal laton cea ndt here is not hing in the wide world for me to live for
icom for ted him as well as i could
in such cases mendon otn eed much expression
agri po fthe hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder as obi nun is on a re expression so fs ymp at hyde art oam an 's heart
is to ods till and silent till his sobs died away and the nis aids of tly to him come and look at her
together we moved over to the bed and i lifted the law nfr omh erf ace
god
how beautiful she was
every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness
it frightened and amazed me somewhat
and as for arthur he fell to trembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an ague
atlas taft eral on gpa use hesa id to me in a faint whisper jack is she really dead
ias sure dhi msad lyth at it was so and went on to suggest for if elt that such a horrible doubts hould not have life for a moment longer than i could help that it often happened that after death faces becomes often edan dev en resolved into the ir youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering
is eem edt oq uite do away with any doubt and after kneeling beside the couch for awhile and looking at her loving lya nd long he turned aside
it old him that that must be good bye as the coffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead
he came away fondly looking back over his shoulder at her as he came
ile ft him in the drawing room and told van helsing that he had said goodbye so the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker 's men to proceed with the preparation sand to screw up the coffin
when he came out of the room again it old him of arthur 's question and here plied iam not surprised
just now i doubt edf or a moment myself
we all dined together and i could see that poor art was trying to make the best of things
van helsing had been silent all dinnertime but when we had lit our cigars he said lord
but arthur interrupted him
non on ott hat for god 's sake
not yet at any rate
forgive me sir
id id not mean to speak offensive ly
it is only because my loss is so recent
the professor answered very sweet ly ion ly used that name because i was in doubt
imus tno tca lly ou 'm r
' and ihave grown to love you yes my dear boy to love you as arthur
arthur held out his hand and took the old man 's warmly
call me what you will he said
ihop eim a ya lwa ys have the title of a friend
and let me say that i am at a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear
he paused a moment and went on iknow that she understood your goodness even better than i do
and if i was rude or in anyway wanting a tth at time you acted so you remember the professor nodded you must forgive me
he answered with a grave kindness iknow it was hard for you to quit etrust meth en fort otr us tsu ch violence needs to understand and it ake it that you do not that you can not trust me now for you do not yet understand
and the rema ybe more time sw he nisha llw an tyo uto trust when you can not and may not and must not yet understand

and indeed indeed sirsa ida rth urw arm ly

iknow and believe you have a very noble heart and you are jack 's friend and you were her s

the professor cleared his throat aco up leo ftime sast hough about to speak and finally said may ias kyou something now
certainly
you know that mrs
westenra left you all her property
no poor dear
in ever thought of it

arthur spoke out heartily like his old self dr
van helsing you may do what you will
if eel that in saying this iam doing what my dear one would have approved
is hall not trouble you with questions till the time comes
the old professor stood up as he said solemnly and you are right

if elt it very improper for you can ' tgo on for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls with out the pedantry of it biting into your self abit
but it was jonathan and he was my husband and we did n't know anybody who saw usa nd wed id n't care if the ydi dso on we walked
iwas looking at avery beautiful girl in a big cartwheel hats it ting in a victoria outside guiliano 's when i felt jonathan clutch my arms oti ght that he hurt me and he said under his breath my god
iam always anxious about jonathan for if earth at some nervous fit may upset him again
so it urn edt ohim quickly and asked him what it was that disturbed him
he was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half inter ror and half in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a beak yno sean dbl ack moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the pretty girl
he was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us and so i had a good view of him
his face was not ago odf ace
it was hard and cruel and sensual and big white teeth that looked all the white rbe cause his lips were sore dwe repo in ted like an animal 's
jonathan kept staring at him till i was afraid he would not ice
if eared he might take it ill he looked so fierce and nasty
ias ked jonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking that i knew as much about it as he did do you see who it is
node aris a id
id on ' tkn ow him who is it
his answers eem edt osho cka ndt hri llm efor it was said as if he did not know that it was mem in a to whom he was speaking
it is the man himself
the poor dear was evidently terrified at something very great lyte rrif ie d
id obe lieve that if he had not had met olean on and to support him he would have sunk down
he kept staring
aman came out of the shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then drove off
the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriage moved up piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed a hansom
jonathan kept looking after him and said as if to himself ibe lieve it is the count but he has grown young
my god if this be so
oh my god
my god
if only ikn ew
if only ikn ew
he was distressing himself so much that if eared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions soire maine dsi lent
id re wawa yq uie tly and he holding my arm came easily
we walked alittle further and the nwe nti nand sat for awhile in the green park
it was a hot day for autumn and the rewa saco mfor tables eatin as had yp lace
after a few minutes 's taringa tno thing jonathan 's eyes closed and he went quickly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder
it hough tit was the best thing for him so did not disturb him
in about twenty minutes he woke up and said to mequite cheerfully why min aha vei been asleep
oh do forgive me for being so rude
come and we 'll have a cup of tea somewhere
he had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger asin his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of
id on ' tli ket his lapsing into forgetfulness
it may make or continue some injury to the brain
imus tno task him for fear is hall do more harm than good but i must somehow learn the fact so fhi sjo urn ey abroad
the time is come if ear when i must open the parcel and know what is written
oh jonathan you will iknow for give me if i do wrong but it is for your own dear sake
later
as a dho me coming in every way the house empty of the dears oul who was so good to us
jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now at el eg ram from van helsing whoever he may be
you will be grieved to hear that mrs
westenra died five days ago and that lucy died the day before yesterday
the yw ere both buried today
oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words
poor mrs
westenra
poor lucy
gone gone never to return to us
and poor poor arthur to have lost such as we et ness out of his life
god help us all to be a rou rtr ou bles
dr
seward 's diary cont
september
it is all over
arthur has gone back to ring and has taken quincey morris with him
what afin efe llow is quincey
i believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered a smu cha bout lucy 's death as an yof usb uthe bore him self through it like a moral viking
if america can go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the world indeed
van helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to his journey
he goes to amsterdam tonight but says he returns tomorrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally
heist osto pwi thm ethe nif he can
he says he has work to do in london which may take him sometime
poor old fellow
if earth at the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength
all the time of the burial he was ico uld see putting some terrible restraint on himself
when it was all over we were standing beside arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucy 's veins
ico uld see van helsing 's face grow white and purple by turn s
arthur was saying that he felt since the nas ifthe yt woh adbe en really married and that she was his wife in the sight of god
none of us said a word of the other operations and none of use vers hall
arthur and quincey went away together to the station and van helsing and icam eon here
the moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to are gular fit of hysterics
he has denied to me since that it was hysterics and insisted that it was only his sense of humor asserting itself under very terrible conditions
he laughed till he cried and i had to drawdown the blind sles tan yon esh ould see usa nd misjudge
and the nhe cried till he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a woman does
it ried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under the circumstances but it had no effect
men and women are so different in manifestations of nervous strength or weakness
the nw he nhis face grew grave and stern again ias ked him why his mirth and why at such a time
his reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and forceful and mysterious
he said a hyo udon ' tcom pre he ndf rien dj oh n
don ott hink that i am not sad though i laugh
see ihave cried even when the laugh did choke me
but no more think that i am all sorry when i cry for the laugh he come just the same
keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say 'm ayi come in
' is not true laughter
no
he is a king and he come when and how he like
he ask nope rso nh echo ose not ime of suitability
he say ' iam here
' behold in example igr ie vem yhe art out for that so sweet young girl
igiv em yb loo dfor her though i am old and worn
igiv em yt ime my skill my sleep
ile tm yot her sufferers want that she may have all
and yet ican laugh at her very grave laugh when the clay from the spade of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say ' thu dth ud
' to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek
my heart bleed for that poor boy that dear boy so ofthe age of mine own boy had ibe enso blessed that he live and with his hair and eyes the same
the rey ouk now now why i love him so
and yet when he say things that touch my husband heart to the quick and make my father heart year nto him as to no other man note ven you friend john for wear em or elev eline xperience sth an father and sony et even at such a moment king laugh he come to mean dsh out and bellow in my ear ' here iam
here iam
' till the blood come dance back and brings omeo fthe sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek
oh friend john it is a strange world as a dwo rld a world full of miseries and woes and trouble s
and yet when king laugh come hema ket he mall dance to the tune he play
bleeding heart sand dry bones of the church yard and tears that burn as the yf all all dance together to the music that he make with that smile less mouth of him
and believe me friend john that he is good to come and kind
ah wemen and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways
the nte ars come and like the rain on the ropes the yb race us up until perhaps the strain become too great and web re ak
but king laugh he come like the sunshine and he ease of fthe strain again and web ear to go on with our labor what it may be
id id not like to wound him by pretending not to see his idea but as i did not yet understand the cause of his laughter ias ked him
as he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone oh it was the grim iron yof it all this solove lyla dy garland ed with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that so fine marble house in that lonely churchyard where rest soma ny of her kin laid the re with the mother who loved her and who ms he loved and that sacred bell going ' to ll
toll
toll
's osada ndsl owa ndt hose holy men with the white garments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the time the ire yes never onthe page and all of us with the bowed head
and all for what
she is dead so
is it not
well for the life of me professor is a idi can ' tse ean yth in gto laugh at in all that
why you rex press ion makes it aha rder puzzle than before
but even if the burial service was comic what about poor art and his trouble
why his heart was simply breaking
just so
said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride
yes and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him
quite so
but there was a difficult yf rien dj oh n
if so that the nw hat about the other s
hoho
the nthis so sweet maid is a poly and rist and me with my poor wife dead to me but alive by church 's law though now it sall gone even i who am faithful husband to this now now if eam big amis t
id on ' tse ewh ere the joke comes in the re either
is a ida ndi did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things
he laid his hand on my armand said friend john forgive me if i pain
ishow edn otm yf eel in gto other sw he nit would wound but only to you my old friend who mica ntr us t
if you could have looked into my heart the nw he niwa ntt ola ugh ifyou could have done so when the laugh arrived ifyou could do so now when king laugh have pack up his crown and all that is to him for he go far faraway from mean dfor along longtime maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all
iwas touched by the tenderness of histone and asked why
because i know
and now we are all scattered and for many along day loneliness will sit over our roof swith brooding wings
lucy lies in the tomb of her kina lord lyde at hho use in alone lyc hur ch yard away from teeming london where the air is fresh and the sunrise sover hampstead hill and where wildflowers grow oftheir own accord
so i can finish this diary and god only knows if i shall ever be gina not her
if i do or if i even open this again it will be to deal with different people and different themes for her eat the end where the romance of my life is to lde re igo back to take up the thread of my life work is a ysa dly and without hope finis

van helsing telegram mrs
harker to van helsing september
come to day by quarter past ten train ifyou can catch it
can see you anytime you call
wilhelmina harker min aha rke r 's journal september
icann othe lpf eel in gte rri blye xcite das the time draws near fort he visit of dr
van helsing for some how i expect that it will throw some light upon jonathan 's sad experience and as he attended poor dear lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her
that is the reason of his coming
it is concerning lucy and her sleepwalking and not about jonathan
the nisha lln ever know the real truth now
how silly iam
that awful journal get shold of my imagination and tinges everything with something of its own colour
ofcourse it is about lucy
that habit came back to the poor dear and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill
i had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards
she must have to ldh imo fhe rsl eep walking adventure on the cliff and that i knew all about it and now he wants me to tell him what i know so that he may understand
ihop eid id right in not saying anything of it to mrs
westenra
is hould never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even an egat ive one brought harmon poor dear lucy
ihop et ood r
van helsing will not blame me
ihave had so much trouble and anxiety of late that if eel icann otb ear more just a tpr ese nt
is up pose a cry does usa llg ood at times clear sthe air as other rain does
perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me and the njo nathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and night the first time we have been part eds in ceo urm arri age
id ohope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will occur to upset him
it is two o'clock and the doctor will be here soon now
is hall say nothing of jonathan 's journal unless he asks me
iams ogl adi have typewritten out my own journal soth at incase he asks about lucy ican hand it to him
it will save much question in g
later
he has come and gone
oh what astra nge meeting and how it all makes my head whirl round
if eel like one in a dream
can it be all possible or even apart of it
if i had not read jonathan 's journal first is hould never have accepted even a possibility
poor poor dear jonathan
how he must have suffered
please the good god all this may not upset him again
is hall try to save him from it
but it may be even a consolation and ahelp to him terrible though it be an daw ful in its consequences to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him and that it is all true
it may be that it is the doubt which haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matter which waking or dreaming may prove the truth he will be more satisfied and better able to be a rthe shock
dr
van helsing must be a good man aswell as a clever one if he is arthur 's friend and dr
seward 's and if the yb rough thi mall the way from holland to look after lucy
if eel from having seen him that he is good and kinda nd of an ob lena ture
when he comes to morrow is hall ask him about jonathan
and the npl ease god all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to ago oden d
i used to think i would like to practice interviewing
jonathan 's friend onthe exeter news told him that memory is everything in such work that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken even if you had to refine some of it afterwards
here was a rare interview
is hall try to record it verbatim
it was half past two o'clock when the knock came
it ook my courage ade uxm ains and waited
in a few minutes mary opened the door and announced dr
van helsing
iros eand bowed and he came to ward sme amano fme dium weight strongly built with his shoulders setback over abroad deep chest and an eck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck
the poise of the head strikes me at once a sin dica tive of thought and power
the head is no blew ells ized broad and large behind the ears
the face clean shaven shows a hard square china larger esol ute mobile mouth ago ods ized nose rather straight but with quick sensitive nostrils that seem to broaden as the big bush yb rows comedown and the mouth tightens
the forehead is broad and fine rising at first almost straight and the nsl oping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart such a forehead that the reddish hair can not possibly tumble over it but falls naturally back and to the sides
big darkblue eyes are set widely apart and are quick and tender or stern with the man 's moods
he said to me mrs
harker is it not
i bowed assent
that was miss min am urr a y
again ias sent ed
it is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dear child lucy westenra
madam min ait is on account of the dead that icom e
siris aid you could have no better claim on meth an that you were a friend and help ero flu cy westenra
and i held out my hand
he took it and said tenderly ohm adam min aik now that the friend of that poor little girl must be good but i had yet to learn
he finished his speech with a court ly bow
ias ked him what it was that he wanted to see me about so he at once began
ihave ready our letters to miss lucy
forgive me but i had to begin to inquire somewhere and the rewa sno net oas k
iknow that you were with her at whitby
she sometimes kept a diary you need not look surprised madam min a
it was begun after you had left and was an imitation of you and in that diary she traces by inference certain things to asleep walking in which she puts down that you save dhe r
in great perplexity the nico met oyo uand ask you out of your som uch kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember
icant elly oui think dr
van helsing all about it
ah the ny ou have good memory for facts for details
it is not always so with young ladies
no doctor but i wrote it all down at the time
ican show it to you ifyou like
oh madam min aiw ell be grateful
you will do me much favour
ico uld not resist the temptation of mystifying him abit is up pose it is some taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths so i handed him the shorthand diary
he took it with a grateful bow and said may ire adit
if you wish i answered as demurely as i could
he opened it and for an instant his face fell
the nhes to odu pan dbo wed
oh you so clever woman
he said
i knew long that mr
jonathan was a man of much thankfulness but see his wife have all the good thing s
and will you not so much honour mean dso help me as to read it for me
alas
iknow not the shorthand
by this time my little joke was over and iwasa lmos tasha med
so it ook the typewritten copy from my work basket and handed it to him

ico uld not help it but i had been thinking that it was of dear lucy that you wish edt oas kand so that you might not have time to wait not on myaccount but because i know your time must be precious ihave written it out on the typewriter for you

you are so good he said
and may ire adit now
ima yw an tto ask you something sw he nih avere a d
by all means is a idr ead it over whilst i order lunch and the ny ouc an ask me questions whilst we eat
he bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light and became so absorbed in the paper sw hi lst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed
when i came back if ound him walking hurriedly up and down the room his face all ablaze with excitement
her us he dup to mean dto ok me by both hands
oh madam min ah esa id how can i say what i owe to you

ihave ready our last two letters
i went on isup pose this upset him for when we were in town on thursday last he had a sort of shock
as hock and after brain fever so soon
that is not good
what kind of shock was it
he thought he saw someone who recalled something terrible something which led to his brain fever
and here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush
the pity for jonathan the horror which he experienced the whole fearful mystery of his diary and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since all came in a tumult
is up pose iwas hysterical for it hr ewm ys elf on my knees and held up my hands to him and implored him to make my husband well again
he took my hands and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me
hehe ldm yha ndi nhis and said to me with ohsu chin finite sweetness mylife is a barren and lonely one and so full of work that ihave not had much time for friendship sbu tsin cei have been summoned to hereby my friend john seward ihave known soma ny good people and see nsu chn obi lity that if eel more than ever and it has grown with my advancing years the loneliness of my life

truly the reis no such thing as final it y
not a week since i said finis and yet here iams tart in gfr esha gain or rather going on with the record
until this afternoon i had no cause to think of what is done
renfield had become to all intents as sane as he ever was
he was already well ahead with his fly business and he had just started in the spider line also so he had not been of any trouble to me
i had a letter from arthur written on sunday and from it iga the rth at heis bearing up wonderful ly well
quincey morris is with him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of goods piri ts
quincey wrote meal in eto oand from him ihe art hat arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to the mall my mind is a tres t
as for myself iwas settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for its otha tim ight fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on me was becoming cica tris ed
everything is however now reopened and what is to be the end god only knows
ihave an idea that van helsing think she knows too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity
he went to exeter yesterday and stay edt here all night
today he came back and almost bounded in to the room at about half past five o'clock and thrust lastnight 's westminster gazette into my hand
what do you think of that
he asked ashes to odb ack and folded his arms

it did not convey much to me until i reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on the irth roa ts
an idea struck me and ilo ok edu p

simply that the reiss ome cause in common

id id not quite understand his answer
that is true indirectly but not directly
how do you mean professor
ias ked
iwasa little inclined to take his seriousness lightly for afterall four days of rest and freedom from burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore one 's spirit sbu twh enis a whi sfac eit sobered me
never even in the midst of our despair about poor lucy had he looked more stern
tell me
is a id
ican hazard no opinion
id on otk now what to think and ihave no data on which to found a conjecture
do you mean to tell me friend john that you have no suspicion as to what poor lucy died of not after all the hints given not only by events but by me
of nervous prostration following agreat loss or waste of blood
and how was the blood lost or waste d

ahi tis the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not the nits a yst here is not hing to explain
but yet we see around us everyday the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be young like the fine ladies at the opera

here ii nter rupt ed him
iwas getting bewildered
he so crowded on my mind his list of nature 's eccentricities and possible impossibilities that my imagination was getting fired
i had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at amsterdam
but he used the mto tell me the things otha tico uld have the object of thought i nmi nda llt he time
but now i was without his help yet iwan ted to follow him so i said professor let me be your pets tudent again
tell me the thesis so that i may apply your knowledge as you go on
at present iam going in my mind from point to point as a madman and not as an eon efo llow san idea
if eel like an ovi cel umber in gth rough a bog in amidst jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where i am going
that is a good image hesa id
well is hall tell you
myth esis is this iwan tyo uto believe
to believe what
to believe in things that you can not
let me illustrate
i heard on ceo fan american who so defined faith ' that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue
' for one if oll owt hat man
he meant that we shall have an open mind and not let alittle bit of truth check the rush of the big truth like a small rock does arai lwa yt ruck
we get the small truth first
good
we keep him and we value him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the truth in the universe
the ny ou want me not to let some previous conviction in ure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter
do i read your lesson aright
ah you are my favourite pupils till
it is worth to teach you
now that you are willing to understand you have taken the first step to understand
you think the nth at those so small holes in the children 's throats were made by the same that made the holes in miss lucy

he stood up and said solemnly the ny oua re wrong
oh would it were so
but alas
no
it is worse far far worse
in god 's name professor van helsing what do you mean

he threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed his elbows on the table covering his face with his hands ashes poke

it was a sif he had during her life struck lucy on the face

van helsing are you mad
her aise dhis head and looked at mean dso me how the tenderness of his face calmed me at once
would i were
he said

oh my friend why think you did i go sofa rro und why take solo ngt otel lso simple at hing
was it because i hate you and have hated you all my life
was it because i wish edt ogi vey oup ain
was it that i wanted now so later even gef or that time when you save dmy life and from a fearful death
ahn o
forgive me said i
he went on my friend itwas because i wish edt obe gentle in the breaking toy ouf or iknow you have loved that so sweet lady
but even yet i do not expect you to believe
it is so hard to accept a ton cea ny abstract truth that we may doubts uch to be possible when we have always believed the ' no ' of it
it is more hard still to accept sosa dacon crete truth and of such a one as miss lucy
tonight i got opr ove it
dare you come with me
this staggered me
amando esn otl ike to prove such a truth byron except edf rom the category jealousy
and prove the very truth hemos tab horr ed
he saw my hesitation and spoke the logic is simple nomad man 's logic this time jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog
if it not be true then proof will be relief
at worst it will not harm
if it be true
ah there is the dread
yet every dreads hould help my cause for in it is some need of belief
come it elly ou what i propose
first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital
dr
vincent ofthe north hospital where the paper ssa ythe child is isaf rien do fmi nea ndi think of your ssi nce you were in class at amsterdam
he will let two scientists see his case if he will not let two friends
we shall tell him nothing but only that we wish to learn
and the n

he took a key from his pocket and held it up
and the nwe spend the night you and i inthe churchyard where lucy lies
this is the key that lock the tomb
i had it from the coffin man to give to arthur
my heart sank with in me for if elt that the rewa sso me fearful or deal before us
ico uld donot hing however so i plucked up what heart ico uld and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon was passing
we found the child awake
it had had asleep and take nso me food and altogether was going on well
dr
vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the puncture s
the rewa snom is taking the similarity to those which had been on lucy 's throat
the yw eres maller and the edges looked fresh erth at was all
we asked vincent to what he attributed the man dhe replied that it must have been a bit eof some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to think it was one of the bats which are so numerous onthe northern heights of london

the sef an cies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night it would probably be fatal
but in any case is up posey ou will not let it away for some days
certainly not not for a week atleast longer if the wound is not healed
our visit to the hospital to ok more time than we had reckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out
when van helsing saw how dark itwas he said the reis not hurry
it is more late than it hough t
come let us seeks ome where that we may eat and the nwe shall go on our way
we dined at ' jack straw 's castle ' alongwith alittle crowd of bicyclists and other sw how ereg en ial lyn ois y
about ten o'clock west art edf rom the inn
it was the nve ry dark and the scattered lamps made the darkness greater when we were once outside the irin dividual radius
the professor had evidently not edt her oad we were to go for he went on unhesitatingly but as for me iwas in quite a mix up as to local it y
as we went further we met fewer and fewer people till atlas twe were somewhat surprised when we met event hepa trol of horse police going their usual suburban round
atlas twere ached the wall of the church yard which we climbed over
with some little difficulty for it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to us we found the west en rat omb
the professor took the key opened the creaky door and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motion edme to precede him
the rewa sade licious iron yin the offer in the court lines so fgi ving preference on such a ghastly occasion
my companion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to aftercare fully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not as pring one
in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight
the nhe fumbled in his bag and taking out am at chb oxa nda piece of candle proceeded to make a light
the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now someday saft erw ards when the flowers hung lanka nd dead their white stu rning to rust and the irg re enst obr own sw he nthe spider and the beetle had resumed their accustomed dominance when the time discoloured stone and dust encrusted mortar and rusty dan kiron and tarnished brass and clouded silver plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a candle the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined
it conveyed irresistibly the idea that life animal life was not the only thing which could pass away
van helsing went about his work systematically
holding his candles otha the could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as the yto uche dthe metal he made assurance of lucy 's coffin
another search in his bag and he took out at urns crew
what are you going to do
ias ked
to open the coffin
you shall yet be convinced
straight way he began taking out the screws and finally lifted off the lids how in gthe casing of lead beneath
the sight was almost too much for me
it seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped of fhe rcl othing in her sleep whilst living
iac tually to ok hold of his hand to stop him
he only said you shall see and again fumbling in his bag to oko uta tiny frets a w
striking the turn screw through the lead with a swift downwards tab which made me wince he made as mall hole which was however big enough to admit the point of the saw
i had expected ar us hof gas from the week old corpse
we doctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed to such things and i drew back to ward sthe door
but the professor never stopped for a moment
he saw edd own a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin and the nac ross and down the other side
taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back to ward sthe foot of the coffin and holding up the candle in to the aperture motion edt ome to look
id re wn ear and looked
the coffin was empty
it was certainly as urp rise to mean dga vem eac on siderable shock but van helsing was unmoved
he was now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task
are you satisfied now friend john
he asked
if elta llt he dogged argumentative ness of my nature awake with in meas ian swer ed him iams at is fied that lucy 's body is not in that coffin but that only proves one thing
and what is that friend john
that it is not there
that is good logic he said sofa ras it goes
but how do you how can you account for it not being the re
perhaps a body snatcher is ugg este d
some of the undertaker 's people may have stolen it
if elt that i was speaking folly and yet it was the only real cause which i could suggest
the professor sighed
ah well
he said we must have more proof
come with me
he put on the coffin lida gain gathered up all his things and placed the mint he bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in the bag
we opened the door and went out
behind us he closed the door and locked it
he handed me the keys ayin gwi lly ouk eep it
you had better be assured
i laughed it was not avery cheerful laugh iam bound to say as imoti one dhi mto keep it
ake yi snot hingis aid the rear eman yd up lic at esa nda ny how it is not difficult to pick a lock of this kind
he said nothing but put the key in his pocket
the nhe to ldm et owa tch at one side of the church yard whilst he would watch at the other
it ook up myplace behind a yew tree and is a whi sda rkf igure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight
it was alone ly vigil
just after i had taken myplace ihe arda distant clocks trike twelve and in time came on eand two
iwas chilled and unnerved and angry with the professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming
iwas to oco lda ndt oos lee pyt obe keenly observant and not sleep yen ought obe tray my trust so altogether iha dad rear ym is erable time
suddenly as it urn ed round it hough tisa wso meth in gli kea white streak moving between two dark yew tree sat the side of the church yard farthest from the tomb
atthe sametime adar km as smo ved from the professor 's side of the ground and hurriedly went to ward sit
the nito omo ved but i had to go round headstones and rail edo fft omb sand is tumbled over graves
the sky was overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew
alittle ways of fbe yond aline of scattered juniper trees which marked the pathway to the church awh it edi mfi gure flitted in the direction of the tomb
the tomb itself was hidden by trees and i could not see where the figure had disappeared
i heard the rustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure and coming over found the professor holding in his arms at in ych il d
when he saw me he held it out to mean dsa ida re you satisfied now
no isa idina way that if elt was aggressive
do you not see the child
yes it is a child but who brought it here
and is it wounded
we shall see said the professor and with one impulse we took our way out of the church yard he carrying the sleeping child
when we had got some little distance away we went into a clump of trees and struck a match and looked at the child 's throat
it was without a scratch or scar of any kind
was irig ht
ias ked triumphantly
we were just in time said the professor thankfully
we had no wto decide what we were to do with the child and so consulted about it
if we were to take it to apo lice station we should have to give some account of our movement sdu ring the night
atleast we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child
sofina lly wed eci de dth at we would take it to the heat hand when we heard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to find it
we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could
all fell out well
atthe edge of hampstead heath we heard a policeman 's heavy tramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro
we heard his exclamation of astonishment and the nwe went away silently
by good chance we got a cab near the ' spain iar ds ' and drove to town
icann ots lee pso imake this entry
but i must try to get a few hours 's lee pas van helsing is to call for meat noon
he insists that i go with him on another expedition
september
it was two o'clock before we found as uit able opportunity for our attempt
the funeral held at noon was all completed and the last stragglers of the mourners had taken themselves lazily away when looking carefully from behind a clump of alder trees we saw the sexton lock the gate after him
we knew that we were safe till morning did we desire it but the professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most
again if elt that horrid sense of the reality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and ire alized distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unh allowed work
besides if elt it was all sous eles s
outrageous as it was too penal eade nco ffi nto see if a woman dead nearly a week were really dead it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our own eyes ight that the coffin was empty
is hru gge dmy should ers however andres ted silent for van helsing hadaway of going on his own road noma tter whore mon strated
he took the key opened the vault and again courteously motion edme to precede
the place was not so gruesome as lastnight but oh how unu tter ably mean looking when the sunshine stream edin
van helsing walked over to lucy 's coffin and if oll owed
he bent over and again for ced back the lead en flange and as hock of surprise and dismay shot through me
the relay lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral
she was if possible more radiant ly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that she was dead
the lips were red nay redder than before and onthe cheeks was a delicate bloom
is this aj ugg le
is a idt ohim
are you convinced now
said the professor in response and ashes poke he put over his hand and in a way that made me shudder pulled back the dead lips and showed the white teeth
see he went on the yare even sharper than before
with this and this and he touched on eof the canine teeth and that below it the little children can be bitten
are you of belief now friend john
once more argumentative hostility woke with in me
ico uld not accept such an overwhelming idea ashes ugg este d
so with an attempt to argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed is a ids he may have been placed here since last night
indeed
that is so and by whom
id on otk now
someone has done it
and yet she has been dead on eweek
most people sin that time would not look so
i had no answer for this sowas silent
van helsing did not seem to notice my silence
at any rate hes how edn either chagrin nor triumph
he was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth
the nhe turned to mean dsa id here there is one thing which is different from all recorded
here is some dual life that is not as the common
she was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance sleepwalking oh you start
you do not know that friend john but you shall know it later and intra nce could he best come to take more blood
intra nces he dies and intra nces he is undead to o
so it is that she differ from all other
usually when the undead sleep at home ashes poke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was ' home ' the irfa ces how what they are but this so sweet that was when she not undead she goback to the nothing soft he common dead
the reis no malign the res eea nds oit make hard that i must kill her in her sleep
this turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon me that iwasa ccep ting van helsing 's theories
but if she were really dead what was the re ofte rro rint heide a of killing her
he looked up at mean dev ident lys a wthe change in my face for he said almost joyously a hyo ube lieven ow
ian swer edd on otp res smet ooh ardal laton ce
iam willing to accept
how will you do this bloody work
is hall cutoff her head and fill her mouth with garlic and is hall drive as taketh rough her body
it made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman who miha dlo ved
and yet the feeling was not so strong as i had expected
iwas in fact beginning to shudder at the presence of this being this undead as van helsing called it and to loathe it
is it possible that love is all subjective or all objective
iwai ted acon siderable time for van helsing to begin but he stood as if wrapped in thought
presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap and said ihave been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best
if i did simply follow my inclining iwould do now at this moment what is to be done
but there are other things to follow and things that are thousand times more difficult in that the mwe donot know
this is simple
she have yet no life taken thought hat is of time and to act now would be to take danger from her forever
but the nwe may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him of this
if you who saw the wounds on lucy 's throat and saw the wounds so similar onthe child 's atthe hospital ifyou who saw the coffin empty lastnight and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she die if you know of this and know of the white figure lastnight that brought the child to the church yard and yet of your own sense syo udi dno tbe lieve how the nca nie xp ect arthur who know none of those things to believe
he doubted me when it ook him from her kiss when she was dying
iknow he has forgiven me because i nso me mistaken idea ihave done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all wehave killed her
he will then argue back that it is we mistaken one sth at have killed her by our ideas and so he will be much unhappy always
yet he never can be sure and that is the worst of all
and he will sometimes think that she helo ved was buried alive and that will paint his dreams with horror so fw hats he must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that his sobel ove dwa saft eral lan undead
no
it old him once and since the nile a rnm uch
now since i know it is all true ahu ndr edt hous and times more doi know that he must passthrough the bitter water store acht he sweet
he poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him the nwe can act for good allround and send him peace
my mind is made up
let us go
your et urn home for tonight to your asylum and see that all be well
as for me is hall spend the night here in this church yard in my own way
tomorrow night you will come to me to the berkeley hotel at ten of the clock
is hall send for arthur to come to oanda lso that so fine young man of america that gave his blood
later we shall all have work to do
icom ewi thy ous of a rasp iccad illya ndt here dine for imus tbe back here before the sunset
so we locked the tomb and came away and got over the wall of the church yard which was not much of a task and drove back to piccadilly
note left by van helsing in his portmanteau berkeley hotel direct edt ojo hns ewa rdm
d
not delivered september friend john iwr it eth is in case anything should happen
i goal one to watch in that churchyard
it pleases me that the undead miss lucy shall not leave tonight that soon the morrow night she may be more eager
therefore is hall fix something ssh eli keno tga rli can dac ruc if i xand so seal up the door of the tomb
she is young as undead and will heed
moreover the sea re only to prevent her coming out
the yma yn otp rev a ilo nh erwan ting to get info rthe nthe undead is desperate and must find the line of least resistance whatsoever it may be
is hall beat hand all the night from sunset till after sunrise and if the rebe aug htt hat maybe learned is hall learn it
for miss lucy or from her ihave no fear but that other to whom is the retha tsh eis undead he have not the power to see kher to mba ndf in dsh elte r
he is cunning as iknow from mr
jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for miss lucy 's life and we lost and in many ways the undead are strong
he have always the strength in his hand of twenty men even we four who gave our strength to miss lucy it also is all to him
besides he can summon his wolf and iknow not what
so if it be that he came thither on this night he shall find me
but none other shall until it be too late
but it may be that he will not attempt the place
the reis nor eason why he should
his hunting ground is more full of game than the church yard where the undead woman sleeps and the one oldman watch
therefore i write this incase
take the paper sth at a re with this the diaries of harker and the rest and read the man dthe nfi ndt his great undead and cutoff his head and burn his heart or drive as taketh rough its otha tthe world may rest from him

seward 's diary september
it is wonderful what ago odn ight 's sleep will do for one
yesterday iwasa lmos twill in gto accept van helsing 's monstrous ideas but now they seem to start out lurid before me as outrage son commonsense
ihave no doubt that he believes it all
iwon der if his mind can have become in anyway unhinged
surely there must be some rational explanation of all the sem yst eri oust hing s
is it possible that the professor can have done it himself
he is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way
iam loathe to think it and indeed it would be almost as great amar velas the other to find that van helsing was mad but anyhow is hall watch him carefully

last night at alittle before ten o'clock arthur and quincey came into van helsing 's room
he told us all what he wanted us to do but especially addressing himself to arthur as if all our wills were centre dinh is
he began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him to ofor he said the reis agrave duty to be done the re
you were doubtless surprised at my letter
this query was directly addressed to lord god al ming
iwas
it rather upset me for a bit

met oos aid quincey morris laconic all y
oh said the professor then you are nearer the beginning both of youth an friend john here who has to go along wayback before he can even get sofa rast obe gin
it was evident that he recognized my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word
the ntu rning to the other two hesa id within ten seg ravi ty iwan tyo urp ermis sion to do what it hink good this night
it is iknow much to ask and when you know what it is ipro pose to do you will know and only the nho wmu ch

i'll answer for the professor

ihave done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dear to me

if you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of the set woth en igiv em yc on sent at once though for the life of me icann otu nder stand what you are driving at
iacc ept your limitations aid van helsing and all ias kof you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservation s
agreed
said arthur
that is only fair
and now that the pour parler sare over may ias kwh at it is weare to do
iwan tyo uto come with mean dto come in secret to the church yard at kings tea d
arthur 's face fell ashes aid in an amazed sort of way where poor lucy is buried
the professor bowed
arthur went on and when the re
to enter the tomb
arthur stood up
professor are you in earnest or is it some monstrous joke
pardon me is eet hat you are in earnest
he sat down again but i could see that he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity
the rewa ssi lence until he asked again and when i nthe to mb
to open the coffin
this is to om uch
he said angrily rising again
iam willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable but in this this desecration of the grave of one who
he fairly choked with indignation
the professor looked pitying lya thi m
if i could spare you one pang my poor friend he said god knows iwould
but this night our feet must tread in thorny paths or later and forever the feet you love must walk in paths of flame
arthur looked up with set whiteface and said take care sir take care
would it not be well to hear what i have to say
said van helsing
and the ny ou will atleast know the limit of my purpose
shall igo on
that 's fair enough broke in morris
after a pause van helsing went on evidently with an effort miss lucy is dead is it not so
yes
the nth erec an ben owr on gto her
but if she be not dead
arthur jumped to his feet good god
he cried
what do you mean

he groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften
id id not say she was alive my child
id id not think it

what did that poor sweet girl doth a tyo us hould want to cast such dishonour on her grave

don't dare think more of such a desecration
is hall not give my consent to anything you do
ihave adut yto doin protecting her grave from outrage and by god is hall do it
van helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated and said gravely and sternly my lord god al ming it ooh ave adut yto do adut yto other sad ut yto you adut yto the dead and by god is hall do it
all ias kyou now is that you come with me that you look and listen and if when later imake the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfillment event hania mthe nisha lld omy duty whatever it may seem to me
and the nto follow your lordship 's wishes is hall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will
his voice broke alittle and he went on with a voice full of pity
but i beseech you do not goforth in anger with me
in along life of acts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wring my heart ihave never had so heavy at a ska snow
believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look from you will wipe away all this sosa dho ur for iwould do what am an cantos ave you from sorrow

i gave her my nights and days before death after death and if my death can do her good even now when she is the dead undead she shall have it free ly
he said this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur was much affected by it
he took the old man 's hand and said in a broken voice oh it is hard to think of it and icann otu nder stand but atleast i shall go with you and wait
chapter dr
seward 's diary cont
it was just a quarter before twelve o'clock when we got into the church yard over the low wall
the night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the dents of the heavy clouds that scud de da cross the sky
we all kept some how close together with van helsing slightly infront as he led the way
when we had come close to the tomb ilo ok ed well at arthur for if eared the proximity to aplac elad en with so sorrowful am emory would upset him but he bore him self well
it ook it that the very mystery of the proceeding was in some way acount era ctan tto his grief
the professor unlocked the door and seeing an atural hesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty by entering first himself
the rest of us followed and he closed the door
he then lita dark lantern and pointed to a coffin
arthur stepped forward hesitatingly
van helsing said to me you were with me here yesterday
was the body of miss lucy in that coffin
it was
the professor turned to the rest saying you hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me
he took his screwdriver and again to oko fft heli do fthe coffin
arthur looked on very pale but silent
when the lid was removed he stepped forward
he evidently did not know that the rewa sale aden coffin or at any rate had not thought of it
when he saw the rent in the lead the blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell away again so that he remained of aghast ly whiteness
he was still silent
van helsing for ced back the lead en flange and we all looked in and recoiled
the coffin was empty
for several minutes noone spoke a word
the silence was broken by quincey morris professor ian swer edf or you
your word is all iwan t
iwould n't asks uch at hing ordinarily iwould n't so dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour or dishonour
is this your doing
is wear to you by all that i hold sacred that ihave not removed or touched her
what happened was this
two nights ago my friends ewa rda ndi came here with good purpose believe me
iop ened that coffin which was the nse aled up and we found it as now empty
we then waited and saw something white come through the trees
the next day we came here in daytime and she lay there
did she not friend john
yes
that night we were just in time
one more so small child was missing and we find it than kgo dun harmed amongst the graves
yesterday i came here before sundown for a tsun down the undead can move
iwai ted here all night till the sun rose but is a wno thing
it was most probable that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic which the undead can not be a rand other things which the ys hun
last night there was no exodus soton ight before the sundown it ook away my garlic and other things
and so it is we find this coffin empty
but bear with me
sofa rthe reis much that is strange
wait you with me outside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to be
so here he shut the dark slide of his lantern now to the outside
he opened the door and we filed out he coming last and locking the door behind him
oh
but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault
how sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scud ding clouds crossing and passing like the gladness and sorrow of a man 's life
how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air that had not a into fde at hand decay
how humanizing to see the redlight in gof the sky beyond the hill and to hear faraway the muffled roar that marks the life of agreat city
each in his own way was solemn and overcome
arthur was silent and was ico uld see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery
iwas myself to lera bly patient and half inclined again to throw aside doubt and to accept van helsing 's conclusions
quincey morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things and accepts the mint he spirit of cool bravery with hazard of all he has a tst a ke
not being able to smoke he cut himself ago ods ized plug of tobacco and began to chew
as to van helsing he was employed in a definite way
first he took from his bag amass of what looked like thin wafer like biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin
next het ook out a double handful of some whitish stuff like dough or put ty
he crumbled the wafer up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands
this het he nto okan droll in git into thin strips began to lay the mint othe crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb
iwas somewhat puzzle dat this and being close asked him what it was that he was doing
arthur and quincey drew near also as the yto ower ecu rious
he answered iam closing the tombs otha tthe undead may not enter
and is that stuff you have the rego in gto do it
it is
what is that which you are using
this time the question was by arthur
van helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered
the host
i brought it from amsterdam
ihave an indulgence
it was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individual lyth at inthe presence of such earnest purpose as the professor 's a purpose which could thus use the to him most sacred of things it was impossible to distrust
in respect ful silence we took the place sassi gne dto us closer ound the tomb but hidden from the sight of anyone approaching
ipit ie dthe other ses pecially arthur
i had myself been apprentice dby my former visit sto this watching horror and yet i who had upto an hour ago repudiated the proof sfe ltm yhe arts in kwi thin me
never did to mbs looks og has tly white
never did cypress or yew or juniper so seem the embodiment of funeral gloom
never did tree or grass wave or rustle so ominously
never did bough creaks omy steri ously and never did the faraway howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night
the rewa salon gsp ello fsi lence big aching void and the nfr omt he professor ake en ssss
he pointed and far down the avenue of yew swes a waw hit efi gure advance adi mwh it efi gure which he lds ome thing dark at its breast
the figures to ppe dan dat the moment ara yof moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence adar khair ed woman dressed in the cere ments of the grave
we could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair hair edc hild
the rewa sapa use and as harp little cry such as a child gives inslee por ado gas it lies before the fire and dreams
we were starting forward but the professor 's warning hands een by us ashes to odb ehi nda yew tree kept us back
and the nasw elook edt he white figure moved forward saga in
it was now near enough for us to see clearly and the moonlight still held
my own heart grew cold as ice and i could hear the gas po far thu ras were cogni zed the features of lucy westenra
lucy westenra but yet how changed
the sweetness was turned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness
van helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture we all advanced to o
the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb
van helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide
by the concentrated light that fell on lucy 's face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over her china nds tained the purity of her lawn death robe
we shuddered with horror
ico uld see by the tremulous light that even van helsing 's iron nerve had failed
arthur was next to mean dif iha dno tse ized his arm and held him up he would have fallen
when lucy ical lthe thing that was before us lucy because it bore her shapes awu ssh ed re wba ck with an angry snarls uch as a cat gives when taken unaware sthe nh ere yes range dover us
lucy 's eyes inform and colour but lucy 's eyes unclean and full of hellfire instead of the pure gentle or bsw ek new
at that moment there mna nto fm yl ove passed into hate and loathing
had she then to be killed ico uld have done it with savage delight
as she looked here yes blazed with unholy light and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous smile
oh god how it made me shudder to see it
with a careless motion she flung to the ground call ousa sade vil the child that upton ows he had clutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a dog growls over a bone
the child gave a sharp cryan dla ythe remo an in g
the rewa saco ldb loo de dnes sin the act which wrung agro an from arthur
when she advanced to him without stretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hid his face in his hands
she still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous grace said come to me arthur
leave the seo the rsa ndc ome to me
my arms are hungry for you
come and we can rest together
come my husband come
the rewa sso meth in gdi a bolic all ys we et in her to ness ome thing of the tinkling of glass when struck which ran gth rough the brain seven of us who heard the words address edt oan other
as for arthur he seemed under aspell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms
she was leaping for the mwh env an helsing sprang forward and held between the mhi slit tle golden crucifix
she recoiled from it and with a sudden lyd is to rte dfa cef ull of rage dashed past him as if to enter the tomb
when within a foot or two of the door however she stopped as if arrested by some irresistible force
the nsh et urn edan dhe rfa ce was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and bythe lamp which had no wno quiver from van helsing 's nerves
never did is ees uch baffled malice on a face and never it rust shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes
the beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire the browswer ewr in kle das thought he folds of flesh were the coils of medusa 's snakes and the lovely bloodstained mouth grew to an open square asin the passion masks of the greeks and japanese
if ever afac emea ntd eat hi flook sco uld kill we saw it at that moment
and so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing of her means of entry
van helsing broke the silence by asking arthur answer me oh my friend
amit opr oce edin my work
do as you will friend
do as you will
the rec an ben oh or ror like this ever anymore
and he groaned in spirit
quincey and is imu lta neously moved to ward shima ndt ook his arms
we could hear the click ofthe closing lantern as van helsing held it down
coming close to the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed the re
we all looked on with horrified amazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporeal body as real att ha tmo men tas our own passthrough the inter stice where scarce a knife blade could have gone
we all felt a glad sense of relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door
when this was done heli fte dthe child and said come now my friends
we can do no more till tomorrow
the reis a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that
the friends of the dead will all begone by two and when the sexton locks the gate we shall remain
the nth ere is more to do but not like this oft on ight
as for this little one he is not much harm edan dby tomorrow night he shall be well
we shall leave him where the police will find him as onthe other night and the nto home
coming close to arthur he said my friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look back you will see how it was necessary
you are now in the bitter water sm ych il d
by this time tomorrow you will please go dha vep assed the man dha ved run kof the sweetwater s
so do not mourn over much
till the nisha lln ota sky out of org ive me
arthur and quincey came home with mean dwe tried to cheer eachother on the way
we had left behind the child in safety and were tired
so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep
september night
alittle before twelve o'clock we three arthur quincey morris and myself called for the professor
it was odd to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes
ofcourse arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but there sto fus wore it by instinct
we got to the graveyard by half past one and strolled about keeping out of official observations otha twh ent he gravedigger shad completed the irt ask and the sexton under the belief that everyone had gone hadlock edt he gate we had the place all too urs elves
van helsing instead of his little black bag had with him along leather one something like a cricket in gba g
it was manifestly of fair weight
when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die out up the road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed the professor to the tomb
he unlocked the door and we entered closing it behind us
the nhe to okf rom his bag the lantern which he lit and also two wax candles which when light edhe stuck by melting the irow nen dso not her coffin sso that the ym ight give light sufficient to work by
when he again lifted the lido ffl uc y 's coffin we all looked arthur trembling like an aspen and saw that the corpse lay there in all its death beauty
but there was no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucy 's shape without her soul
ico uld see even arthur 's face grow hard as he looked
presently he said to van helsing is this really lucy 's body or only a demon in her shape
it is her body and yet not it
but wait awhile and you shall see her ass he was an dis
she seemed like an ight mar eof lucy as she lay there the point edt eet hthe bloodstained voluptuous mouth which made on esh udder to see the whole car nala nd unsp irit eda ppe aran ces eem in gli kea devilish mockery of lucy 's sweet purity
van helsing with his usual method ical ness began taking the various content sfr omh is bagan dpl acing the mre a dyf or use
first he took out as older in girona nds ome plumbing solder and the nsm all oil lamp which gave out when lit in acorn ero fthe to mbg as which burned at a fierce heat with a blue flame the nhis operating knives which he placed to hand and last around wooden stakes ome two and a half or three inches thick and about three feet long
one end of it was hardened by charring in the fire and was sharpened to a fine point
with this stake came a heavy hammers uch asin households is used in the coal cellar for breaking the lumps
to me a doctor 's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing but the effect of the set hing son both arthur and quincey was to cause the maso rto fcon stern ation
the yb oth however kept the irc our age and remained silent and quiet
when all was ready van helsing said before we do anything let me tell you this
it is out of the lore and experience of the ancient sand of all those who have studied the power soft he undead
when the ybe comes uch the recom es with the change the curse of immortality
the yca nno tdi ebu tm us tgo on a gea fter age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world
for all that die from the preying of the undead become the mse lve sun dead and pre yon the irk in d
and so the circle goes on ever widening like a sthe ripples from aston eth row ninth ewa ter
friend arthur ifyou had met that kiss which you know of before poor lucy die or again last night when you open your arms to her you would intime when you had died have become nosferatu as the yca lli tinea stern european dwo uld for all time make more of those undead sth at soha vef ill edu swith horror
the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun
those children whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much the worse but if she lives on undead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over the mthe yc ome to her and so she draw the irb loo dwi tht hats owi cked mouth
but if she die in truth the nall cease
the tiny wounds of the throat sdi sapp ear and the ygo back to the irp lay unknowing ever of what has been
but ofthe most blessed of all when this now undead be made to rest as true dead the nth eso ulo fthe poor lady who mwe love shall again be free
instead of working wickedness by night and growing more debased in the assimilating of it by day she shall take her place with the other angels
so that my friend it will be able ssed hand for her that shall strike the blow that sets her free
to this iam willing but is the reno nea mon gst us who has a better right
will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not ' it was my hand that sent her to the stars
it was the hand of him that love dhe rbe stth eha ndt hat of all she would herself have chosen had it been to her to choose
' tell me if the rebe such a one amongst us
we all looked at arthur
he saw too what we all did the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore lucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory
he stepped forward and said bravely though his hand trembl edan dhis face was a spa leas snow my true friend from the bottom of my broken heart it hanky ou
tell me what i am to do and is hall not falter
van helsing laid a hand on his shoulder and said brave lad
amo men t 's courage and it is done
this stake must be driven through her
it well be a fearful or deal be not deceived in that but it will be only as hort time and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great

his face was set and high duty seemed to shine through it
the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault
and the nth ewr it hing and quivering of the body became less and the teeth seemed to champ and the face to quiver
finally it lays till
the terrible task was over
the hammer fell from arthur 's hand
here eled and would have fallen had we not caught him
the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead and his breath came in broken gasps
it had indeed been an awful strain on him and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it
for a few minutes we were so take nup with him that we did not look towards the coffin
when we did however am urm uro fst art leds urp rise ran from one to the other of us

van helsing came and laid his hand on arthur 's shoulder and said to him and now arthur my friend dear lada minot for given
the reaction of the terrible strain came as he took the old man 's hand in his and raising it to his lips pressed it and said forgiven
god bless you that you have given my dear one hers oul again and me peace
he put his hands on the professor 's shoulder and laying his head on his breast cried for awhile silently whilst we stood unmoving
when he raised his head van helsing said to him and now my child you may kiss her
kiss her dead lips ifyou will ass he would have you to iff or her to choose
for she is not agri nni ng devil now not anymore afoul thing for all eternity

when the professor locked the door he gave the key to arthur

he then made ready for his departure and shortly drove off to liverpool street

i got her luggage which included at ype writer and we took the underground to fenchurch street after i had sent a wire to my house keeper to have a sitting room and abed room prepared at once for mrs

to my intense surprise there was no one with him
he was quite alone and onthe table opposite him was what i knew at once from the description to be a phonograph
i had never seen on eand was much interested

the fact is he began awkwardly ion lyke epm ydi ary in it and as it is entirely almost entirely about my case sit maybe awkward that is imea n
he stopped and it ried to help him out of his embarrassment

let me hear how she died for all that iknow of her is hall be very grateful
she was very very dear to me
to my surprise he answered with a horror struck look in his face tell you of her death
not for the wide world
why not
ias ked for some grave terrible feeling was coming over me
again he paused and i could see that he was trying to invent a nex cuse
at length he stammered out you see id on otk now howto pick out any particular part of the diary
even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he said with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the naivete of a child that 's quite true upon my honour
honest indian
ico uld not but smile at which he grimaced
i gave myself away that time
he said
but do you know that although i have kept the diary for months past it never once struck me how i was going to find any particular part of it in case iwan ted to look it up
by this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being and is a idb old lyth end r
seward you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter

poor dear lucy was right about him
he stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in order an umber of hollow cylinder so fme talco vered with dark wax and said you are quite right

seward 's diary september
iwas so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without thinking
mrs

she laid her hand on mine and said very gravely a hb utt hey must

but why

because it is a part of the terrible story apart of poor lucy 's death and all that led to it
because i nthe struggle which we have before us to rid the earth ofthis terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get

he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and i began to type write from the beginning of the seventeenth cylinder
i used manifold and so too kth re eco pies of the diary just as i had done with the rest
it was late when i got through but dr
seward went about his work of going his round of the patient s

how good and thoughtful he is
the world seems full of good men even if the rear emo nst ers in it

mr
harker arrived at nine o'clock
he got his wife 's wire just before starting
he is uncommon lyc lever if one can judge from his face and full of energy
if this journal be true and judging by one 's own wonderful experience sit must be heis also amano fgr eat nerve
that going down to the vault as econ dti me was a remarkable piece of daring
after reading his account of it iwas prepared to meet ago odsp eci men of manhood but hardly the quiet business like gentleman who came here to day
later
after lunch harker and his wife went back to the irow nro oman das ipass edaw hile ago i heard the click ofthe typewriter
the yare hard at it
mrs
harker says that the yare knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have
harker has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the carrier sin london who took charge of the m
he is now reading his wife 's transcript of my diary
iwon der what they make out of it
here it is
strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the count 's hiding place
goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient renfield
the bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the transcript
oh if we had only had the mea rli erw emi ght have saved poor lucy
stop
that way madness lies
harker has gone back and is again collecting material
he says that by dinnertime the yw ill be able to show a whole connected narrative
he thinks that in the meantime is hould see renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going ofthe count
i hardly see this yet but when i get a tthe date sisu ppos eis hall
what ago odt hing that mrs
harker put my cylinders in to type
we never could have found the date soth erwise
if ound renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded smiling benignly
atthe moment he seemed as sane as anyone ie versa w
is a tdo wna ndt al ked with him on alot of subjects all of which he treated naturally
he then of his own accord spoke of going home as ub ject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here
infact he spoke quite confident lyo fge tting his discharge at once
i believe that had in otha dthe chat with harker and read the letters and the date so fhi so ut bursts is hould have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation
as it is iam darkly suspicious
all those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the count
what the ndo est his absolute content mean
can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire 's ultimate triumph

he is himself zoo pha go usa ndi nhis wild ravings outside the chapel door of the desert ed house heal ways spoke of 'm aster '

the yall knew that i was busy and that my stay was short and mr
billington had read yin his office all the paper sconce rning the consignment of boxes
it gave me almost at urn to see again on eof the letters which i had seen on the count 's table before i knew of his diabolical plans
everything had been carefully thought out and done systematically and with precision
he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intention sbe in gca rri edo ut

he too put me at once in communication with the proper official sand is a wth a tthe irt all yw as correct with the original invoice
the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited

by good fortune the men who did the team in gwe re waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sending also by one of the mthe waybill and all the paper sco nne cted with the delivery of the boxes at carfax

dr
seward was out on business and had taken jonathan with him so i had to see the m
it was to me a painful meeting for it brought back all poor dear lucy 's hopes of only a few months ago

so they had to keep on neutral subject s
however it hough tthe matter over and came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post them on affairs right uptodate
i knew from dr
seward 's diary that the yha dbe en at lucy 's death her real death and that in eed not fear to be tray any secret before the time
so it old them as well as i could that i had read all the paper sand diaries and that my husband and i having typewritten the mha dj us tfi nished putting the minor der

in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief
it seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found avent at once
hegre wq uite hysterical and raising his open hands beat his palms together in a perfect agony of grief
he stood up and the nsa tdo wna gain and the tears rained down his cheeks
if elta nin finite pity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly
with a sob he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion
we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked
if elt this big sorrowing man 's head resting on me as though it were that of a baby that someday may lie on my bosom and is tro ked his hair as though he were my own child
in ever thought at the time how strange it all was
after alittle bit his sobs ceased and her aise dhi msel fwi than apology though he made no disguise of his emotion
he told me that for days and nights past wear yday sands lee pless night she had been unable to speak with anyone as a man must speak in his time of sorrow
the rewa snow oman whose sympathy could be given to him or with whom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded he could speak freely
iknow now how is uffe red he said as he dried his eyes but i do not know even yet and none other can ever know how much you rsw eet sympathy has been to me to day
is hall know better in time and believe me that though i am not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding
you will let me be like a brother will you not for all our lives for dear lucy 's sake
for dear lucy 's sake is a idas we clasped hands
ayan dfor your own sake head de df or if a man 's esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning you have won mine today
if ever the future should bring to you at ime when you need a man 's help believe me you will not call in vain
god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that you will let me know
he was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh that if elt it would comfort him so i said ipro mise
as icam eal on gthe corridor is a wmr
morris looking out of a window
he turned as he heard my footsteps
how is a rt
he said
the nno tic in gm yr edey esh ewen to nahi see you have been comforting him
poor old fellow
he needs it
noone but a woman can help aman when he is in trouble of the heart and he had no one to comfort him
he bore his own troubles obra vel yth at my heart bled for him
is a wthe manuscript in his hand and i knew that when he read it he would realize how much i knew so i said to him iwi shi could comfort all who suffer from the heart
will you let me be your friend and will you come to me for comfort ifyou need it
you will know later why is peak
he saw that i was in earnest and stooping to ok my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it
it seemed but poor comfort to sob rave and unselfish as oul and impulsive ly iben to vera nd kissed him
the tears rose in his eyes and the rewa sam omen tary choking in his throat
he said quite calm ly little girl you will never forget that true heart ed kindness solo nga sever you live
the nhe went into the study to his friend
little girl
the very words he had used to lucy and oh but he proved himself a friend
chapter dr
seward 's diary september
i got home at five o'clock and found that godalming and morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which harker had not yet returned from his visit to the carrier s 'm en of whom dr
hennessey had written to me
mrs
harker gave us acu po fte aand ican honestly say that for the first time since i have lived in it this old house seemed like home
when we had finished mrs
harker said dr
seward may ias kaf a vou r
iwan tto see your patient mr
renfield
dole tme see him
what you have said of him in your diary interests me so much
she looked so appealing and so pretty that i could not refuse her and the rewa sno possible reason why is hould so it ook her with me
when i went into the room it old them an that ala d yw ould like to see him to which he simply answer ed why
she is going through the house and wants to see everyone in it ian swer ed
oh very well he said let her come in by all means but just wait a minute till it id yup the place
his method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before i could stop him
it was quite evident that he feared or was jealous of some interference
when he had got through his disgusting task he said cheerfully let the lady come in and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her ass he entered
for a moment it hough tth at hemi ght have some homicidal intent
irem ember ed how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study and it ook care to stand where i could seize him at once if he attempted to make a spring at her
she came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command there spec to fan ylu nati cfor easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect
she walked over to him smiling pleasantly and held out her hand
good evening mr
renfield said she
you see iknow you for dr
seward has to ldm eof you
he made no immediate reply but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face
this look gave way to one of wonder which merged in doubt the nto myint ense astonishment he said you 're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry are you
you can ' tbe you know for she 's dead
mrs
harker smiled sweetly as she replied ohno
ihave a husband of my own to whom i was married before i ever saw dr
seward or heme
iam mrs
harker
the nw hat are you doing here
my husband and i are staying on a visit with dr
seward
the ndo n't stay
but why not
it hough tth at this style of conversation might not be pleasant to mrs
harker anymore than it was to me so i joined in how did you know i wanted to marry anyone
his reply was simply contemptuous given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from mrs
harker to me instantly turning the mba cka gain what an asinine question
id on ' tse eth at a tall mr
renfield said mrs
harker at once champion in gme
here plied to her with a smu chc our tes yand respect as he had shown contempt to me you will ofcourse understand mrs
harker that when amani sso love dan dho no ured as our host is everything regarding him is of interest in our little community
dr
seward is love dno to nly by his household and his friends but even by his patients who being some of the mha rd lyin mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects
since i myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum icann otb ut notice that the sophisti cte nde nci eso fso me of its inmates lean towards the error so fno nca usa and ignor at ioe lench e
ipos it ive lyo pened my eyes at this new development
here was my own pet lunatic the most pronounced of his type that i had ever met with talking element alph ilo sophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman
iwon der if it was mrs
harker 's presence which had to uche dso mech or dinh is memory
if this new phase was spontaneous or in anyway due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift or power
we continue dto talk for sometime and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioning lya ssh ebe gant olea dhi mto his favourite topic
iwasa gain astonished for headdress ed himself to the question with the impartiality of the complete sts an it y
he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things
why i myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief
indeed it was now on der that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being put under control
i used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity and that by consuming am ulti tude of live things noma tter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life
at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to take human life
the doctor here will be a rme out that on one occasion it ried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital power sby the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood relying ofcourse upon the scriptural phrase ' for the blood is the life
' though indeed the vendor of acer tain nostrum has vulgar ized the truism to the very point of contempt
isn't that true doctor
in odd edas sent for iwas so amazed that i hardly knew what to either think orsay it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before
looking at my watch is a wth a tish ould goto the station to meet van helsing so it old mrs
harker that it was time to leave
she came at once after saying pleasantly to mr
renfield goodbye and ihop eim ayse eyo uoft en under auspices pleasant ert oyo urself
to which to my astonishment here plied goodbye my dear
ipra ygo dima yn ever see your sweet face again
may he bless and keep you
when i went to the station to meet van helsing ile ftth ebo ys behind me
poor arts eem edmore cheerful than he has been since lucy first to oki llan dq uin ce yi smor eli kehi sown bright self than he has been for many along day
van helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager nimble ness of a boy
he saw me at once and rushed up to me saying a hfr iend john how goes all
well
so
ihave been busy for icom eher et osta yi fn eed be
all affairs are settled with mean di have much to tell
madam min ais with you
yes
and her so fine husband
and arthur and my friend quincey the yare with you to o
good
as i drove to the house it old him of what had passed and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through mrs
harker 's suggestion at which the professor interrupted me
ah that wonderful madam min a
she has man's brain abra in that aman should have were he much gifted and a woman 's heart
the good god fashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so good combination
friend john upton owf or tune has made that woman of help to us after tonight she must not have to do with this soter rib leaf fair
it is not good that she run a risk so great
we menar ed eterm in edna yare we not pledged to destroy this monster
but it is no part for a woman
even if she be not harmed her heart may fail her insomuch and so many horror sand hereafter she may suffer both in waking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams
and besides she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of sometime if not now
you tell me she has wrote all the nsh emus tcon sult with us but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work and we goal one
i agree dhea rti ly with him and the nito ldh im what we had found in his absence that the house which dracula had bought was the very next one to my own
he was amazed and agreat concerns eem edt oco me on him
oh that we had known it before
he said for the nwe might have reached him in time to save poor lucy
however ' the milk that is spilt cries not out afterwards ' as you say
we shall not think of that but goon our way to the end
the nhe fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway
before we went to prepare for dinner he said to mrs
harker iam to ldm adam min aby my friend john that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been up to this moment
not upto this moment professor she said impulsively but upto this morning
but why not upton ow
wehave seen hitherto how good light all the little things have made
wehave to ldo urs ecre tsa nd yet noone who has to ldist he worse for it
mrs
harker began to blush and taking a paper from her pocket ssh esa id dr
van helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in
it is my record of today
it ooh ave seen the need of putting down at present everything however trivial but there is little in this except what is personal
must it goin
the professor read it over gravely and handed it back saying it need not goin ifyou donot wish it but i pray that it may
it can but make your husband love you the more and all us your friends more honour you aswell as more esteem and love
she took it back with another blush and abri ght smile
and son owu pto this very hour all the records wehave are complete and inorder
the professor took away on ecopy to study after dinner and before our meeting which is fixed for nine o'clock
the rest of us have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy
min aha rke r 's journal september
when we met in dr
seward 's study two hours after dinner which had been at six o'clock we unconsciously for me das or to fbo ardor committee
professor van helsing to okt hehe ado fthe table to which dr
seward motion ed him as he came into the room
he made me sit next to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary
jonathan sat next to me
opposite us were lord god al ming dr
seward and mr
morris lord god al ming being next the professor and dr
seward in the centre
the professor said ima yi suppose take it that we are all acquainted with the fact sth at a rein the sepa per s
we all expressed as sent and he went on the nit were ithink good that it elly ous ome thing of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal
is hall the nmake known to you something of the history of this man which has been ascertained for me
soweth enca ndis cuss how we shall act and can take our measure according
the rear esu ch being sas vampires some of us have evidence that the ye xis t
even had we not the proof of our own unhappy experience the teaching sand there cords of the past give proof enough for san epe opl es
i admit that at the first iwas sceptic
were it not that through long years ihave trained myself to keep an open mind ico uld not have believed until such time as that fact thunder on my ear
's ee
see
ipro vei prove
' alas
had iknow nat first what now iknow nay had ie veng ues sat him on esop recio us life had been spared to many of us who did love her
but that is gone and we must sow or kth at other poor souls perish not whilst we can save
the nosferatu donot die like the bee when he sting once
he is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil
this vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is of cunning more than mortal for his cunning beth eg row tho fag esh eha vest ill the aids of necromancy which is a shi set ym ology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come night oare for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in callous and the heart of him is not he can within his range direct the elements the storm the fog the thunder he can command all the mean erth in gst her at and the owl and the bat the moth and the fox and the wolf he can grow and becomes mall and he can at times vanish and come unknown
how the nar ewe to begin our strike to destroy him
how shall we find his where and having found it how can we destroy
my friends this is much it is a terrible task that we undertake and the rema ybe consequence to make the braves hud der
for if we fail in this our fight he must surely win and the nw here end we
life is not hing sih eed him not
but to fail here is not mere life or death
it is that we become a shim that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him without heart or conscience preying on the bodies and the soul soft hose we love best
to us forever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open the mto usa gain
we go on for all time abhorred by all abl oto nthe face of god 's sunshine an arrow in the side of him who died for man
but we are facet of a cew it hdu tyan din such case must we shrink
for me is a yno but the nia mold and life with his sunshine his fair places his son go fbi rds his music and his love lie far behind
you other sare young
some have seen sorrow but there are fair days yet instore
what say you
whilst he was speaking jonathan had taken my hand
if eared oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i saw his hands tre tch out but it was life to me to feel it sto uch so strong so self reliant sores olu te
abra vem an 's hand can speak for itself it does not even need a woman 's love to hear it smu sic
when the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes and i in his there was none edf or speaking between us
ian swer for mina and myself he said
count me in professors aid mr
quincey morris laconic all yasu sual
iam with you said lord god al ming for lucy 's sake if for no other reason
dr
seward simply nodded
the professor stood up and after laying his golden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side
it ook his right hand and lord god al ming his left jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across to mr
morris
so as we all too khan dso urso lem nco mpact was made
if elt my heart icy cold but it did not even occur to me to drawback
were sumed our place sand dr
van helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun
it was to be taken as gravely and in a sbus in essl ikea way as an yot her transaction of life
well you know what we have to contend against but we too are not without strength
wehave on our side power of combination apo werden ie dto the vampire kind wehave sources of science wear efree to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are our sequal ly
infact sofa ras our power sex tend they are unfettered and wear efree to use the m
wehave self devotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not as elf is hone
the set hing sare much
now let us see how far the general powers array eda gains tusa re restrict and how the individual can not
in fine let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general and ofthis one in particular
all wehave to go up on a retr aditi on sands up erst it ions
the sedo not at the first appear much when the matter is one of life and death nay of more than either life or death
yet must web esat is fied in the first place because we have to be no other means is a tour control and secondly because after all the set hing strad it iona ndsu per sti tion are everything
does not the belief in vampires rest for other sth ough not alas
for us on the m
aye arago which of us would have received such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matter of fact nineteenth century
we even scouted abel ie ft hat we saw justified under our very eyes
take it then that the vampire and the belief in his limitations and his cure rest for the moment on the same base
for let me tell you heis known everywhere that men have been
in old greece in old rome he flourishing erman yall over infra nce in india even in the cher moses eand in china sofa rfr om us in all ways there even is he and the people sfor him at this day
he have follow the wake of the berserker iceland erth ed evil begotten hunt he slav the saxon the magyar
sofa rthe nwe have all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of the belief sare justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience
the vampire live on and can not die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living
even more wehave seen among stu sth at heca neven grow younger that his vital faculties grows tren uous and see mast hough the yr efr esh themselves when his special pab ulu mis plenty
but he can not flourish with out this diet he eat not as other s
even friend jonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see him eat never
he throws no shadow he make inthe mirror nor efl ect as a gain jonathan observe
he has the strength of many of his hand witness again jonathan when he shut the door against the wolves and when he help him from the diligence to o
he can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as bata smad am minas a whim on the window at whitby and as friend john saw him fly from this son ear house and as my friend quincey saw him at the window of miss lucy
he can come in mist which he create that noble ship 's captain proved him of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist is limited and it can only be round himself
he come on moonlight rays as elemental dust as a gain jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of dracula
he becomes osm all we ourselves saw miss lucy eres he was a tpe aces lip through a hair breadth space at the tomb door
he can when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it be bound or even fused up with fire solder you call it
he can see in the dark no small power this in a world which is one half shut from the light
ah but he arm eth rough
he can do all the set hing sye the isnot free
nay heise ven more prisoner than the slave of the galley than the madman in his cell
he can not go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature 's laws why we know not
he may not enter anywhere at the first unless the rebe someone ofthe household who bid him to come though afterwards he can come as he please
his power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day
only at certain times can he have limited freedom
if he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset
the set hing swear etol dandi nthis record of our swe have proof by inference
thus where as he can do as he will within his limit when he have his earth home his coffin home his hell home the place unh allowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come
it is said to otha the canon ly pass running water at the slack or the flood of the tide
the nth ere are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of an das for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was among stu seven now when we resolve to the mhe is not hing but in the irp res ence he take his place far off and silent with respect
the rear eot her sto ow hich is hall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need the m
the branch of wildrose on his coffin keep him that he move not from it as a cred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through him we know already ofits peace or the cutoff head that give thre st
wehave seen it with our eyes
thus when we find the habitation of this man that was we can confine him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know
but he is clever
ihave asked my friend arminius of budapest hun iversity to make his record and from all the means that are hete llm eof what he has been
he must indeed have been that voivod edra cul a who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkey land
if it be so the nwa she nocom mon man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of asthe cleverest and the most cunning aswell as the bravest of the sons of the ' land beyond the forest
' that might yb rain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave and are even now array eda gains tus
the dracula swer esa ysa rmin ius agreat and noble race though now and again were scion sw how ere he ldb ythe irc oe vals to have had dealings with the evil one
the yle arne dhis secrets in the scholomance amongst the mountains over lake herman stadt where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due
in the records are such words as 's trego ica ' witch ' or do g ' and ' poko l' satan and helland in one manuscript this very dracula is spoken of a s ' wamp yr ' which we all understand too well
the reha veb een from the loins of this very one great men and good women and the irg raves makes a credt he earth where alone this foul ness can dwell
for it is not the least of its terror sth at this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories it can not rest
whilst the yw ere talking mr
morris was looking steadily at the window and he now got up quietly and went out of the room
the rewa sali ttl epa use and the nth epr of esso rwe nto n
and now we must settle what we do
wehave here much data and we must proceed to layout our campaign
we know from the inquiry of jonathan that from the castle to whitby came fifty boxes of earth all of which were delivered at carfax we also know that atleast some of the sebo xes have been removed
it seems to me that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today or whether any more havebeen removed
if the latter we must trace
here we were interrupted in avery startling way
outside the house came the sound of apis to lsh ott he glass of the window was shattered with a bullet which ricochet ting from the top of the embr as ures truck the far wall of the room
iam a fraid iam a the art aco ward for is hri eked out
the men all jumped to the irf eet lord god al ming flew over to the window and threw up the sash
as he did so we heard mr
morris ' voice without sorry
if ear ihave alarmed you
is hall come in and tell you about it
amin ute later he came in and said it was an idiot ict hing of metodo and ias kyou rpa rd on mrs
harker most sincerely if ear imus tha vef right ened you terribly
but the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came abi gba tan dsa to nthe windows ill
ihave got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that icann ots tan dthe man di went out to have a shot as ihave been doing of late of evening sw he never ihave seen on e
you use dto laugh at me for it then art
did you hit it
asked dr
van helsing
id on ' tkn owi fancy not for it flew away into the wood
without saying anymore he took his seat and the professor began to resume his statement
we must trace each of the sebo xes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must soto speaks teri liz ethe earth so that no more he can see ksa fet yin it
thus in the end we may find him in his form of man between the hours of noonan dsu nset and so engage with him when he is a this most weak
and now for you madam min at his night is the end until all be well
you are too precious to us to have such risk
when we part tonight you no more must question
we shall tell you all in good time
we are menand are able to be a rb ut you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the dangers uch as we are
all the men even jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to me good that the ys hould brave danger and perhaps less ent heirs afety strength being the best safety through care of me but the irm in dsw ere made up and though it was a bitter pill form et os wall owi could say nothing save to accept the irc hiv alr ous care of me
mr
morris resume dthe discussion as the reis not imet olo sei vote wehave aloo kathi shouse right now
time is everything with him and swift action on our part may save another victim
i own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close but i did not say anything for iha dag re ater fear that if i appeared as a drag or a hindrance to the ir work they might even leave me out of the irc oun sels altogether
the yha veno wg on eof ft oca rfa xw it hme an sto get into the house
man like the yha dto ldm et ogo to be dan dsl eep as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger
is hall lied own and pretend to sleep lest jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns
dr
seward 's diary october a
m
just as we were about to leave the house an urgent message was brought to me from renfield to know if iwould see him at once a she had something of the utmost importance to say to me
it old themes senger to say that iwould attend to his wishes in the morning i was busy just a tthe moment
the attendant added he seems very importunate sir
ihave never seen him so eager
id on ' tkn owb ut what if you do n't see him soon he will have one of his violent fits
i knew the man would not have said this without some causes ois aid allright i'll go now and ias ked the other stow aita few minutes for me as i had to go and see my patient
take me with you friend john said the professor
his case in your diary interest me much and it had bearing to on owa nda gain on our case
is hould much like to see him and especial when his mind is disturbed
may icom eal so
asked lord god al ming

said quincey morris
may icom e
said harker
in odd edan dwe all went down the passage together
we found him in a state of considerable excitement but farm or eration ali nhis speech and manner than i had ever seen him
the rewa san unusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything i had ever met with in a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with other sent irel ysa ne
we all five went into the room but none of the other sat first said anything
his request was that iwould at once release him from the asylum and send him home
this he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his own existing sanity
iapp eal to your friends he said the yw ill perhaps not mind sitting in judgement on my case
by the way you have not introduced me
iwas so much astonished that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and besides the rewa sace rtai ndi gni ty in the man 's manners om uch of the habit of equality that i aton cema de the introduction lord god al ming professor van helsing mr

he was a man love dan dho no ured by all who knew him and in his youth was ihave heard the inventor of a burnt rump unch much patronized on derby night
mr
morris you should be proud of your great state
it sre ception into the union was a precedent which may have far reaching effects hereafter when the pole and the tropics may hold alliance to the stars and stripes
the power of treaty may yet prove avast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine takes its true place as apolitical fable
what shall any man say of his pleasure at meeting van helsing
sir imake no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix
when an individual has revolutionized the rape uti csb yh is discovery of the continuous evolution of brain matter conventional forms are unfit tings in cet hey would seem to limit him to one of aclass
you gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respective places in the moving world it ake to witness that i am ass an easa tle as tthe majority of men who are in full possession of the irl ibert ies
and iams ure that you dr
seward humanitarian and medico jurist aswell as scientist will deem it amoral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances
he made this last appeal with a court lya iro fcon vic tion which was not without its own charm
it hink we were all staggered
for my own part i was under the conviction despite my knowledge of the man 's character and history that his reason had been restored and if elt under astron gimp uls et otel lhi mth at iwas satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary for mali ties for his release in the morning
it hough tit better to wait however before making so grave as tatement for of old ikn ewt he sudden change stow hich this particular patient was liable
so icon tented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be improving very rapidly that iwould have a longer chat with him in the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction of meeting his wishes
this did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly but if ear dr
seward that you hardly apprehend my wish
ides iret ogo at once here now this very hour this very moment if i may
time presses and in our implied agreement with the old scythe man it is ofthe essence of the contract
iams urei tison lyne cess ary to put before so admirable apr act ition eras dr
seward so simple yet so momentous awis hto ensure its fulfilment
he looked at me keenly and seeing the negative in my face turned to the other sands crut in ized the mcl ose ly
not meeting any sufficient response he went on is it possible that ihave erred in my supposition
you have is a idf rank ly but at the same time as if elt brutally
the rewa saco nsider able pause and the nhes aids low lyth enis up pose imus to nly shift my ground of request
let me as kfor this concession boon privilege what you will
iam content to implore in such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of other s
iam not at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may ias sure you take it from me that the yare good ones sound and unselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty
could you look sirin to my heart you would approve to the full these nti ments which animate me
nay more you would count me amongst the best and true sto fy our friends
again he looked at usa ll keenly
i had a growing conviction that this sudden change of his entire intellectual method was but yet another phase of his madness and so determined to let him go on alittle longer knowing from experience that he would like all lunatics give himself away in the end
van helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost in tensity his bush yey ebro wsa lmos tme eting with the fixed concentration of his look
he said to renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time but only when it hough to fit afterwards for it was a so fone addressing an equal can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight
iwill undertake that if you will satisfy even meas trang erw ithout prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open mind dr
seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you see k
he shook his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face
the professor went on comes irb eth in kyou rse lf
you claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree since you see kto impress us with your complete reasonableness
you do this whose sanity wehave reason to doubt since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect
if you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put up on us
be wise and help us and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish
he still shook his head ashes aid dr
van helsing ihave nothing to say
your argument is complete and if i were free to speak is hould not hesitate am omen tbu tia mno tm yow nmas teri nthe matter
ican only as kyou to trust me
if i am refused the responsibility does not rest with me
it hough tit was now time to end the scene which was becoming too comically graves oi went to ward sthe doors imply saying come my friends wehave work to do
goodnight
as however i got near the door an ewch an gec am eo vert hepa tient
he moved to ward smes oq uic kl yth at fort he moment if eared that he was about to make another homicidal attack
my fears however were groundless for hehe ldu phi st woh and simpl or in gly and made his petition in a moving manner
ashes a wth a tthe very excess of his emotion was mili tating against him by restoring us more to our old relations he became still more demonstrative
i glanced at van helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so i became a little more fixed in my manner if not more stern and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing
i had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which atthe time he had thought much such for instance as when he wanted a cat and iwas prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence on this occasion
my expectation was not realize dfor when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got into quite a frantic condition
he threw himself on his knees and held up his hands wringing the min plaintive supplication and poured forth at or rent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his whole face and for me xpress ive of the deepest emotion
let me entreaty oud r
seward oh let me implore you to let me out of this house at once
send me away how you will and where you will send keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in astra it waistcoat man acle dan dleg ironed event oga olb ut let me go out of this
you do n't know what you do by keeping me here

you do n't know who my ou wrong or how and i may not tell
woe is me
ima ynot tell
by all you hold sacred by all you hold dear by your love that is lost by your hope that lives for the sake of the almighty take me out of this and save my soul from guilt

will you never learn
don't you know that i am san eand earnest now that i am no lunatic in a mad fit but as an eman fighting for his soul
oh hear me

let me go let me go let me go
it hough tth at the longer this went on the wild erh ewo uld get an dso would bring on a fit so it ook him by the hand and raised him up
come is a ids tern lyn omo re ofthis wehave had quite enough already
get to your bed and try to be have more discreet ly
he suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments
the nwi thou taw or dhe rose and moving over sat down on the side of the bed
the collapse had come as on former occasions just as i had expected
when i was leaving the room last of our party he said to me in a quiet well bred voice you will it rust dr
seward dome the justice to be a rin mind later on that i did what i could to convince you tonight

i went with the party to the search with an easy mind for it hink in ever saw minas oab solute lys trong and well
iams ogl adt hats he consented to hold back and let us men do the work
somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all but now that he rwork is done and that it is due to her energy and brain sand foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells she may well feel that he rpa rti sfi nished and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us
we were ithink all alittle upset by the scene with mr
renfield
when we came away from his room we were silent till we got back to the study
the nmr
morris said to dr
seward say jack if that man was n't attempting a bluff he is about the san est lunatic ie versa w
i 'm not sure but i believe that he had some serious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance
lord god al ming and i were silent but dr
van helsing added friend john you know more lunatics than i do and i 'm glad of it for if earth at if it had been to me to decide iwould before that last hysterical outburst have given him free
but we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would say
all is best asthe yare
dr
seward seemed to answer the mbo thin adr eam yk in dof way i do n't know but that i agree with you
if that man had been an ordinary lunatic iwould have taken my chance of trusting him but he seems so mixed up with the count in an index yk in dof way that i am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads
ican ' tfor get how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat and the ntr ie dto tear my throat outwith his teeth
besides he called the count ' lord and master ' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way
that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him so i suppose he is n't above trying to use are spec table lunatic
he certainly did seem earnest though
ion lyh ope wehave done what is best
the set hing sin conjunction with the wild work wehave in hand help to unnerve aman
the professor stepped over and laying his hand on his shoulders aid in his grave kindly way friend john have no fear
we are trying to do our duty in avery sadan dte rri ble case we can only do as we deem best
what else have we to hope for except the pity of the good god
lord god al ming had slipped away for a few minutes but nowhere turned

having passed the wall wet ook our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the law nw he nthe moonlight shone out
when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out alot of things which he laid on the steps orting the mint of our little groups evidently one for each
the nhes poke
my friends wear ego in ginto at err ible danger and we need arms of many kinds
our enemy is not merely spiritual
remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that though our necks or our windpipe sare of the common kind and therefore breakable or crushable his are not amenable to merest re ngt h
astron german or a body of men more strong in all thanh imc an atc ert ain times hold him but the yca nno thu rth imas we can be hurt by him
we must therefore guard ourselves from his touch

this was a portion of sacred wafer which he put in an envelope and handed to me
each of the other swa ssi mila rly equipped
now he said friend john where are the skeleton key s
if so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before atm is slu cy 's
dr
seward tried one or two skeletonkey shi smec hani cal dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead
presently he got one to suit after alittle playback and forward the bolt yielded a nd with a rusty clangs hot back
we pressed on the door the rusty hinges creaked and its low lyo pened
it was startling ly like the image conveyed to me in dr
seward 's diary of the opening of miss westenra 's tomb ifanc yth at the same ideas eem edt ostr ike the other sfor with one accord the ys hra nkb ack
the professor was the first to move forward and stepped into the open door
in man us tuas domine
he said crossing himself as he passed over the threshold
we closed the door behind us lest when we should have lit our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road
the professor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit
the nwea llli to url amps and proceeded on our search
the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd for msas the rays crossed eachother or the opacity of our bodies threw great shadows
ico uld not for my life getaway from the feeling that the rewa sso me one else amongst us
is up pose it was the recollections op ower fully brought home to me by the grim surrounding soft hatter rib lee xperience in transylvania
it hink the feeling was common to us all for in otice dth at the other ske ptl ooking over the irs hould ersa tev ery sound and every new shadow just as if elt myself doing
the whole place was thick with dust
the floor was seemingly inches deep except where the re were recent footsteps in which onhold in gdo wn my lamp ico uld see marks of hobnail sw here the dust was cracked
the walls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corner swer emas ses of spider 's web sw here on the dust had gathered till the yl ook ed like old tattered rags as the weight had to rnt hemp art lyd own
on a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys with a time yellow ed label on each

i had an idea of its direction though on my former visit iha dno tbe enable to get admission to its oil edt he wayan daft era few wrong turn in gsf ound myself opposite alow arched oaken door ribbed with iron bands
this is the spot said the professor ashe turned his lamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase
with alittle trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door
we were prepared for some unpleasant ness for a swe were opening the door afa in tma lodo rous air seemed to exhale through the gaps but none of use vere xp ected such an odour as we encountered
none of the other shad met the count at all at close quarters and when i had seen him he was either in the fasting stage of his existence in his room so rw he nh ewa sbl oat ed with fresh blood in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul
the rewa san earth ysm ella so fso med ry miasma which came through the foul era ir
but as to the odour itself how shall ides crib eit
it was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption had become itself corrupt

it sickens me to think of it
every breath exhaled by that monsters eem edt oh avec lung tothe place and intensified its loathsome ness
under ordinary circumstances such as tench would have brought our enterprise to an end but this was no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us as treng th which rose above merely physical considerations
after the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous whiff we one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were agard en of roses
we made an accurate examination of the place the professor saying as we began the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we can not get some clue as to what has become ofthe rest
agl an cew as sufficient to show how many remained for the great earth chest swer ebu lk yand the rewa snom is taking the m

the rewa sno sign of anyone and as the re were no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solid walls of the passage there could be no hiding place even for him
it ook it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing
afew minutes later is a wmo rri sst eps ud den ly back from acorn erw hich he was examining
we all followed his movements with our eyes for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkle dli kest ars
we all instinctively drew back
the whole place was becoming a live with rats
for a moment or two west ood appalled all save lord god al mingw how ass eem in gly prepared for such an emergency
rushing over to the great ironbound oaken door which dr
seward had described from the outside and which i had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolts and swung the door open
the nta king his little silver whistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call
it was answered from behind dr
seward 's house by the yelping of dogs and after about amin ute three terriers came dashing round the corner of the house
unconsciously we had all moved to ward sthe door and as we moved in otice dth at the dust had been much disturbed
the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way
but even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased
the ys eem edt os warm over the place all at once till the lamplight shining on the irmo ving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies
the dogs dashed on but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled and the nsi multan eou sly lifting the irno ses began to howlin most lugubrious fashion
the rats were multiplying in thousands and we moved out
lord god al ming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in place dhi month efl oor
the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies
the yf led before him sofas tth at before he had shaken the life out of a score the other dogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small prey ere the whole mass had vanished
with the irg oing its eem edas if some evil presence had departed for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as the yma des ud den darts at the irp rost rate foes and turned the move rand over and tossed the mint he air with vicious shakes
we all seemed to find our spirits rise
whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door or the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open iknow not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something of its grim significance though we did not slack en awh it in our resolution
we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bringing the dogs with us began our search of the house
we found nothing throughout except dustin extraordinary proportion sandal lunt ouch eds ave for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit

more than all do i rejoice that this our first and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous step has been accomplished without the bringing the rein to our most sweet madam min aor troubling her waking or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget
one lesson to owe have learned if it be allowable to argue apart icu lari that the brute beasts which are to the count 's command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look the sera tst hat would come to his call just as from his castle to phe summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother 's cry thought he yc ome to him the yr un pell me ll from the soli ttl edo gso fm yf rien darth ur

it has given us opportunity to cry ' check ' in some ways in this chess game which we play for the stake of human soul s
and now let us gohome
the dawn is close at hand and we have reason to be content with our first night 's work
it may be ordained that we have many nights and days to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from noda nger shall we shrink
the house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant wards and a low moaning sound from renfield 's room

dr
seward 's diary october
it was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor walking into my room
he was more jolly and cheerful than usual and it is quite evident that last night 's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight of fhi smi nd
after going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said you rpa tient interests me much
may it be that with you ivis it him this morning
or if that you are too occupy ican goal one if it may be
it is an ewe xperience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reasons oso und
i had some work to do which press eds oit old him that if he would goal one iwould be glad asthe nish ould not have to keep him waiting so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions
before the professor left the room ica ution ed him against getting any false impression from my patient
but he answered iwan thi mto talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things
he said to madam min aas is eei ny our diary of yesterday that he had once had such a belief
why do you smile friend john
excuse me is a idb utt he answer is here
i laid my hand on the typewritten matter
when our san eand learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before mrs
harker entered the room
van helsing smiled in turn
good
he said
your memory is true friend john
is hould have remembered
and yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes me nt aldis ease such a fascinating study
perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than is hall from the teaching of the most wise
who knows
i went on with my work and before long was through that in hand
it seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there was van helsing back in the study
do i interrupt
he asked politely as he stood at the door
not at all ian swer ed
come in
my work is finished and i am free
ican go with you now if you like
it is needless ihave seen him
well
if earth at hedo esn ota ppr aise meat much
our interview was short
when i entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre with his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen discontent
is poket ohim as cheerfully as i could and with such a measure of respect as i could assume
he made noreply whatever
'd on ' tyo uk now me
' ias ked
his answer was not reassuring ' iknow you well enough you are the old fool van helsing
i wish you would take your self and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else
damn all thick head edd utc hme n
' not a word more would he say but satin his implacable sullen ness asin different to me as though i had not been in the room at all
thus departed for this time my chance of much learning from this soc lever lunatics ois hall go if i may and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul madam min a
friend john it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to be worried with our terrible things
though we shall much miss her help it is better so
i agree with you with all my heart ian swer edea rne stl yfor id id not want him to weaken in this matter
mrs
harker is better out of it
things are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who have been in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a woman and if she had remained in touch with the affair it would intime infallibly have wrecked her
so van helsing has gone to confer with mrs
harker and harker quincey and art are all out following up the clues as to the earth boxes
is hall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight
min aha rke r 's journal october
it is strange to me to be kept in the dark asia mto day after jonathan 's full confidence for soma ny years to see him manifestly avoid certain matters and those them ost vital of all
this morning is lept late after the fatigue so fye ster day and though jonathan was late to ohe was the earlier
he spoke to me before he went out nevermore sweet lyo rte nder ly but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the count 's house
and yet he must have known how terribly anxious iwas
poor dear fellow
is up pose it must have distressed him even more than it did me
the yall agreed that it was best that is hould not be drawn further into this awful work and i acquiesced
but to think that he keeps anything from me
and now i am crying like a silly fool when i know it comes from my husband 's great love and from the good good wishes of those other strong men
that has done me good
well someday jonathan will tell me all
and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i kept anything from him is till keep myjournal asus ual
the nif he has feared of my trust is hall show it to him with every thought of my heart put down for his dear eyes to read
if eels trang elysa dan dlo wsp irit edt oday
is up pose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement
last night i went to be dwh ent he men had gone simply because they told me to
id id n't feels lee pya ndi did feel full of devouring a nxi et y
ike ptt hink in gover everything that has been ever since jonathan came to see me in london and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fate pressing on relentlessly to some destined end
everything that one does seem snom at ter how right it may be to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored
if i had n't gone to whitby perhaps poor dear lucy would be with us now
she had n't taken to visit in gthe churchyard till i came and if she had n't come there in the daytime with mesh ewo uld n't have walked in her sleep
and if she had n't gone there at night and asleep that monster could n't have destroyed her as he did
oh why did i ever got ow hit by
the reno wcr ying again
iwon der what has come over me to day
imus thi de it from jonathan for if he knew that i had been crying twice in one morning
i who never cried on my own account and who mhe has never caused to shed at earth edea rfe llow would fret his heart out
is hall put a boldface on and if i do feel we ep yhe shall never see it
is up pose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn
ican ' t quite remember how i fell asleep lastnight
irem ember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and alot of queer sounds like praying on avery tumultuous scale from mr
renfield 's room which is somewhere under this
and the nth ere was silence over everything silence so profound that it startled me and i got up and looked out of the window
all was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeming full of a silent mystery of the irow n
not at hing seemed to be stirring but all to be grim and fixed as death or fates otha tat hin streak of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and avital it yof its own
it hink that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good for when i got back to be dif ound aletha rg yc re epi ngo ver me
i lay awhile but could not quite sleeps oig oto utan dlo ok edo uto fthe window again
the mist was spreading and was now close up to the house so that i could see it lying thick against the wall as though it were stealing upto the windows
the poor man was more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he said i could in some way recognize in his tone sso me passionate entreaty on his part
the nth ere was the sound of a struggle and i knew that the attendant swer edea ling with him
iwas so frightened that i crept into bed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my ears
iwas not the nabi tsl eep yat least so it hough tbu tim us tha vef all enas lee pfor except dreams id on otr eme mber anything until the morning when jonathan woke me
it hink that it took me an effort and alittle time to realize where i was an dth at it was jonathan who was bending over me
my dream was very peculiar and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in or continue din dreams
it hough tth at iwasa sleep and waiting for jonathan to come back
iwas very anxious about him and iwas powerless to act my feet and my hands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at the usual pace
and so i slept uneasily and thought
the nit began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy and dan kand cold
iput back the clothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dim around
the gaslight which i had left lit for jonathan but turned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room
the nito ccu rre dto meth at iha dsh utt he window before i had come to be d
iwould have got out to make certain onthe point but some lead en lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will
i lay still and endured that was all
i closed my eyes but could still see through my eyelids
it is wonderful what tricks our dreams play usa nd how convenient ly we can imagine
the mist grew thicker and thicker and i could see now how it came in for ico uld see it like smoke or with the white energy of boiling water pouring in not through the window but through the joining soft he door
it got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it became concentrated in to as orto fpi lla rof cloud in the room through the top of which i could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye
things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloud yc olu mn was now whirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words api lla rof cloud by day and off ire by night
was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming to me in my sleep
but the pillar was composed of both the day and the night guiding for the fire was in the red eye which atthe thought got a new fascination for me till as i looked the fire divided and seemed to shine on meth rough the fog like two redeye ssu chas lucy told me of inher momentary mental wandering when onthe cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of st
mary 's church
suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight and in my dream imus tha vef ain t ed for all became black darkness
the last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist
imus tbe careful of such dreams for the yw ould unseat one 's reason i fthe re were too much of the m
iwould get dr
van helsing or dr
seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep on lyth at if ear to alarm the m
such a dream at the present time would be come woven into the irf ears for me

chapter jonathan harker 's journal october evening
if ound thomas snelling in his house at bethnal green but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything
the very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved to om uch and he had begun to oea rly on his expected debauch
ile a rne dhow ever from his wife whose emed adec ent poor soul that he was only the assistant of smo lle twh oof the two mates was the responsible person
so off id rove to walworth and found mr
joseph smo lle tat home and in his shirt sleeves taking a late tea out of a saucer
he is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly ago odr eliab let ype of work man and with ahead piece of his own
here member eda lla bout the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful dog ear edn ote book which he produced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphic alent ries in thick half obliterated pencil he gave me the destination soft he boxes
the re were he said six in the car tlo a dwh ich he took from carfax and left at chicks and street mile end newtown and another six which he deposited at jamaica lane bermondsey
if the nth eco unt meant to scatter the seg has tly refuge so fhi sover london these places were chosen as the first of delivery soth at later he might distribute more fully
the systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london
he was now fixed on the fareast on the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and onthe south
the north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme let alone the city itself and the very heart of fashionable london in the southwest and west
i went back to smo lle tanda sked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from carfax
here plied well guv ' no ryou 've treated me very ' an 's ome iha dgi ven him half as over eign an i'll tell ye rall iknow
i heard a man by the name of blox am say four nights ago in the ' area n ' ' ound sin pincher 's all ey as ' ow he an ' his mate ' ad ' adara red us ty job in a old ' ouse at purfleet
the rea in ' taman ysu ch jobs as this ' ere an ' i 'm thinkin ' that maybe sam blox am could tell yes umm ut
ias ked if he could tell me where to find him
it old him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half sovereign to him
so he gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the search the nand the re
atthe door he stopped and said look ' ere guv ' north ere ain ' tno sense in me a keepin ' you ' ere
ima yf in dsa mso on or ima yn ' tbu tan yh ow he ain ' tli keto be in a way to tell ye much tonight
sami sara re one when he starts on the booze
if you can give me a envelope with a stamp on it and put yer address on it i'll find out where sam is to be found and post it yet on ight
but ye 'd better be up art er ' ims oon in the mornin ' nevermind the booze the night afore
this was all practical soon eof the children went off with a penny to buy a nen velop eand as he eto fpa per and to keep the change
when she came back iad dressed the envelope and stamped it and when smo lle thad again faithfully promised to post the address when found it ook myway to home
we 're on the track anyhow
iam tired tonight and iwan tto sleep
min ais fast asleep and looks alittle to opal e
here yes look as though she had been crying
poor dear i've no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the other s
but it is best as it is
it is better to be disappointed and worried in such a way now than to have her nerve broken
the doctor swer equi teri ght to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business
imus tbe firm for on meth is particular burden of silence must rest
is hall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances
indeed it may not be a hard task after all for she herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the count or his doings ever since we told her of our decision
october evening along and trying and exciting day
by the first post igo tm ydi rected envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed on which was written with a carpenter 's pencil in a sprawling hands am blox amkor kra nsp ote rsc or tba rte lst re etwa lwo rth
ars kfor the depit e
i got the letter in bed and rose without waking min a
she looked heavy and sleep yand pale and far from well
ide termined not to wake her butt hat when i should return from this news earch iwould arrange for her going back to exeter
it hinks he would be happier in our own home with her daily tasks to interest hertha nin being here amongst us and in ignorance
ion lys a wdr
seward for a moment and told him where i was off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as is hould have found out anything
id rove to walworth and found with some difficulty potter 's court
mr
smo lle t 's spelling misled meas ias ked for poter 's court instead of potter 's court
however when i had found the court iha dno difficult yin discovering corcoran 's lodging house
when i asked the man who came to the door for the depit ehe shook his head and said id un no ' im
the rea in ' tno such a person ' ere
in ever ' ear do f ' imin all my bloomin ' days
don't believe there a in't nobody of that kind livin ' ' ere or anywhere s
it ook out smo lle t 's letter and as i read it its eem edt ome that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me
what are you
ias ked
i 'm the depit yhe answered
is a wat once that i was on the right track
phone tics pelling had again misled me
aha lfc row nti pp utt he deputy 's knowledge at my disposal and i learned that mr
blox am who had slept of fthe remains of his beer on the previous night at corcoran 's had left for his work at poplar at five o'clock that morning
he could not tell me where the place of work was situated but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of an ew fangled war e ' usa nd with this slender clue iha dto start for poplar
it was twelve o'clock before i got any satisfactory hint of such a building and this igo tata coffeeshop where some work men were having the ird inner
one of the msu gge ste d that the rewa sbe in gere cted at cross angels tree tan ewc old storage building and as this suited the condition of an ew fangled war e ' us iat once drove to it
an interview with a surly gatekeeper and as url ie rfor eman both of whom were appeased with the coin of the real mpu tme on the track of blox am
he was sent for on my suggestion that i was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on apr iva temat ter
he was a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing
when i had promised to pay for his information and given him an earnest he told me that he had made two journey sbe tween carfax and a house in piccadilly and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes main heavy on esw it hah or sean dcar thir ed by him for this purpose
ias ked him if he could tell me the number of the house in piccadilly to which he replied well guv ' no rif or gits the number but it was only a few door from a big white church or somethin kof the kind not long built
it was a dusty old ' ouse to otho ugh not hin ' to the dustin esso fthe ' ouse we took edt he bloomin ' boxes from
how did you get in if both houses were empty

why ' eto ok up ' is endo ' the boxes like the yw as pounds of tea and me a puffin ' an ' abl owi n'a for eic ould upend mine anyhow an ' i 'm no chicken neither
how did you get into the house in piccadilly

it hough tth at with this description ico uld find the house so having paid my friend for his information is tarte do fff or piccadilly
i had gained an ew painful experience
the count could it was evident handle the earth boxes himself
if so time was precious for now that he had achieved acer taina mount of distribution he could by choosing his own time complete the task unobserved
at piccadilly circus idis charged my caban dwa lke dwes twa rd
beyond the junior constitutional icam eac ross the house described and was satisfied that this was the next ofthe lairs arranged by dracula
the house looked as though it had been long unten an ted
the windows were encrusted with dust and the shutter swer eu p
all the framework was black with time and from the iron the paint had mostly scale dawa y
it was evident that upto lately there had been a large noticeboard infront of the balcony
it had however been roughly to rna way the uprights which had supported its till remaining
behind the rails of the balcony is a wthe re were some loose boards whose raw edges looked white
iwould have given a good deal to have been able to see the noticeboard intact as it would perhaps have given some clue to the ownership of the house
irem ember edm ye xperience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could not but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house
the rewa sat present nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side and nothing could be done so i went around to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter
the mews were active the piccadilly house sbe in gmos tly in occupation
ias kedo neo rtw oof the groom sand help ers who misawa round ifthe yc ould tell me anything about the empty house
one of the msa id that he heard it had lately been taken but he could n't say from whom
he told me however that upto very late lyth ere had been an otice board of forsale up and that perhaps mitchell sons can dy the house agents could tell me something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board
id id not wish to see mto oea gero rto let myinfo rman tkn owo rgu ess to om uch so thank ing him in the usual manner is trolled away
it was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so i did not lose any time
having learned the address of mitchell sons can dyf roma directory atthe berkeley iwas soon atthe iro ffice in sackville street
the gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion
having once told me that the piccadilly house which throughout our interview he called a mansion was sold he considered my business as concluded
when i asked who had purchased it he opened his eyes at hough twi der and paused a few seconds before replying it is sold sir
pardon me is a idw it he qual politeness but i have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it
again he paused longer and raised his eyebrows still more
it is sold sir was again his laconic reply
surely is a id you do not mind letting me know so much
but i do mind he answered
the affairs of the irc lien tsar eab solute lys a feint he hands of mitchell sons can dy
this was manifestly apr igo fthe first water and the rewa sno use arguing with him

he said iwould like to oblige you if i could mr

we once carried out as mall matter of renting some chambers for him when he was the honourable arthur holmwood
if you will let me have his lordship 's address iwill consult the house on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by tonight 's post
it will be a pleasure if we can sofa rdev iat efr omo urr ules as to give the required information to his lordship
iwan ted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so it hank ed him gave the address at dr
seward 's and came away
it was now dark and iwas tired and hungry
i got a cup of tea at the aerated bread company and came down to purfleet by the next train
if ound all the other sat home
min awas looking tired and pale but she made a gallant effort to be bright and cheerful
it wrung my heart to think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her in quietude
thank god this will be the last night of her looking on a tour conference sand feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence
it took all my courage to hold to the wiser esol ution of keeping her out of our grim task
she seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subjects eem sto have become repugnant to her for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders
iam glad we made our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growing knowledge would be torture to her
ico uld not tell the other soft he day 's discovery till we were alone so after dinner followed by alittle music to save appearance seven amongst ourselves it ook minato herroom and left her to go to be d

when i came down again if ound the other sall gathered round the fire in the study
in the train iha dwr it ten my diary sofa rand simply read it off to the mast he best means of letting the mget abreast of my own information
when i had finished van helsing said this has been agreat day 's work friend jonathan

if we find the mall in that house the nour work is near the end
but if the rebe some missing we must search until we find the m

we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr

how are we going to get into that house
we got into the other answered lord god al ming quickly

this burglary business is getting serious
we got off once all right but we have no war are job on hand

this morning when i went to see him after his repulse of van helsing his manner was that of a man command in gde sti ny
he was in fact commanding destiny subject ive ly
he did not really care for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals
it hough ti would improve the occasion and learn something so i asked him what about the flies the set imes
he smiled on me in quite a superior sort of ways uch as mile as would have become the face of malvolio as he answered me the fly my dear sir has one striking feature
it swings are typical of the aerial power soft he psychic faculties
the ancient sdi dwell when the yty pif ie dthe soul as a butterfly
it hough ti would push his analogy to its utmost logically so i said quickly oh it is a soul you are after now is it
his madness foiled his reason and a puzzle dlo ok spread over his face as shaking his head with a decision which i had but seldom seen in him
he said ohno ohno
iwan tno souls
life is all iwan t
here he brightened up
iam pretty indifferent about it at present
life is allright
ihave all iwan t
you must get an ew patient doctor if you wish to study zoo pha gy
this puzzle dme alittle so i drew him on
the ny ouc omm and life

he smiled with an in eff ably benign superiority
ohno
farbe it from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the deity
iam not even concerned in his especially spiritual doing s
if i may state myint elle ctu alpo sition iams of a rasco ncer nst hing spur ely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupied spiritual ly
this was a poser to me
ico uld not at the moment recall enoch 's apposite ness so i had to ask a simple question though i felt that by so doing iwas lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic
and why with enoch
because he walked with god
ico uld not see the analogy but did not like to admit it so i hark ed back to what he had denied
soyo udon ' tca re about life and you do n't want souls
why not
iput my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to disco ncert him
the efforts ucce ed edf or an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old servile manner bent low before mean dac tually fawn edu pon meas here plied

he suddenly stopped and the old cunning looks pre ado ver his face like a winds we epon the surface of the water
and doctor as to life what is it after all
when you 've got all your equi re and you know that you will never want that is all
ihave friends goodfriend slike you dr
seward
this was said with a leer of inexpressible cunning
iknow that is hall never lack the means of life
it hink that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me for heaton cef ell back on the last refuge of such as head ogg eds ile nce
after a short time is a wth a tfor the present it was useless to speak to him
he was sulky and so i came away
later in the day he sent for me
ordinarily iwould not have come with out special reason but just a tpr ese ntia mso interested in him that iwould gladly make an effort
besides iam glad to have anything to help pass the time
harker is out following up clues and so are lord god al ming and quincey
van helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the harker s
he seems to think that byacc urate knowledge of all details hew ill light upon some clue
he does not wish to be disturbed in the work with out cause
iwould have taken him with me to see the patient only it hough tth at after his last repulse he might not care to go again
the rewa sals oan other reason
renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i were alone
if ound him sitting in the middle of the floor on his stool apos ewh ichi sge nera lly indicative of some mental energy on his part
when i came in hesa ida to ncea sth ought he question had been waiting on his lips
what about souls
it was evident the nth at my surmise had been correct
unconscious cereb ratio nwa sdo in gits work even with the lunatic
ide termined to have the matter out
what about the myo urself
ias ked
he did not reply for a moment but looked all around him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer
id on ' twa nta nys oul s
he said in a feeble apologetic way
the matter seemed preying on his mind and so i determined to use it to be cruel only to be kind
so i said you like life and you want life
oh yes
but that is allright
you need n't worry about that
but i asked how are we toget the life without getting the soul also
this seemed to puzzle him so if oll owed it up an ice time you 'll have some time when you 're flying out here with the soul soft hous and so ffl ies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and moaning all around you
you 've got the irl ives you know and you must put up with the irs oul s
something seemed to affect his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes screwing the mup tightly just as a small boy does when his face is being so ape d
the rewa sso meth in gpa the tic in it that touched me
it also gave me a lesson for its eem edt hat before me was a child only a child thought he features were worn and the stubble on the jaws was white
it was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance and knowing how his past moods had interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself it hough ti would enter into his mind as well as i could and go with him
the first step was to restore confidence so i asked him speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his close dear sw ould you like some sugar to get your flies around again
he seemed to wake up all at once and shook his head
with a laugh here plied not much
flies are poor thing saft eral l
after a pause head de dbu tid on ' twa ntt heirs oul sbu zz inground meal lthe same
or spiders
i went on
blow spiders
what 's the use of spiders
the reis n't anything in the mtoe at or
he stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbidden to pic
so so
it hough tto myself this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word ' drink '
what does it mean
renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse for he hurried on a sth ought odis tract myatt ent ion from it id on ' tta kean yst ock at all in such matters
' rats and mice and such small deer ' as shakespeare has it ' chicken feed of the larder ' the ym ight be called
i 'm past all that sort of nonsense
you might aswell as kaman to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks as to try to interest me about the less carnivora when i know of what is before me
is eei said
you want big things that you can make your teeth meet in
how would you like to breakfast on an elephant
what ridiculous nonsense you are talking
he was getting to owi de awake so it hough ti would press him hard
iwon der is a idref lective ly what an elephant 's soul is like
the effect ides ired was obtained for heaton cef ell from his high horse and became a child again
id on ' twa nta nel epha nt 's soul or any soul at all
he said
for a few moments he sat despondent ly
suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement
to hell with you and your soul s
he shouted
why do you plague me about souls
have n't igo ten ought owo rr yand paint odis tract meal ready without thinking of souls
he looked so hostile that it hough the was info ran other homicidal fits oi blew my whistle
the instant however that i did so he became calman dsa ida polo get ically for give me doctor

he had evidently self control so when the attendant scam eit old them not to mind and the yw it hdr ew
renfield watched the mgo
when the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness dr
seward you have been very considerate to ward sme
believe me that i am very very grateful to you
it hough tit well to leave him in this mood and so i came away
the reis certainly something to ponder over in this man 's state
several points see mtom a kew hat the american interview erc all sast or yi fone could only get the min proper order
here they are will not mention drinking
fears the thought of being burdened with the soul of anything
has no dread of wanting life in the future
despises the mean erf or mso fl if eal together though he dreads being haunted by the irs oul s
logically all the set hing spo into new ay
he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life
he dreads the consequence the burden of a soul
the niti sahu man life he looks to
and the assurance
merciful god
the count has been to him and the reiss omen ews chem eof terror afoot
later
i went after my round to van helsing and told him my suspicion
hegre wve ry grave and after thinking the matter over for awhile asked me to take him to renfield
id id so
as we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gail yash eu sed to do in the time which now seems so long ago
when we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old
the flies lethargic with the autumn were beginning to buzzin to the room
we tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend
he went on with his singing just as though we had not been present
he had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into an ote book
we had to come away as ignorant as we went in
his is a curious case indeed
we must watch him to night

ipl ace damani nthe corridor lastnight and told him to make an accurate not eof any sound hemi ght hear from renfield 's room and gave him instructions that if the res hould bean yth in gst range he was to call me
after dinner when we had all gathered round the fire in the study mrs
harker having gone to be dwe discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day
harker was the only one who had any result and wear ein great hopes that his clue maybe an important one
before going to be diw entro und to the patient 's room and looked in through the observation trap
he was sleeping soundly his heart rose and fell with regular respiration
this morning the man on duty reported to me that alittle after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat loudly
ias ked him if that was all
here plied that it was all hehe ard
the rewa sso meth in gabo uth is manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if he had been asleep
he denied sleep but admitted to having dozed for awhile
it is to oba dth at me nca nno tbe trusted unless the yare watched
today harker is out following up his clue and art and quincey are looking after horses
godalming think sth at it will be well to have horses always in readiness for when we get the information which we see kthe re will be not imet olo se
we must sterilize all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset
we shall thus catch the count at his weakest and without are fuge to fly to
van helsing is off to the british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine
the old physicians to oka cco unto ft hing sw hich the irf oll ower sdo not accept and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us later
iso met imes think we must be all madan dth at wes hall wake to sanity in strait waistcoats
later
wehave meta gain
we see mat last to be on the track and our work of tomorrow maybe the beginning of the end
iwon der if renfield 's quiet has anything to do with this
his moods have so followed the doings of the count that the coming destruction of the monster maybe carried to him some subtle way
if we could only gets ome hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument with him to day and his resumption of fly catching it might afford usa valuable clue
he is now seemingly quiet for aspell
is he
that wild yells eem edt oco me from his room
the attendant came bursting into my room and told me that renfield had some how met with some accident
he had heard him yelland when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood
imus tgo at once
chapter dr
seward 's diary october
let me put down with exactness all that happened aswell as i can remember since last imad ean entry
not a detail that i can recall must be forgotten
in all calmness imus tpr oce ed
when i came to renfield 's room if ound him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood
when i went to move him it became a ton ceap parent that he had received some terrible injuries
the res eem edn one of the unit yof purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity
as the face was exposed ico uld see that it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against the floor
indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated
the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over it hinks ir his back is broken
see both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralysed
how such a thing could have happened puzzle dthe attendant beyond measure
he seemed quite bewildered and his brows were gathered in ashes aid ican ' tunde rst and the two things
he could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor
is a way oung woman doit once a tthe ever sfi elda sylum before anyone could lay hands on her
and is up pose he might have broken his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkward kink
but for the life of me ican ' tim agin ehow the two things occurred
if his back was broke he could n't beat his head and if his face was like that before the fallout of bed there would be marks of it
is a idt ohim goto dr
van helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once
iwan thi mwi thou tan instant 's delay
the man ran off and within a few minutes the professor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared
when he saw renfield on the ground helo ok ed keenly at him a moment and the ntu rne dto me
it hink here cogni zed myth ought in my eyes for he said very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendant aha sad accident
he will need very careful watch in gand much attention
is hall stay with you myself but is hall first dress myself
if you will remain isha lli naf ewm in utes join you
the patient was now breathing ster to rous lya ndi twas easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury
van helsing returned with extraordinary celerity bearing with him as urg ical case
he had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before he looked at the patient he whispered to me send the attendant away
we must be alone with him when he becomes conscious after the operation
is a idi think that will do now simmons
wehave done all that we can at present
you had better go your round and dr
van helsing will operate
let me know instantly if the rebe anything unusual anywhere
the man with drew and we went into a strict examination of the patient
the wounds of the face were superficial
the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area
the professor thought am omen tan dsa id we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as far as can be
the rapidity of the suff us ions how sthe terrible nature of his injury
the whole motor areas eem saff ected
the suff us ion of the brain will increase quickly so we must tre phine at once or it may be too late
as he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door
i went over and opened it and found in the corridor with out arthur and quincey in pajamas and slippers the former spoke ihe ard your man call up dr
van helsing and tell him of an accident
so i woke quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep
things are moving to oq uic kl yand to ostra nge lyf or sounds lee pfor any of us the set imes
i've been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as the yha veb een
we 'll have to look back and forward alittle more than we have done
may we come in
in odd edan dhe ldt he door open till the yha dente red then i closed it again
when quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient and not edt he horrible pool on the floor he said softly my god
what has happened to him
poor poor devil
it old him briefly and added that we expect edhe would recover consciousness after the operation for a short time at all events
he went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed with godalming beside him
we all watched in patience
we shall wait said van helsing just long enough to fix the best spot for tre phi ning so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for it is evident that the haemorrhage is increasing
the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness
i had a horrible sinking in my heart and from van helsing 's face iga the red that he felt some fear or apprehension as to what was to come
id read edt he words renfield might speak
iwas positive lya fraid to think
but the conviction of what was coming was on me as ihave read of men who have heard the death watch
the poor man 's breathing came in uncertain gasps
each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak but the nwo uld follow apr olo nge dst ert or ous breath and he would relapse into a more fixed insensibility
in ured as i was to sick beds and death this suspense grew and grew up on me
ico uld almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer
the silence finally became a go nizing
ilo ok eda tm ycomp anions one after another and saw from the irf lush edfa cesa nd damp brows that the yw eree nd uring equal to rt ure
the rewa san erv ous suspense over usa lla sth ough overhead some dread bell would peal out powerful ly when we should least expect it
atlas tthe re came at ime when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast
he might die at any moment
ilo ok edu pat the professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine
his face was sternly set as he spoke the reis not imet olo se
his words maybe worth many lives
ihave been thinking so as is to odh ere
it may be the reis as oul at stake
we shall operate just above the ear
without another word he made the operation
for a few moments the breathing continued to be ster to rous
the nth erec am eab re ath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest
suddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless star e
this was continued for a few moments the nit was softened in to a glad surprise and from his lips came as i gho fre lie f
he moved convulsively and as he did so said i'll be quiet doctor
tell them to take off the strait waistcoat
ihave had a terrible dream and it has left me so we akt hat icann otm ove
what 's wrong with my face
it feels all swollen and its mart sdr ead fully
he tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glass yaga in so i gently put it back
the nva nh elsi ngs aid in a quiet grave to net ell us your dream mr
renfield
as he heard the voice his face brightened through its mutilation and he said that is dr
van helsing
how good it is of you to be here
give me some water my lips are dry and is hall try to tell you
id reamed
he stopped and seemed fainting
ical led quietly to quincey the brand yit is in my study quick
he flew and return ed with a glass the decanter of brandy and acar a feof water
we moistened the parched lips and the patient quickly revived
it seemed however that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quite conscious he looked at me piercing ly with an agonized confusion which is hall never forget and said imus tno tdec eiv em ys elf
it was no dream but all agri mr eal it y
the nhis eyes rove dro und the room
as the yca ugh tsig hto fthe two figures sitting patient lyon the edge of the bed he went on ifiw eren otsu real ready iwould know from the m
for an instant his eyes closed not with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he were bringing all his faculties to be a r
when he opened the mhe said hurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayed quick doctor quick iam dying
if eel that ihave but a few minutes and the nim us tgo back to death or worse
we tm yli psw it hbr and yaga in
ihave something that i must say before i die
or before my poor crushed brain dies anyhow
thankyou
it was that night after you left me when i implore dyo uto let me go away
ico uld n't speak the nfor if elt my tongue was tied
but i was a ssa net he nex cept in that way as i am now
iwas in an agony of despair for along time after you left me its eem ed hours
the nth erec am eas ud den peace to me
my brain seemed to become cool again and ire alized where i was
i heard the dogs bark behind our house but not where he was
ashes poke van helsing 's eyes never blinked but his hand came out and met mine and gripped it hard
he did not however betray him self
he nodded slightly and said goon in a low voice
renfield proceeded
he came up to the window in the mist as i had seen him often before but he was solid then not a ghost and his eyes were fierce like a man 's when angry
he was laughing with his red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees to where the dogs were barking
iwould n't ask him to come in a tfi rst though i knew he wanted to just as he had wanted all along
the nhe began promising meth in gsn oti nwo rds but by doing the m
he was interrupted by a word from the professor how
by making the mha ppe n
just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining
great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on the irwin gs
and big moths in the night with skull and crossbones on the irb acks
van helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously the acheron tiaa tropos of the sph in ges what you call the 'd eat h' she adm oth '
the patient went on without stopping the nhe began to whisper
' rats rats rats
hundreds thousands million soft heman devery one alife
and dogs to eat the man dca tst oo
all live s
all red blood with years of life in it and not merely buzzing flies
' il aug he dat him for iwan ted to see what he could do
the nth edo gsh owl edaw a ybe yond the dark trees in his house
he beckoned me to the window
i got up and looked out and her aise dhis hands and seemed to call out without using any words
ada rkm as ssp read over the grass coming on like the shape of aflame of fire
and the nhe moved the mist to the right and left and i could see that the re were thousands of rats with the ire yes blazing red like his only smaller
hehe ldu phish and andthe yall stopped and it hough the seemed to be saying ' all the sel ives will igiv eyo ua yand many more and greater through countless ages ifyou will fall down and worship me
' and the nar edc loud like the colour of blood seemed to close over my eyes and before i knew what i was doing if ound myself opening the sasha nds ayin gto him ' come in lord and master
' the rats were all gone but he slid into the room through the sash though it was only open an inch wide just as the moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and splendour
his voice was weaker so i moistened his lips with the brand yaga in and he continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced
iwasa bout to call him back to the point but van helsing whispered to me let him go on
don oti nter rupt him
he can not goback and maybe could not proceed at all if once he lost the thread of his thought
he proceeded all day iwai ted to hear from him but he did not send me anything note vena blowfly and when the moon got up iwas pretty angry with him
when he did slide in through the window though it was shut and did not even knock igo tma dwi th him
he sneered at mean dhis white face looked out of the mist with his redeye sgl eam in gand he went on a sth ough he owned the whole place and iwas noone
he did n't even smell the same as he went by me
ico uld n't hold him
it hough tth at some how mrs
harker had come into the room
the two men sitting on the beds to odu pan dcam eo vers tandi ngb ehi nd him so that he could not see the mbu twh ere the yc ould hear better
the yw ere both silent but the professor started and quivered
his face however grew grimmer and sterner still
renfield went on without noticing when mrs
harker came into seemeth is afternoon she was n't the same
it was like tea after the teapot has been watered
here we all moved but noone said a word
he went on idi dn ' tkn owt hats he was here till she spoke and she did n't look the same
id on ' tca ref or the pale people
ilike the mwi th lots of blood in the man dhe rsa lls eem edt oh ave runout
id id n't think of it at the time but when she went away ibe gant oth in kandi tma dem emad to know that he had been taking the life out of her
ico uld feel that the rest quivered as i did but were maine doth erwise still
so when he came to night iwas ready for him
is a wthe mists teal in gina ndi grabbed it tight
i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength
and as i knew i was a madman at times anyhow ires olv edt ouse mypower
ayan dhe felt it to ofor he had to come out of the mist to struggle with me
i held tight and it hough ti was going to win for idi dn ' tme an him to take anymore of her life tillis a whi se yes
the yb urn edin to mean dmy strength became like water
he slipped through it and when it ried to cling to him her aise dme up and flung med own
the rewa sare dc loud before mean dan oise like thunder and the mists eem edt ost eal away under the door
his voice was becoming fainter and his breath more ster to rous
van helsing stood up instinctively
we know the worst now he said
he is here and we know his purpose
it may not be too late
let us bear me dthe same as we were the other night but lose not imet here is not an instant to spare
the rewa sno need to put our fear nay our conviction in to words we shared the mincom mon
we all hurried and took from our rooms the same thing sth at we had when we entered the count 's house
the professor had his read yand as we met in the corridor he pointed to the msi gni fica ntl yash esa id they never leave me and the ys hall not till this unhappy business is over
be wise also my friends
it is no common enemy that we deal with a las
alas
that dear madam minas hould suffer
he stopped his voice was breaking and i do not know if rage or terror predominated in my own heart
outside the harker s 'd oor we paused
art and quincey held back and the latter said should we disturb her
we must said van helsing grimly
if the door be locked is hall break it in
may it not frighten her terribly
it is unusual to break into a lady 's room
van helsing said solemnly you are always right
but this is life and death
all chambers are alike to the doctor
and even were the ynot the yare all as one to me tonight
friend john when it urn the handle ifthe door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you to omy friends
now
he turned the handle ashes poke but the door did not yield
we threw ourselves against it
with a crash it burst open and we almost fell head long into the room
the professor did actually fall and is a wac ross him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees
what is a wap palle dme
if elt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck and my heart seemed to standstill
the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see
onthe be dbes ide the window lay jonathan harker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor
kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outward swa sthe white clad figure of his wife
by her side stood at all thin man clad in black
his face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognized the count in every way event othe scar on his forehead
with his left hand hehe ldb oth mrs
harker 's hands keeping the mawa yw it hhe rar msa tfu llt en sion
his right hand grip ped her bythe back of the neck for cing her face down on his bosom
her white nightdress was smeared with blood and at hin stream trickled down the man 's bare chest which was shown by his torn open dress
the attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten 's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink
as we burst into the room the count turned his face and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap into it
his eyes flame dred with devilish passion
the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth clamped to get her like those of a wild beast
with a wrench which threw his victim backup on the bed as though hurled from a height he turned and sprang at us
but by this time the professor had gained his feet and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred wafer
the count suddenly stopped just as poor lucy had done outside the tomb and cowered back
further and further back heco were das we lifting our crucifixes advanced
the moonlight suddenly failed as a great black clouds ailed across the sky
and when the gaslight sprang up under quincey 's match we saw nothing but a faint vapour
this as we looked trailed under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open had swung back to its old position
van helsing art and imo ved forward to mrs
harker who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given as creams owi lds oea rpi erc in gso despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ears till my dying day
for a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray
her face was ghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin
from her throat trickled at hin stream of blood
here yes were mad with terror
the nsh epu tbe for eher face her poor crushed hands which bore on the ir whiteness the red mark of the count 's terrible grip and from behind the mca meal owd esol at ewa il which made the terrible screams eem only the quick expression of an endless grief
van helsing stepped forward and drew the cover let gently over her body whilst art after looking at her face for an instant despairingly ran out of the room
van helsing whispered to me jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce
we can do not hing with poor madam min afora few moments till she recovers herself
imus twa kehi m
he dipped the end of a towel in coldwater and with it began to flick him on the face his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heartbreaking to hear
ira is edt he blind and looked out of the window
the rewa smu chm oon shine and as i looked ico uld see quincey morris run across the law nand hide himself in the shadow of agreat yew tree
it puzzle dme to think why he was doing this
but at the instant ihe ard harker 's quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness and turned to the bed
on his face as the remi ght well be was a look of wild amazement
he seemed dazed for a few seconds and the nfu llc on scious ness seemed to burst upon him all at once and he started up
his wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned to him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him
instantly however she drew the mina gain and putting her elbows together held her hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook
in god 's name what does this mean
harker cried out
dr
seward dr
van helsing what is it
what has happened
what is wrong
min adea rw hat is it
what does that blood mean
my god my god
has it come to this
and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildly together
good god help us
help her
oh help her
with a quick movement he jumped from bed and began to pull on his clothes all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion
what has happened
tell me all about it
he cried with out pausing
dr
van helsing you love min aik now
oh do something to save her
it can not have gone to ofa rye t
guard her while i look for him
his wife through her terror and horror and distress saws ome sure danger to him
instantly forgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried out
no
no
jonathan you must not leave me
ihave suffered enough to night god knows without the dread of his harming you
you must stay with me
stay with the sef rien dsw how ill watch over you
here xpress ion became frantic as she spoke
and he yielding to her she pulled him down sitting on the bedside and clung to him fiercely
van helsing and it ried to calm the mbo th
the professor held up his golden crucifix and said with wonderful calmness donot fear my dear
we are here and whilst this is close to you no foul thing can approach
you are safe for tonight and we must be calm and take counsel together
she shuddered and was silent holding down her head on her husband 's breast
when she raised it his white night robe was stained with blood where he rli psh adt ouch edan dwh ere the thin open wound in the neck had sent forth drops
the instant she saw it shed re wba ck with a low wail and whispered amidst choking so bs
uncle an unclean
imus ttouch him or kiss him no more
oh that it should be that it is iw hoa mno whi sw or sten em yand who mhe may have most cause to fear
to this he spoke out resolutely nonsense min a
it is a shame to me to hear such a word
iwould not hear it of you
and is hall not hear it from you
may god judge me by my desert sand punish me with more bitter suffering than event his hour if by any actor will of mine anything ever come between us
he put out his arms and folded her to his breast
and for awhile she lay there sobbing
he looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked damp lya bove his quivering nostrils
his mouth was set as steel
after awhile her sobs became less frequent and more faint and the nhes aid to me speaking with a studied calmness which i felt tried his nervous power to the utmost
and now dr
seward tell me all about it
to owe lli know the broad fact
tell me all that has been
it old him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassive ness but his nostrils twitched and his eyes blazed a sito ldh owt her uth less hands of the count had held his wife in that terrible and horrid position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast
it interested me even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroke dthe ruffled hair
just as i had finished quincey and godalming knocked at the door
the yen tered in obedience to our summons
van helsing looked at me questioning ly
i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of the irc omi ngt odi verti fpos sible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from eachother and from the mse lve s
soon nodding acquiescence to him he asked the mwh at the yha dse enor done
to which lord god al ming answered
ico uld not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms
ilo ok edin the study but though he had been there he had gone
he had however
he stopped suddenly looking at the poor drooping figure on the bed
van helsing said gravely goon friend arthur
we want here nomo recon cea lme nts
our hope now is in knowing all
tell free ly
so art went on heh adbe ent here and though it could only have been for a few seconds he made rare hay of the place
all the manuscript had been burned and the blue flames were flickering amongst the white ashes
the cylinder so fy our phonograph to ower eth row non the fire and the wax had helped the flames
here ii nter rupt ed
thank god there is the other copy in the safe
his face lit for a moment but fell again as he went on
iran downstairs the nbu tco uld seen osi gno fhi m
ilo ok edin to renfield 's room but there was not race there except
again he paused
goons aid harker hoarsely
so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellow is dead
mrs
harker raised her head looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly god 's will be done
ico uld not but feel that art was keeping back something
but as it ook it that it was with a purpose is a idn othing
van helsing turned to morris and asked and you friend quincey have you any tote ll
alittle he answered
it may be much eventually but at present ican ' tsay
it hough tit well to know if possible where the count would go when he left the house
id id not see him but is a waba tris efr omr enfield 's window and flap westward
i expected to see him in some shape goback to carfax but he evidently sought some other lair
he will not be back to night for the sky is reddening in the east and the dawn is close
we must work tomorrow
he said the latter words through his shut teeth
for aspace of perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence and i could fancy that i could hear the sound of our hearts beating
the nva nh elsi ngs aid placing his hand tenderly on mrs
harker 's head and now madam min apo or dear dear madam min at el luse xact ly what happened
god knows that i do not want that you be pained but it is need that we know all
for now more than ever has all work to be done quick and sharp and in deadly earnest
the day is close to us that must end all if it may be so and now is the chance that we may live and learn
the poor dear lady shivered and i could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband close rto her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast
the nsh era is edhe rhead proudly and held out on eha ndt ova nh elsi ng who took it in his and after stooping and kissing it reverently held it fast
the other hand was locked in that of her husband who held his other arm thrown round her protecting ly
after a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts she began
it ook the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for along time it did not act
is eem edt obe come more wakeful and myriad so fh or rib le fancies began to crowd in upon my mind
all of the mco nne cted with death and vampires with blood and pain and trouble
her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly donot fret dear
you must be brave and strong and help me through the horrible task
if you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell ofthis fearful thing at all you would understand how much in eed your help
well is a wim us ttr yto help them edi cinet oit sw or kwi thm yw ill if it was to do mean ygo ods oir esol ute lys et myself to sleep
sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for irem ember no more

but if org et now if you know of this

as i must do something or go mad iwr it eth is diary
it is now six o'clock and wear et ome et inthe study in half an hour and takes ome thing to eat for dr
van helsing and dr
seward are agreed that if we do not eat we can not work our best
our best will be god knows required to day
imus tke epw riting at every chance for ida reno tst opto think
all big and little must go down
perhaps a tthe end the little things may teach us most
the teaching big or little could not have landed min aor mean yw here worse than we are today
however we must trust and hope
poor minato ldm ejus tno wwi tht he tears running down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested
that we must keep on trusting and that god will aid us upto the end
the end
oh my god
what end
to work
to work
when dr
van helsing and dr
seward had come back from seeing poor renfield we went gravely into what was to be done
first dr
seward to ldu sth at when he and dr
van helsing had gone down to the room below the yha dfo und renfield lying on the floor all in a heap
his face was all bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were broken
dr
seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything
he said that he had been sitting down he confessed to half dozing when he heard loud voice sin the room and the nren field had called out loud lys ever alt imes god
god
god
after that the rewa sas ound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor facedown just as the doctor shad seen him
van helsing asked if he had heard voices or a voice and he said he could not say
that at first it had seemed to him as if the re were two but as the rewa sno one in the room it could have been only one
he could swear to it if required that the word god was spoken by the patient
dr
seward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go into the matter
the question of an inquest had to be considered and it would never do to put forward the truth as noone would be lieve it
as it was he thought that onthe attendant 's evidence he could give a certificate of death by misadventure in falling from bed
incase the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result
when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decided was that minas hould be in full confidence
that nothing of any sort no matter how painful should be kept from her
she herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair
the remus tbe no concealment she said
alas
wehave had to om uch already
and besides the reis nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than ihave already endured than is uffe rno w
whatever may happen it must be of new hope or of new courage to me
van helsing was looking at her fixed lya ssh esp ok eand said suddenly but quietly but dear madam min aare you not afraid
not for yourself but for other sfr omy ourself after what has happened
her face grew set in its lines but here yes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered a hno
for my mind is made up
to what
he asked gently whilst we were all very still foreach in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant
her answer came with direct simplicity as though she was simply stating a fact because i fifi ndi nm ys elf and is hall watch keenly for it as i gno fha rmt oan yth at ilove is hall die
you would not kill yourself
he asked hoarsely
iwould
if the re were no friend who loved me who would save me such a pain and so desperate an effort
she looked at him meaning lya ssh esp ok e
he was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head ashes aids ole mn ly
my child there is such an on eif it were for your good
for myself i could hold it in myaccount with god to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it were best
nay were its a fe
but my child
for a moment he seemed choked and agreat so bros ein his throat
he gulped it down and went on the rear eher eso me who would stand between you and death
you must not die
you must not die by any hand but least of all your own
until the other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must not die
for if he is still with the quick undead your death would make you even as he is
no you must live
you must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable
you must fight death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy
by the day or the night in safety or in peril
on your living soul ich arg eyo uth at you do not die
nay north in kof death till this great evil be past
the poor dear grew white as death and shook and shivered as ihave seen a quick sands hakea nds hiver at the incoming of the tide
we were all silent
we could do not hing
at length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweet ly but oh so sorrowfully as she held out her hand ipro mise you my dear friend that if god will let me live is hall strive to do so
till i fit maybe in his good time this horror may have passed away from me
she was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and web egan to discuss what we were to do
it old hertha tsh ewa sto have all the paper sin the safe and all the paper so rd iar ies and phonograph swem ight hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done before
she was pleased with the prospect of anything to do if please dc ould be used in connection with so grim an interest
asus ual van helsing had thought ahead of everyone else and was prepared with an exact order in gof our work
it is perhaps we ll he said that at our meeting after our visit to carfax wed eci de dno tto do anything with the earth boxes that lay there
had wed one so the count must have guessed our purpose and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the other s
but now he does not know our intention s
nay more in all probability he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilize his lair sso that he can not use the maso fold
we are now so much further advanced in our knowledge as to the ird is position that when we have examined the house in piccadilly we may track the very last of the m
today the nisou rsa ndi nit rest sour hope
the sun that rose on our sorrow this morning guards us in its course
until it sets tonight that monster must retain whatever form hen ow has
he is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope
he can not melt into thin air nord is appear through cracks or chinks or crannies
if he got hr ough ado or way he must open the door like a mortal
and so we have this day to hunt out all his lair sands teri liz ethe m
so we shall if we have not yet catch him and destroy him drive him to bay in some place where the catching and the destroying shall be in time sure
here is tarte dup for ico uld not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and second ss opre cious lyla den with mina 's life and happiness were flying from us since whilst we talked action was impossible
but van helsing held up his hand warning ly
nay friend jonathan he said in this the quickest way home is the longest ways oyo urp rover bsa y
we shall all acta nda ctw it hde spera teq uic kwh ent he time has come
but think i nall probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly
the count may have many houses which he has bought
ofthe mhe will have deeds of purchase keys and other things
he will have paper that he write on
he will have his book of cheques
the rear eman ybe longing sth at hem us tha ves ome where
why not in this place so central so quiet where he come and go by the front or the back at all hours when i nthe very vast of the traffic there is none to notice
we shall got here and search that house
and when we learn what it holds the nwe do what our friend arthur call in his phrases of hunt 's top the earth s ' and so we rundown our old fox so
is it not
the nle tusc ome at once i cried wear ewa sting the precious precious time
the professor did not move but simply said and how are we toget into that house in piccadilly
anyway
icri ed
we shall break in ifn eed be
and your police
where will they bean dwh atwill the ysa y
iwas staggered but i knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it
so i said as quietly as i could do n't wait more than need be
you know iams ure what torture iam in
ahm ych il dth at id o
and indeed the reis now is hof met oad dto your anguish
but just think what can we do until all the world beat movement
the nwi llc omeo urt ime
ihave thought and thought and its eem sto meth at the simplest way is the best of all
now we wish to get into the house but we have no key
is it not so
in odd ed
now suppose that you were in truth the owner of that house and could not still get in
and think there was to you no conscience of the house breaker what would you do
is hould get a respectable locksmith and set him to work topic kthe lock for me
and your police the yw ould interfere would they not
ohno
not ifthe yk new them an wasp roper lye mployed
the nhe looked at me as keenly ashes poke all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as to whether or not that employer has a good conscience or abadon e
your police must indeed be zealous menand clever oh so clever in reading the heart that the yt rouble themselves in such matter
non omy friend jonathan you got a ket heloc koff a hundred empty house sin this your london or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are right lydon eand at the time such things are right lydon en oon ewi lli nter fere
ihave read of agent leman who owned as of in eho use in london and when he went for months of summer to switzerland and lockup his house some burglar come and broke window at back and got in
the nhe went and made open the shutter sin front and walkout and in through the door before the very eyes of the police
the nhe have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice
and when the day come he selloff by agreat auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own the m
the nhe goto abu il der and he sell him that house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away with in acer taint ime
and your police and other authority help him all the yca n
and when that owner comeback from his holiday in switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been
this was all done en regle and in our work we shall be enr egle to o
we shall not go so early that the police men who have the nli ttl et oth in kof shall deem it strange
but we shall go after ten o'clock when the rear eman ya bout and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house
ico uld not but see how right he was an dthe terrible despair of mina 's face became relaxed in thought
the rewa shop eins uch good counsel
van helsing went on when once within that house we may find more clues
at any rate some of us can remain the re whilst the rest find the other places where the rebe more earth boxes at bermondsey and mile end
lord god al ming stood up
ican be of some use here he said
is hall wire to my people to have horses and carriage sw here they will be most convenient
look here old fellow said morris it is a capital idea to have allready in case we want to go horseback in gb utd on ' tyo uth in kth at one of your snappy carriage swith its herald icad or nment sin aby way of walworth or mile end would attract to om uch attention for our purpose
it seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south or east
and even leave the mso me where near the neighbourhood wear ego in gto
friend quincey is right
said the professor
his head is what you call in plane with the horizon
it is a difficult thing that we got odo and we do not want nope opl est owa tch us if so it may
minato ok agro wing interest in everything and iwas rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs was helping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night
she was very very pale almost ghastly and so thin that he rli psw ered raw nawa ys how in ghe rte eth in some what of prominence
id id not mention this last lest it should give her needless pain but it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor lucy when the count had sucked her blood
as yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short and the rewa stime for fear
when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and ofthe disposition of our forces there were news ources of doubt
it was finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the count 's lair close at hand
incase he should find it out to oso on wes hould thus best ill ahead of him in our work of destruction
and his presence in his purely materials hap eand at his weakest might give us some new clue
as to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the professor that after our visit to carfax we should all entert he house in piccadilly
that the two doctors and is hould remain the re whilst lord god al ming and quincey found the lair sat walworth and mile end and destroyed the m
it was possible if not likely the professor urged that the count might appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with him the nand the re
at any rate we might be able to follow him in force
to this plan is tren uous lyo bject edan dso far as my going was concerned for isa id that i intended to stay and protect min a
it hough tth at my mind was made upon the subject but min awo uld not listen to myobject ion
she said that the remi ght be some law matter in which i could be useful
that amongst the count 's paper smi ght be some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania
and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the count 's extraordinary power
i had to give inform in a 's resolution was fixed
she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together
as for meshes aid ihave no fear
things have been a sba das the yca nbe
and whatever may happen must have in its ome element of hope or comfort
go my husband
god can i fhe wishes it guard meas well alone as with anyone present
so i started up crying out the ning od 's name let us come at once for wear elo sing time
the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we think
not so
said van helsing holding up his hand
but why
ias ked
do you forget he said with actually a smile that last night he banquet edhe avi lya nd will sleep late
did ifor get
shall ie ver
can i ever
can any of use ver for get that terrible scene
minas tru ggl ed hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain over master edhe rand she put her hands before her face and shuddered whilst she moaned
van helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience
he had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort
when it struck him what he said he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her
oh madam min ah esa id dear dear madam min aal as
that i ofall who sore vere nce you should have said anything so forget ful
the ses tupi do ldl ipso fmi nea ndt his stupid old head donot deserves obu tyo uwi ll for get it will you not
he bent low beside her ashes poke
she took his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely no isha lln otf or get for it is well that i remember
and with it ihave so much in memory of youth at iss we et that it ake it alltogether
now you must all be going soon
breakfast is ready and we must all eat that we may be strong
breakfast was a strange meal to us all
we tried to be cheerful and encourage each other and mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us
when it was over van helsing stood up and said no wm yd ear friends we goforth to our terrible enterprise
are we all armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy 's lair
armed against ghostly aswell as carnal attack
we all assured him
the niti swell
now madam min ayo uar ein any case quite safe here until the sunset
and before the nwe shall return
if
we shall return
but before we go let me see you armed against personal attack
ihave myself since you came down prepared your chamber bythe placing of things of which we know so that he may not enter
now let me guard your self
on your forehead itouch this piece of sacred wafer in the name of the father the son and
the rewa safe arf uls cream which almost froze our hearts to hear
as he had placed the wafer on mina 's forehead it had seared it
had burned into the flesh as though it had been apiece of white hot metal
my poor darling 's brain had to ldh erth esign if i can ceo fthe fact as quickly as he rne rv esr ece ive dthe pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that he rover wrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream
but the words to her thought came quickly
the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when the rec amet here action and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of abasement
pulling her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she wailed out
uncle an

event heal might ys huns my polluted flesh
imus tbe art his mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgement day
the yall paused
i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief and putting my arms around held her tight
for a few minutes our sorrowful heart sbe at together whilst the friends around us turned away the ire yes that ran tears silently
the nva nh elsi ngt urn edan dsa idg ravel y
so grave lyth at ico uld not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself
it may be that you may have to be a rth at mark till god himself see fit as he most surely shall onthe judgement day to redress all wrong soft he earth and of his children that he has placed the reon
and ohm adam min am yd ear my dear may we who love you bet here to see when that reds cart he sign of god 's knowledge of what has been shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know
for so surely as we live that scars hall pass away when god sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us
till the nwe bear our cross as his son did in obedience to his will
it may be that we are chosen instrument so fhi sgo odp leasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that other through stripes and shame
through tears and blood
through doubts and fear and all that makes the difference between god and man
the rewa shop ein his words and comfort
and the yma defor resignation
min aand ibo th felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the old man 's hands and bent over and kissed it
the nwi thou taw or dwe all knelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to eachother
we men pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom each in his own way we love d
and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us
it was the nti met osta rt
so i said farewell to mina apart in gwh ich neither of us shall forget to our dying day and we set out
to one thing i have made up my mind
if we find out that min amust be a vampire in the end the nsh esha lln otg oint otha tun known and terrible land alone
is up pose it is thus that in oldtime soneva mpi re meant many
just as the ir hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for the irg has tly ranks
we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as onthe first occasion
it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surrounding so fn egle ctan ddu stand decay the rewa san yg round for such fear as already we knew
had not our minds been made up and had the reno tbe enter rib leme mori estos purus on we could hardly have proceeded with our task
we found no papers or any sign of use in the house
and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen the mlas t
dr
van helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before him and now my friends wehave adut yhe re todo
we must sterilize this earth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from afar distant land for such fell use
he has chosen this earth because it has been holy
thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it more holy still
it was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to go d
ashes poke he took from his bag as crew driver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the case swa sth row nope n
the earth smelled must yand close but we did not somehow see mtom in dfor our attention was concentrated on the professor
taking from his box apiece of the sacred wafer he laid it reverently on the earth and the nsh utting down the lid began to screw it home we aiding him as he worked
one by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes and left the mas we had found the mto all appearance
but in each was a portion of the host
when we closed the door behind us the professor said solemnly so much is already done
it may be that with all the other swe can be so successful then the sunset of this evening may shine of madam min a 's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain
as we passed across the law no no urw ayto the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum

i waved my hand to her and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished
she nodded in reply to show that she understood
the last is a wsh ewa swa ving her hand in farewell
it was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train which was steaming in a swer each edt he platform
ihave written this inthe train
piccadilly o'clock
just before we reached fenchurch street lord god al ming said to me quincey and iwill find a locksmith
you had better not come with us incase the res hould bean ydi ffi cult y
for under the circumstances it would n't seems oba dfor us to break into an empty house
but you are as oli cito rand the incorporated law society might tell you that you should have known better
idem urr edas to my not sharing any danger even of odium but he went on besides it will attract less attention if the rear en otto oman yof us
my title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along
you had better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park
somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away do you all come across
we shall be on the lookout for you and shall let you in
the advice is good
said van helsing so we said no more
godalming and morris hurried off in a cab we following in another
atthe corner of arlington street our contingent goto utan dst rolled into the green park
my heart beat as is a wthe house on which so much of our hope was centre dlo omi ngu pgr iman dsi lentini tsd ese rted condition amongst its more lively and spruce looking neighbours
we sat down on a bench with in good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract a slit tle attention as possible
the minutes seemed to pass with lead en feet as we waited for the coming of the other s
at length we saw a four wheeler drive up
out of it in leisurely fashion got lord god al ming and morris
and down from the box descended at hicks etwork in gman with his rush woven basket of tools
morris paid the cab man who touched his hat and drove away
together the two ascended the steps and lord god al ming pointed out what he wanted done
the work man took off his coat leisure lya nd hung it on one of the spikes of the rails ayin gso meth in gto apo lice man who just the nsa unter eda long
the police man nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling down place dhis bag beside him

all at once the door opened under a slight push from him and he and the two other sent ered the hall
we sat still
my own cigar burnt furiously but van helsing 's went cold altogether
we waited patiently as we saw the work man come out and bring his bag
the nhe held the door partly open steadying it with his knees whilst he fitted a key to the lock
this he finally handed to lord god al mingw hot ook out his purse and gave him something
the man touched his hat to ok his bag put on his coat and departed
not as oul to okt he slightest notice of the whole transaction
when the man had fairly gone wet hree crossed the street and knocked at the door
it was immediately opened by quincey morris beside who mst ood lord god al ming lighting aci gar
the place smells so vile lys a idt he latter as we came in
it did indeed smell vile ly like the old chapel at carfax and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the place pretty freely
we moved to explore the house all keeping together in case of attack for we knew we had a strong and wily enemy to deal with an das yet we did not know whether the count might not be in the house
in the dining room which lay at the back of the hall we found eight boxes of earth
eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought
our work was not over and would never be until we should have found the missing box
first we opened the shutter soft he window which looked out across an arrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of asta ble pointed to look like the front of amini at ure house
the re were now in dows in its owe were not afraid of being overlooked
we did not lose any time in examining the chest s
with the tools which we had brought with us we opened the mone by one and treated them as we had treated those other sin the old chapel
it was evident to us that the count was not at present in the house and we proceeded to search for any of his effects
after a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from basement to attic we came to the conclusion that the dining room contained any effect sw hich might be long to the count
and so we proceeded to minutely examine the m
the yl ayin as orto for der lyd is order on the great dining room table
the re were title deeds of the piccadilly house in agreat bundled eeds of the purchase of the house sat mile end and bermondsey notepaper envelopes and pens and in k
all were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep the mfr omt he dust
the re were also a clothes brush abr us hand com band ajuga ndb asin
the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as if with blood
last of all was alittle heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging to the other houses
when we had examined this last find lord god al ming and quincey morris taking accurate notes of the various addresses of the house sin the east and the south took with the mthe keys in agreat bunch and set out to destroy the boxes in the sep laces
the rest of us are with what patience we can waiting their return or the coming of the count
chapter dr
seward 's diary october
the time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of godalming and quincey morris
the professor tried to keep our minds active by using the mall the time
ico uld see his beneficent purpose by the side glance sw hich he threw from time to time at harker
the poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see
last night he was a frank happy looking man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair
today he is a drawn haggard oldman whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief written lines of his face
his energy is still intact
infact he is like a living flame
this may yet be his salvation for ifa llg owe lli twill tide him over the despairing period
he will then in a kind of way wake again to the realities of life
poor fellow it hough tm yow ntr ou blew a sba den ough but his
the professor know sth is well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active
what he has been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest
sowell as i can remember her eit is ihave studied over and over again since the yca mein to my hands all the paper sre latin gto this monster and the more ihave studied the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out
all through the rear esign so fhi sad vance
not only of his power but of his knowledge of it
as i learned from the research eso fm yf rien dar mini us of budapest hhe was in life amos two nder ful man
soldiers tates man and alchemist which latter was the highest development of the science knowledge of his time
he had a mighty brain alea rning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse
he dared event oatt end the scholomance and the rewa snob rancho fk now ledge of his time that he did not essay
well in him the brainpower ssu rv ive dthe physical death
though it would seem that memory was not all complete
in some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child
but he is growing and something sth at were childish at the first are now of man 's stature
heise xp erim ent in gand doing it well
and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet he may be yet if we fail the father or further ero fan ewo rder of being sw hose road must lead through death not life
harker groaned and said and this is all array eda gains tm yd arling
but how is he experimenting
the knowledge may help us to defeat him
he has all along since his coming been trying his powers low ly but surely
that big child brain of his is working
well for us itis as yet ach ildb rain
for had he dared at the first to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power
however he means to succeed and aman who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow
festina lente may well be his motto
if a il to understand said harker wearily
oh do be more plain to me
perhaps grief and trouble are dulling my brain
the professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke a hm ych il di will be plain
do you not see how of late this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimental ly
how he has been making use of the zoo pha go us patient to effect his entry into friend john 's home
for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will must atthe first make entry only when asked the reto by an inmate
but the sea reno this most important experiments
do we not see how atthe first all the ses ogre at boxes were moved by others
he knew not the nbu tth at must be so
but all the time that so great child brain of his was growing and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box
so he began to help
and the nw he nh efo und that this beall right het ryt omo vet he mall alone
and so he progress and he scatter the segrave so fhi m
and none but he know where the yare hidden
he may have intend to bury the mde epi nthe ground
so that only he use the mint henig hto rats uch time as he can change his form the yd ohim equal well and none may know the sea re his hiding place
but my child donot despair this knowledge came to him just too late
already a llo fhi sla irs but one best eri liz eas for him
and before the sunset this shall be so
the nhe have no place where he can move and hide
ide layed this morning that so we might be sure
isthe reno tmo re ats take for us than for him
the nw hyn o tbe more careful than him
by my clock it is one hour and already if all be well friend arthur and quincey are on the ir way to us
today is our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance
see
the rear efi veo fus when those absent on esr et urn
whilst we were speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door the double post man 's knock ofthe telegraph boy
we all moved out to the hall with one impulse and van helsing holding up his hand to us to keep silence stepped to the door and opened it
the boy handed in a dispatch
the professor closed the door again and after looking at the direction opened it and read aloud
lookout for d
he has just now come from carfax hurriedly and hastened to ward sthe south
he seems to be going the round and may want to see you min a
the rewa sapa use broken by jonathan harker 's voice now god bethan ked we shall soon meet
van helsing turned to him quickly and said god will act in his own way and time
don otf ear and do not rejoice as yet
for what we wish for a tthe moment maybe our own undoing s
icar efor nothing now he answered hot lye xc ept to wipeout this brute from the face of creation
iwould sell my soul to do it
oh hush hush my child
said van helsing
god does not purchase souls in this wise and the devil though he may purchase does not keep faith
but god is merciful and just and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear madam min a
think you how he rpa in would be doubled did she but he ary our wild words
don otf ear any of us wear eal lde voted to this cause and today shall see the end
the time is coming for action
today this vampire is limit to the power so fma nand till sunset he may not change
it will take him time to arrive here see it is twenty minutes past one and the rear eye tso met imes before he can hither come behe never so quick
what we must hope for is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first
about half an hour after we had received mrs
harker 's telegram the rec am ea quiet resolute knock at the hall door
it was just an ordinary knocks uch as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it made the professor 's heart and mine beat loudly
we looked at eachother and together moved out into the hall
we each held ready to use our various armaments the spiritual inthe lefthand the mortal in the right
van helsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stood back having both hands ready for action
the gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when onthe step close to the door we saw lord god al ming and quincey morris
the yca me quickly in and closed the door behind the mthe former saying as the ym ove dal on gthe hall it is allright
we found both places
six boxes in each and we destroyed the mall
destroyed
asked the professor
for him
we were silent for a minute and the nq uin ce ysa id there 's nothing to do but to wait here
if however he does n't turn up by five o'clock we must start of f
for it won ' tdot olea vem rs
harker alone after sunset
he will be here before long now said van helsing who had been consulting his pocket book
not a bene in madam 's telegram he went south from carfax
that means he went to cross the river and he could only do so at slac kof tide which should be something before one o'clock
that he went south has a meaning for us
he is a sye to nly suspicious and he went from carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least
you must have been at bermondsey only as hort time before him
that he is not here already shows that he went to mile end next
this took him sometime for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way
believe me my friends we shall not have long to wait now
we should have read yso me plan of attacks otha twe may throwaway noch an ce
hush the reis not ime now
have all your arms
berea dy
hehe ldu pawar ning hand ashes poke for weal lco uld hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door
ico uld not but admire even at such a moment the way in which adom in an tsp irit asserted itself
in all our hunting parties and adventure sind if ferent parts of the world quincey morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i had been accustomed to obey him implicitly
now the old habits eem edt ober ene wed instinctively
with a swift glance around the room heaton cela id out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with a gesture place du seach in position
van helsing harker and i were just behind the doors otha twh en itwas opened the professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the income rand the door
godalming behind and quincey infront stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window
we waited in a suspense that made the second spass with nightmares low ness
the slow careful steps came along the hall
the count was evidently prepared for some surprise atleast he feared it
suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room
winning away past usb efore any of us could raise a hand to stay him
the rewa sso meth in gso panther like in the movement something so unh uman that it seemed to sober usa ll from the shock of his coming
the first to act was harker who with a quick movement threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house
as the count saw usa horrible sort of snarl passed over his face showing the eye teeth long and pointed
but the evils mile as quickly passed into a cold star eof lion like disdain
his expression again changed as with a single impulse we all advanced upon him
it was a pity that we had not some better organized plan of attack for even at the moment i wondered what we were to do
id id not myself know whether our lethal weapon sw ould avail usa nyt hing
harker evidently meant to try the matter for he had read yh is great kuk rik nife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him
the blow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the count 's leap back save dhi m
as econ dles sand the trenchant blade had shorn through his heart
as it was the point just cut the cloth of his coat making a wide gap when cea bundle of banknotes and astream of gold fell out
the expression of the count 's face was so hellish that for a moment if eared for harker though i saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke
instinctively imo ved forward with a protective impulse holding the crucifix and wafer in my left hand
if elta might ypo we rfl ya long my armand it was without surprise that is a wthe monster cower back before as i mila rmo vem ent made spontaneously by each one of us
it would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity of anger and hellish rage which came over the count 's face
his waxen hue became greenish yellow bythe contrast of his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating wound
the next instant with a sinuous dive he swept under harker 's arm ere his blow could fall and grasping a handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threw himself at the window
amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass he tumbled into the flagged are abel ow
through the sound of the shivering glass ico uld heart he ting of the gold ass omeo fthe sovereign sfe llo nthe flagging
we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground
her us hing up the steps crossed the flagged yard and pushed open the stable door
the re he turned and spoke to us
you think to baffle me you with your paleface salli naro wli kesh eep in a butcher 's
you shall be sorry yet each one of you
you think you have left me without a place to rest but i have more
my revenge is just begun
is pre adit over centuries and time is on my side
your girls that you all love are mine already
and through the myo uand other ssh all yet be mine my creatures to do my bidding and to be my jackals when i want to feed
bah
with a contemptuous sneer hepa ssed quickly through the door and we heard the rusty bolt creak as he fastened it behind him
ado or beyond opened and shut
the first of us to speak was the professor
realizing the difficulty of following him through the stable we moved to ward the hall
wehave learn tso meth in g
much
notwithstanding his brave words he fears us
he fears time he fears want
for if not why he hurry so
his very tone betray him or my ears deceive
why take that money
you follow quick
you are hunter soft he wild beast and understand it so
for me imake sure that nothing here maybe of use to him if so that he returns
ashes poke he put the money remaining in his pocket took the title deeds in the bundle as harker had left the man dsw ept the remaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to the mwi tham at ch
godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard and harker had lowered himself from the window to follow the count
he had however bolted the stable door and bythe time they had forced it open the rewa sno sign of him
van helsing and it ried to make inquiry at the back of the house
but the mews was deserted and noone had seen him depart
it was now late in the afternoon and sunset was not far off
we had to recognize that our game was up
with heavy heart swe agreed with the professor when he said let us goback to madam min a
poor poor dear madam min a
all we can do just now is done and we can there atleast protect her
but we need not despair
the reis but one more earth box and we must try to find it
when that is done all may yet be well
ico uld see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort harker
the poor fellow was quite broken down now and again he gave a low groan which he could not suppress
he was thinking of his wife
with sad heart swe came back to my house where we found mrs
harker waiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness
when she saw our faces her own became a spa leas death
for a second or two here yes were closed as if she were in secret prayer
and the nsh esa idc he erful lyic anne vert hanky oua lleno ugh
oh my poor darling
as she spoke she took her husband 's greyhead in her hands and kissed it
lay your poor head here and rest it
all will yet be well dear
god will protect us if he so will it in his good intent
the poor fellow groaned
the rewa sno place for words in his sublime misery
we had a sort of perfunctory supper together and it hink it cheered usa llu pso me what
it was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry people for non eof us had eaten anything since breakfast or the sense of companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all less miserable and saw the morrow as not altogether without hope
true to our promise we told mrs
harker everything which had passed
and although she grew snow yw hit eat times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband and red at other sw he nhis devotion to her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness
when we came to the part where harker had rushed at the count sore ckl essl ys he clung to her husband 's armand held it tight as though he rcl in ging could protect him from any harm that might come
she said nothing however till the narration was all done and matters had been brought up to the present time
the nwi thou tle tting go her husband 's hands he stood up amongst us and spoke
oh that i could give any idea of the scene
of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and animation with the red scar on her forehead of which she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our teeth remembering when cea nd how it came
her lovingkindness against our grim hate
her tender faith against all our fears and doubting
and we know in gth at sofa rass ym bols went she with all her goodness and purity and faith was outcast from god
jonathan she said and the words ound ed like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my true true friends iwan tyo uto bears ome thing in mind through all this dreadful time
iknow that you must fight
that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live here after
but it is not a work of hate
that poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all
just think what will be his joy when he too is destroyed in his worse rpa rtt hath is better part may have spiritual immortality
you must be pitiful to him to otho ugh it may not hold your hands from his destruction
as she spoke ico uld see her husband 's face dark enan ddraw together as though the passion in him were shrivel in ghi sbe in gto its core
instinctively the clasp on his wife 's hand grew closer till his knuckles looked white
she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she must have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever
as she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearing his hand from her sashes poke
may god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at
if beyond it ico uld send his soul forever and ever to burning hell iwould do it
oh hush
oh hush in the name of the good god
don'ts a ysu cht hing sjo nathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror
just think my dear
ihave been thinking all this long long day of it
that
perhaps
someday
it oom a yn eeds uch pity and that some other like you and with equal cause for anger may deny it to me
oh my husband
my husband indeed iwould have spared you such a thought had the rebe enan other way
but i pray that god may not have treasure dyo urw il dword sex cept as the heartbroken wail of avery loving and sorely stricken man
oh god let the sep oor white hair sgo in evidence of what he has suffered who all his life has done now ron gand on whom soma nys or rows have come
we men were all in tears now
the rewa snores is ting the man dwe we ptop en ly
she wept to oto see that he rsw eet erco uns els had prevailed
her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms round her hid his face in the folds of her dress
van helsing beckoned to us and west oleo uto fthe room leaving the two loving heart salon ewi tht heir god
before the yr et ired the professor fixed up the room against any coming of the vampire and assured mrs
harker that she might rest in peace
she tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husband 's sake tried to see mcon tent
it was a brave struggle and was it hink and believe not without its reward
van helsing had placed at hand abell which either of the mwa sto sound in case of any emergency
when the yha dre tired quincey godalming and i arranged that we should sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady
the first watch falls to quincey so there sto fuss hall be off to be dass oona swe can
godalming has already turned in for his isthe second watch
now that my work is done it oos hall goto be d
jonathan harker 's journal october close to midnight
it hough tye ster day would never end
the rewa sover me a year ning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things change dan dth at any change must now be for the better
before we parted wed is cussed what our next step was to be but we could arrive at no result
all we knew was that one earth box remained and that the count alone knew where it was
if he chooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years
and in the meantime the thought i sto oh or rib lei dare not think of it even now
this iknow that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection that one is my poor wrong edda rlin g
ilove dhe ratho usa ndt imes more for her sweet pity of lastnight api ty that made my own hate ofthe monsters eem despicable
surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature
this is hope to me
we are all drifting reef wards now and faith is our only anchor
thank god
