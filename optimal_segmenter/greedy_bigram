although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous if merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various rumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese

my riel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of a ix hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar
it was said that his father destining him to be the heir of his own post had married him at avery early age eighteen or twenty inaccordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families
inspite of this marriage however it was said that charles myriel created a great deal of talk
he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry
the revolution came events succeeded eachother with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed
m
charles myriel emigrated to italy atthe very beginning of the revolution
the rehis wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered
he had no children

the ruin of the french society of the old end ays the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of ' which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed the mfrom adistance with the magnifying powersofterror did the sec auset heideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him
was he inthe midst of the sedis traction sthe sea ffect ions which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blow swhich sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart aman who mpu blicca tastrophes would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune
noone could have to lda llth at was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest
in m
my riel was the cure of bbri gnoll es
he was already advanced in years and lived in avery retired manner
about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his curacy just what is not precisely known to ok him to paris
among other powerful person stow hom he went to solicit a idf or his parishioners was m
lecar dina lfes ch
one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle the worthy cure who was waiting in the anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed
napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this oldman turned round and said abruptly who is this goodman who is staring at me
sire said m
my riel you are looking at a good man and iata great man
each of us can profit by it
that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and sometime after wards m
my riel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of dwhat truth was the rea fter all in the stories which were invented a sto the early portion of m
my riel 's life
noone knew
very few families had been acquainted with the myriel family before the revolution
m
my riel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in alittle to wnw here there are many mouth swhich talk and very few heads which think
he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop
but after all the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only noise saying swords lessthan words palabre sast he energetic language of the south express esi t

the iron lydo mestic was a female servant of the same age as mademoiselle baptist in eand name dma dame magloire who after having been the servant of m
lecure now assume dthe double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur
mademoiselle baptist in ewas along pale thing ent lec reatures here alized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for its eems that awoman must needs beam other inorderto be venerable
she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but as uccess ion of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her as orto fpa lloran dtrans parency and asshead vance din years she had acquired what maybe called the beauty of goodness
what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen
she was a soul rather than a virgin
herpers on seemed made of ashado wthe rewash ardly sufficient body toprovide for sex alittle matter enclosing a light large eyes forever drooping amer epr etext for a soul 's remaining on the earth
madame magloire was alittle fat white oldwoman corpulent and bustling always out of breath in the first place because of her activity and in the next because of her asthma

welcome the episcopal palace of dad join sthe hospital
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m
henri puget doctor of the ology of the faculty of paris abbe of simor ewho had been bishop of din
this palace was a genuine seignorial residence
everything about it had a grand air the apartment soft he bishop the drawing room sthe chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcade sin the old florentine fashion and garden splan ted with magnificent trees
in the dining room along and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the garden sm

the portrait soft he sese ven reverend person ages decorated this apartment and this memorable date the tho fju lywa sthere engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble
the hospital was a low and narrow building of asingle story with a small garden
three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital
the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house
monsieur the director of the hospital said he tohim howmany sick people have you atthe present moment
twenty six monseigneur
that was the number which icount eds aid the bishop
the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other
that is what i observed
the halls are not hing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in the m
so it seems to me
and the nwhen the reis aray of sun the garden is very small for the convalescent s
that was what is a idt omy self
incase of epidemics wehave had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness twoyears ago and a hundred patients at times we know not what to do
that is the thought which occurred to me
what would you have monseigneur
said the director
one must resign on e 's self
this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the ground floor
the bishop remained silent for amoment the nhet urned abruptly to the director of the hospital
monsieur said he howmany beds do you think this hall alone would hold
monseigneur 's diningroom
exclaimed the stupefied director
the bishop cast aglance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes
it would hold full twenty beds said he asthough speaking to himself
the nra is in ghis voice hold monsieur the director of the hospital iwill tell you something
the reise vident lyam is take her e

the rear eth re eof usher eand wehave room for sixty
the reiss ome mistake it elly ou you have myhouse and ihave your s
give me back myhouse you are at home here
onthe following day the thirty six patients were installed in the bishop 's palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital
m
my riel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution
his sister was in receipt of a year lyin come off ive hundred francs which suffice dfor her personal want sat the vicarage

my riel made nochange in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied the see of dasha sbeen seen he called it regulating his household expenses
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptist in e
this holy woman regarded monseigneur of dasa to nean dthe sametime herbrother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church
she simply love dan dve nerated him
when he spoke she bowed when he acted she yielded her adherence
the iron lyser van tma dame magloire grumbled alittle
it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptist in emade fifteen hundred francs ayear
onthese fifteen hundred francs the set wool dwomen and the old man subsisted
and when avilla gecu rate came to dthe bishops till found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptist in e
one day after he had been in dabout three months the bishops aidan dst illiam quite cramped with it all
ishould think so
exclaimed madame magloire
monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage into wnan dfor his journey sabout the diocese
it was customary for bishops in former days
hold
cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire
and he made his demand
sometime after wards the general council took this demand underconsideration and voted him anannual sumo fthr eet housand francs under this heading allowance to m
the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visit s
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and as enator of the empire aformer member of the council of the fivehundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town of dwr ote to m

what is the use of the set rips in the first place
next how can the posting be accomplished in the semo untain ous parts
the rear enor oads
noone travel sother wise than on horseback

oh all this priesthood

etc
ontheotherhand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire
good said she tom adem oise lle baptist in emons eign eur began with other people but he has had to win dup with himself after all
he has regulated all his charities
nowhere are three thousand francs for us
atlas t
that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister am emorandum conceived in the following terms expenses of carriage and circuit
for furnishing meats oup to the patient sin thehospital

those who had an dth ose who lacked knocked at m
my riel 's door the latter insearchof the alms which the former came to deposit
in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress
considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his barenecessities
farfrom it
asthere isalways more wretchedness below than the reis brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received
it was like water on dry soil nomatter how much money here ceived henever had any

the usage being that bishops shall announce the irb aptis mal names at the head of the irc harges and the irpas to rall etters the poor people of the countryside had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenomen soft heir bishop that which had a meaning for the man dthe yn ever called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome

moreover this appellation please dhim

chapter iii ahard bishopric for a good bishop the bishop did not omit his pastoral visit sbec aus eheh adcon verted his carriage into a lms
the diocese of disa fatiguing one
the rear every few plains and agreat many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen thirtytwo curacies for tyone vicars hips and twohundred and eight yfi veaux iliary chapel s
tovisit all the seis quite a task
the bishop managed to do it
he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted spring cart when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains
the two oldwomen accompanied him
when the trip was too hard for the mhe went alone
one day hear rived at senez which is an ancient episcopal city
he was mounted on an ass
his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him anyother equipage
the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes
some of the citizens were laughing around him
monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens iper ceive that is hocky ou
you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesuschrist
ihave done so from necessity iass urey ouan dnot from vanity
in the course of the set rips he was kinda ndin dulg entand talked rather than preached
henever went far insearchof his arguments and his example s
he quoted to the inhabitants of one district theexample of an eighbor in gdis trict
in the cantons where the ywe re harsh to the poor hesaid look at the people of brian con
the yhave conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have the irm eadows mown three days in advance of everyone else

if at the harvest season the father of afamily has his son away on service in the army and hisdaughter sat service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommend shim to the prayers of the congregation and onsunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the village men women and children goto the poor man 's field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his grain to his granary
to families divided by questions of money and inheritance hesaid look at the mountaineers of devol nyac ountry so wild that the nightingale is not heard the reon cein fifty years
well when the father of afamily dies the boys go off to see kthe irf or tunes leaving the property to the girls sothat the yma yfind husband s
to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined the mselves in stamped paper hesaid look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras
the rear eth reeth ousands ouls of the m

it is like alittle republic
neither judge norba iliff is known there
the mayor does everything
he allots the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritance swithout charge pronounce ssent ences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men
to villages where he found no school master he quoted on cemore the people of queyras do you know how they manage
he said
since alittle country of a dozen or fifteen heart hscan not always support ateacher the yhave schoolmaster swho are paid by the whole valley whom a kether ound of the village sspe nding aweek in this one tendays in that and instruct the m

but what a disgrace to be ignorant
do like the people of queyras
thus he discourse dgra vel yand paternally in default of examples hein vented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic for me dthe real eloquence of jesus christ
and being convinced himself he was persuasive
chapter iv works corresponding to words his conversation was gay and affable
he put himself on a level with the two oldwomen who had passed the irl ives beside him
when he laughed it was the laugh of aschool boy
madame magloire like dtoc all him your grace votre grandeur
one day hero sef rom his armchair and went to his library insearchof abook
this book was on one of the upper shelves
as the bishop was rather short of stature hecould not reach it
madame magloire said he fetch me achair
my great ness grandeur does not reach a sfar as that she lf
one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lora rely allowed anopportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons
she had numerous relative swhower every old and near to death and of whom he rsons were the natural heirs
the youngest of the three was to receive from agranda untag ood hundred thousand livres of income these cond was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather
the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to the sein nocent and pardonable maternal boasts
on one occasion however heap peared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de low as relating onceagain the details of all the sein heritance sandal lthe see xpectations
she interrupted her self impatiently mon dieu cousin
what are you think i ngabo ut
iam thinking replied the bishop of asin gular remark which is to be found ibelieve in st
august in e'p lacey our hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit
' at another time on receiving anotification of the decease of agentleman of the countryside where in notonly the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page what a stout back death has
he exclaimed
what astrange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much wit must men have inorder thus to press the tomb in to the service of vanity
he was gifted on occasion with agent lerai llery which almost always concealed aserious meaning
in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came to dan dpr each edin the cathedral
he was tolerably eloquent
the subject of his sermon was charity
he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable
among the audience there was a wealth yr etired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer name dm
gebo rand who had amassed two million sin them anufacture of coarse cloths erges and woollen galloons
never in his whole life had m
gebo rand bestowed a lms on any poor wretch
after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a so ueve rys unday to the poor old beggar women at the door of the cathedral
the rewer esix of the mtos hare it
one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m
gebo rand purchasing paradise for a so u
when it was aquestion of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection
once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier awea lthy and avaricious oldman who contrived to be at one and the same time an ultra royalist and an ultra voltairian
this variety of man has actually existed
when the bishop came to him he touched his army oumu st give me something m
lemarquis
the marquis turned round and answered dryly ihave poor people of my own monseigneur
give the mtom ere plied the bishop
one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral my very dear brethren my goodfriend sthere are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in france which have butt hree opening seight een hundred and seventeenth ousand hovels which have butt woop ening sthe door and one window and three hundred and for tysi xth ousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door
and this arises from a thing which is called the taxon doors and windows
just put poor families oldwomen and little children in those buildings and behold the fever sand maladies which result

this please dthe people extremely and contribute dnot alittle to win him access to all spirit s
he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains
he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms
ashes poke all tongue she entered into all hearts
moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes
he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances in toaccount
he said examine the road over which the fault has passed
being a shed escribe dhim self with a smile an ex sinner he had no neo fthe asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinct ness and without the frown of the ferocious lyv irtu ousado ctr in ewh ich maybe summed up asfollows man has upon him his flesh which is a ton cehi sbur dena nd his temptation
he drags it with him and yields to it
he must watch it check it repress it and obey it only at the last extremity
the rema ybe some fault even in this obedience but the fault thus committed is venial it is a fall but afallon the knees which may terminate in prayer
to be asain tis the exception to be an upright man is the rule
err falls in ifyou will but be upright
the least possible sin is the law of man
no sin at all is the dream of the angel
all which is terrestrial issubject to sin
sinisa gravitation
when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh
oh
he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits
the sea re hypocrisies which have taken fright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter
he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest
he said the faults of women ofchildren of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husband sthe father sthe masters the strong the rich and the wise
he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things aspossible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces
this soul is full of shadows in isthere in committed
the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things is us pect that he obtained it from the gospel
one day he heard acriminal case which was inpreparation and onthe point of trial discussed in a drawing room
awret che dman being a tthe end of his resources had coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and forth echild which he had had by her
counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch
the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man
she was held butthere were no proof sex cept against her
she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession
she denied the yin sisted
she persisted in her denial
the re upon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown
he invented an infidelity on the part of the love rand succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was deceiving her
the re upon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all
the man was ruined
he was shortly to be tried at a ix with his accomplice
the ywe re relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate
by bringing jealousy in to play hehad caused the truth to burst forth in wrath he had educed the justice of revenge
the bishop listened to all this in silence
when the yha dfi nished he inquired where are this man and woman to be tried
atthe court of assizes
he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried
at rag ice vento ccurred at daman was condemned to death for murder
he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been amount ebanka tfai rsand awriter for the public
the town to oka great interest in the trial
onthe eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill
apr ies twas needed to attend the criminal in his last moments
the yse nt for the cure
it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine
ihave nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank it ooam illan dbes ides it is not myplace
this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right itisnot his place it is mine
he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell ofthe mountebank called him by name to ok him by the hand and spoke to him
he passed the entire day with him for get ful of food and sleep praying to go dfort he soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own
he told him the best truth swhich are also the most simple
he was father brother friend hewas bishop only to bless
he taught him everything encouraged and console dhim
the man was on the point of dying in despair
death was an abyss to him
ashes to odtr embling on its mournful brink here coiled with horror
he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent
his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in amanner broken through hereandthere that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life
he gazed incessantly beyond this world through the sefat al breaches and beheld only darkness
the bishop made him seelight
onthe following day when the ycam et of etch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there
he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple camail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck sidebyside with the criminal bound with cords
he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him
the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant
he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god
the bishop embraced him and atthe moment when the knife was about to fall hesaid to him go drais esfr omthe dead him who mman slays he who mhis brothers have rejected find shi sfat her once more
pray believe enter into life the father is the re
when he descended from the scaffold the rewa ssome thing in his look which made the people draw aside to let him pass
the ydi dnot know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor or his serenity
on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace hesaid to his sister ihave just officiated pontifical ly
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood the rewer epeople in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation
this however was a remark which was confined to the drawing room s
the populace which perceive sno jestin holy deeds was touched and admired him
as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was along time before her ecover edf rom it
infact when the scaffold is the real lere cted and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination
one may feel acertain indifference to the death penalty on ema yref rain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no solo ngas one has not seen aguillo tine with one 's own eyes but if one encounters one of the mthe shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against
some admire it like demais treo the rsexec rate it like beccaria
the guillotine is the concretion of the law itis called vindi cte it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral
he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers
all social problems erect the irin terr ogat ion point around this chopping knife
the scaffold is a vision
the scaffold is not apiece of carpentry the scaffold is not amachine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords
it seems as though it were abeing possessed of iknow not what sombre initiative on ewo ulds ayth atthis piece of carpenter 's work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and the secord swere possessed of will
in the frightful meditation in to which it spres ence cast sthe soul the scaffold appears in terrible guise and asthough taking part in what is going on
the scaffold is the accomplice of the execution erit devours it eats flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenter aspect re which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed
the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him
he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself
attimes he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice
this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved idid not think that it was so monstrous
it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law
death belongs to go dalone
by what right dome ntouch that unknown thing
in course of time the sei mpressions weakened and probably vanished
nevertheless it was observed that the bishop the ncef or tha voided passing the place of execution
m
my riel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying
he did not ignore the fact that the rein lay his greatest duty and his greatest labor
widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord
he understood how to sitdown and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child
as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech
ohad mirable console r
he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignify it by hope
he said have a car eof the manner in which you turn towards the dead
think not ofthat which perishes
gazes tea dil y
you will perceive the living light of your wellbeloved dead in the depths of heaven
he knew that faith is wholesome
he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him there signed man and to transform the grief which gazes upon agrave by showing him the grief which fixes it sga zeu ponas tar

this brief slumber was profound
in the morning he meditated for an hour the nhes aid his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house

charges to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state onthe other the holy see and athousand matters of business
what time was left to him after the set housand details of business and his office sand his breviary he bestowed first onthe necessitous the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work
sometimes he dug in his garden again here ador wrote
he had but one word for both the seki nds of toil he called the mgarden in g
the mind is a garden said he
towards midday when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or into wno fte nenter in glow lyd well in gs
he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long can ecla dinh is wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large bullion to droop from its three points
it was aperfect festival where ver heap peared
one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it

on his return hedin ed
the dinner resembled his breakfast
at half past eight in the evening he supped with his sister madame magloire standing behind the man dser vingt he matt able
nothing could be more frugal than this repast
if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire to oka dvantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains
every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal the bishop did not interfere
with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oils oup
thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the cheer of a cure he indulge sin the cheer of a trappist
after supper he converse dfor half an hour with mademoiselle baptist in eandm adam emag loire the nhere tired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio
he was a man of letters and rather learned
he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts amongothers adiss erta tion on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated up on the water s
with this verse he compares three texts the arabic verse which says the wind so fg odb lew flavius josephus who says awind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos which renders it awind coming from god blew up on the face of the water s
inanother dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemais great grand uncle to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that tothis bishop must be attributed the divers little work spu blished during the last century under the pseudonym of barley court

toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and betook themselves to the irc hambers on the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor
it is necessary that we should inthis place give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of dcha pter vi who guarded his house for him the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of aground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above
behind the house was a garden aquarterof an acre in extent
the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below
the first room opening on the streets erved him as diningroom the second was his bedroom and the third his or at or y
the rewa snoe xit possible from this oratory except bypassing through the bedroom nor from the bedroom with out passingthrough the dining room
atthe endofthe suite in the oratory the rewa sade tached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality
the bishop of fered this bed to country curates who mbusiness or the requirements of the irpa rishe sbr ought to dthe pharmacy ofthe hospital as mall building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar
inaddition to this there was in the garden astable which had formerly been the kitchen ofthe hospital and inwhichthe bishop kept two cows
nomatter what the quantity of milk the yga vehe invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital
iam paying my tithes hesaid
his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather
as wood isextremely dear at dhe hit upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cowshed
here he passed his evenings during season so fse vere cold he called it his winter salon
in this winter salon asin the dining room there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four straws eat edc hair s
inaddition to this the dining room was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted pink in watercolor s
out of asimilar sideboard properly draped with white napery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his or at or y

when bychan ceh erec eived seven or eight persons at one time the prefect or the general or the staff of the regiment in garrison or several pupils from the little seminar ythe chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable the pried ie ufrom the oratory and the armchair from the bedroom in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors
aroom was dismantled for each new guest
itsometimes happened that the rewer et we lve in the party the bishop the nrel ieved the embarrassment of the situation bystanding infront of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer
the rewa sstill another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs sothat it was ofservice only when propped against the wall
mademoiselle baptist in ehad also in her own room avery large easy chair of wood which had formerly been gilded and which was covered with flower edp ekin but the yha dbe enob lige dto hoist this berger eu ptot he first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture
mademoiselle baptist in e 's ambition had been to be able to purchase as et of drawing room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in swan 's neck style with a sofa
but this would have cost fivehundred francs atleast and in view of the fact that she had only been able to lay by forty two francs and tens ous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by renouncing the idea
however who is the re who has attained his ideal
nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishop 's bedchamber
agla zedd oor opened on the garden opposite this was the bed ahospital be dof iron with a canopy of green sergei nthe shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still be tray edt heel egan thabit soft heman of the world there were two doors on enea rthe chimney opening into the oratory the other near the book case opening into the dining room
the book case was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted torepresent marble and habitually without fire
in the chimney stood apair of fire dog so firon ornamented above with two garland ed vases and fluting swhich had formerly been silver ed with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the chimneypiece hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on abackground of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding hadfallen near the glass door alarge table with an inkstand loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table ana rmc hair of straw in front of the bed apr ie die ubo rrow edf rom the oratory

the bishop of ten called attention to it how delightful that is
he said
all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor aswell as those on the first floor were whitewashed which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals
however intheir latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornament in gthe apartment of mademoiselle baptist in eas weshall see further on
before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois
hence this decoration
the chamber swere paved in redbrick swhich were washed every week with straw mats infront of all the beds
altogether this dwelling which was attended to bythe two women was exquisite lyc lean from toptobottom
this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted
he said that takes nothing from the poor
it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possession ssi xsilver knives and for ksan das oup ladle which madame magloire contemplated everyday with delight as the ygl is ten eds plen did lyu pont he coarse line ncl oth
and since we are now painting the bishop of dashew asin reality we must add that he had said more than once ifind it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from agreat aunt
the sec and lest i cks held two wax candles and usually figure dont he bishop 's chimneypiece
when he had anyone to dinner madame magloire light edt he twocan dles and set the candlesticks on the table
in the bishop 's own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and for ksan dthe big spoon everynight
but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed
the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly building swhich wehave mentioned was composed of four alleys in cross for mrad iating from a tank
another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it
the sea lley sleft behind the mfour square plots rimmed with box
in three of the sema dame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers hereandthere stood a few fruit trees
madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot
it would be better to grow salads the retha nbo uqu ets
madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken
the beautiful is a suse fula sthe useful
head deda fter apause more soper haps
this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books
he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming hoeing and making holes hereandthere in the earth into which he dropped seeds
he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him
moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method het ook part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus
he did not study plants he loved flowers
here spected learned men great lyh eres pected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in the set wore spec tshe water edhi sflower beds every summer evening with a tin watering pot painted green
the house had not asingle door which could be locked
the door of the dining room which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of apriso n
the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch
all that the first pass erby had to do at any hour was to give it apush
atfirst the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de dha dsa id to the mha vebo ltsp uton your room sift hat will please you
the yha dende dby sharing his confidence or by atleast acting as though the ysh are dit
madame magloire alone had fright sfrom time to time
as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or atleast indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priests hould always be open
on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note am not iaph ysician like the m
ialso have my patients and the nto oih ave some who micall my unfortunate s
again he wrote donot inquire then a meof him who asks as he lter of you
the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter
it chance dthat a worthy cure iknow not whether it was the cure of coul ou broux or the cure of pompier ryt ook it into his head to ask him on eday probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an indiscretion to acertain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of anyone who should choose to enter and whether in short hedid not fear lest some misfortune might occur in ahouses olittle guarded
the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodie rit do mumin van um vigilant qui custodi untea mun less the lord guard the house in vain doth eyw at chw hog uard it
the nhesp ok eofs omething else
he was fond of saying there is a brave ryo fthe priest aswellasthe bravery of a colonel of dragoon son lyh eadd edo urs must be tranquil
chapter vii cravatte it is here that afact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show us best what sort of amant he bishop of dwas
after the destruction of the band of gaspard be swho had infested the gorge so follio ules one of his lieutenants cravatte to okre fuge in the mountains
he concealed himself for sometime with his band its there mnan to fga spa rdb es 's troop in the county of nice then he made his way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity of barcelone tte
he was first seen at ja uzi erst he nat tuiles
he hid himself in the caverns of the jou gdel ' aigle and the nceh edesc ended towards the hamlet sand villa gest hrough the ravines of ubaye and ubaye tte
he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy
his highway robberies laid waste the countryside
the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain
he always escaped sometimes here sisted by main force
he was a bold wretch
in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived
he was making his circuit to chaste la r
the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps
cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as a rche and beyond the rewa sda ngere ven with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose
therefore said the bishop ii nten dtogo without escort
you do not really meant hat monseigneur
exclaimed the mayor
id omean its otho roughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour
set out
set out

monsieur le maire said the bishop is that really all
iam not intheworld to guard my own life but to guard souls
the yha dtoa llow him to do as he pleased
he set out accompanied only by achild who offered to serve as a guide
his obstinacy was bruited about the countryside and caused great consternation

said the bishop
let us announce our ted eu mfrom the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure
things will arrange themselves
the yin stituted asearch in the church esoft he neighborhood
all the magnificence of the seh umble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly
while the ywe re thus embarrassed alarge chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horsemen who departed on the instant
the chest was opened it contained a cope of cloth of gold amit re ornamented with diamonds anarch bishop 's cross am a gnif ice ntc rosie rall the pontifical vestments which had been stolen amonth previously from the treasury of notre dame d' embrun
in the chest was a paper on which the sew or dsw erew ritten from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu

said the bishop

monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile

the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god
when he returned to chaste lart he people came out to stare at him as a tac urios it yalla long the road
atthe priest 's house in chaste larhe rejoined mademoiselle baptist in eandm adam emag loire who were waiting for him and he said to his sister well

the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and here turns from the mwith his hands full

those are dangers from without petty dangers
let us fear ourselves

what matters it what threatens our head or our purse
let us think only of that which threatens our soul

that which his fellow does god permits
let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that adang erisa pproach in gus
let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account
however such incidents were rare in his life
were late those of which we know but generally hepa ssed his life in doing the same thing sat the same moment
one month of his year resembled one hour of his day
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun weshould be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate
stolen the yha dal ready been elsewhere
halfofthe adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor
however we make no assertions on this point
only arather obscure not ewas found among the bishop 's paper swhich maybe a rso mere lation to this matter and which is couched in the set erms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital

near the seated man stood ayoung boy theshepherd lad
he was offering the old man ajar of milk
while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke thankyou hesaid in eed nothing
and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child
the bishops teppe dfor ward
atthe sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sumtotal of the surprise which aman can still feel after along life
this is the first time since i have been here said he that anyone has entered here
whoareyou sir
the bishop answered my name is bienvenu myriel
bienvenu myriel
ihave heard that name
are you the man who mthe people call monseigneur welcome
iam
the old man resume dwith ahalf smile in that case you are my bishop
something of that sort
enter sir
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
the bishop confined himself to the remark iamp leased to see that ihave been misinformed
you certainly do not seem to me to be ill
monsieur replied the old man iam going to recover
he paused and the nsaid is hall diet hree hours hence
the nhec ontinued iams omething of adoctor iknow in what fashion the last hour draws on
yesterday only my feet were cold today the chill has ascended to my knees now if eel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart is hall stop
the sun is beautiful is it not
ihad myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things
you can talk to me it does not fatigue me
you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death
it is well that the res hould be witnesses at that moment
one has one 's caprice sis hould have liked to last until the dawn but i know that is hall hardly live three hours
it will be night the n
what does it matter after all
dying is a simple affair
one has no need of the light for that
so be it
ishall die by starlight
the old man turned to the shepherd lad goto thy bed thou wert awake all lastnight thou art tired
the child entered the hut
the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself is hall die while he sleeps
the two slumber smay be good neighbors
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been
he did not think he discerned godin this manner of dying let us say the whole forth ese petty contradictions of great heart smus tbe indicated like the rest he who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at notbeing address edas monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen
he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him
this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe
meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished possibly that humility which is so fitting when one is ontheverge of returning to dust
the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach inconnection with any other man
amember of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even ofthe law of charity
gcal mhis body almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist
the revolution had many of the semen proportion edt othe epoch
in this oldman one was conscious of a man put to the proof
though so near to his end he preserved all the gestures of health
in his clear glance in his firm to nein the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to disconcert death
azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door
gsee med to be dying because he will edit so
the rewa sfree domin his agony
his legs alone were motionless
it was the retha tthe shadows held him fast
his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light
gatt his solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below
the rewa sast one there
the bishops at down
the exordium was abrupt
icon gratulate you said he inthe to new hich one uses for a reprimand
you did not vote for the death of the king after all
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
here plied
the smile had quite disappeared from his face
don otc on gratulate met oom uchs ir
id id vote for the death of the tyrant
it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity
what do you mean to say
resume dthe bishop
imean to say that man has a tyrant ignorance
ivote dfort he death of that tyrant
that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority right lyu nders to od
man should be governed only by science
and conscience added the bishop
it is the same thing
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very new to him
the member of the convention resume dso far as louis xvi
was concerned is a id ' no
' id id not think that i had the right to kill a man but if eltit my duty to exterminate evil

ihave aided in the overthrow of prejudice sander rors
the crumbling away of prejudice sander rors causes light
wehave caused the fall of the old world and the old world that vase of miseries hasbecome through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy
mixed joys aid the bishop
you may say trouble dj oyan dtod a ya fter that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared
alas
the work was incomplete iad mit wed emo lished the ancient regime in deeds wewere notable to suppress it entirely in ideas
to destroy abuse sis not sufficient custom smus tbem odified
the mill is the reno longer the wind is still there
you have demolished
it may be of use to demolish but i distrust adem olition complicated with wrath
right has its wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress
inanycase and inspite of whatever may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
incomplete it may be but sublime
it setfree all the unknown social quantities its often eds pirit sit calmed appeased enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth
it was a good thing
the french revolution is the consecration of humanity
the bishop could not refrain from murmuring yes
'
the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed sofa rasa dying man is capable of exclamation a hthe re you go '
iwase xpect in gthat word
acl oudh adbe enform in gforth espace of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst
you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something with in him had suffered extinction
nevertheless he put a good face on the matter
here plied the judges peaks in the name of justice the priests peaks in the name of pity which is not hing but amore lofty justice
at hunder bolts hould commit noerror
and head dedre garding the member of the convention steadily the while louis xvi i
the convention ary stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishop 's arm
louis xvi i
let us see
for whom do you mourn
is it for the innocent child
very good in that case imo urn with you
is it for the royal child
idem and time for reflection
to me the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place degreve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv
an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv
monsieur said the bishop ilike not this conjunction of names
cartouche
louis xv
towhich of the two doyou object
amoment ary silence ensued
the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken
the convention ary resume dahm on sieur priest you love not the crudities of the true
chris tlove dthe m
he seized a rodan dclear edo utt he temple
his scourge full of lightning swas ahar shsp eaker of truth s
when he cried 's in it epa rvu los ' he made no distinction between the little children
it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of her od
innocence monsieur is it so wncr own
innocence has no need to be a high ness
it is a saugus tin rags asin fleurs de lys
that is true said the bishop in a low voice
ipersist continued the convention ary gyou have mentioned louis xvi i
to me
let us come to anunderstanding
shall we weep for all the innocent all martyrs all children the lowly aswellasthe exalted
iagree to that
but in that case as ihave to ldy ouwe must go back further than 'and our tears must be gin before louis xvi i
iwill we epw it hyou over the children of kings provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people
i weep for all said the bishop
equally
exclaimed convention ary gandi fthe balance must incline let it be on the side of the people
the yhave been suffering longer
another silence ensued
the convention ary was the first to break it
her aised himself on one elbow to oka bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanical ly when one interrogate sand judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony
it was almost an explosion
yes sir the people have been suffering along while
and hold
that is not all either why have you just question edme and talked to me about louis xvi i
iknow you not
eversince ihave been in the separ tsi have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and seeing noone but that child who helps me
your name has reached me in a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced imus tad mit but that signifies nothing clever men have soma nyways of imposing on that honest goodman the people
bytheway idid not hear the sound of your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the fork of the road snod ou bt

to whom do is peak
whoareyou
the bishop hung his head and replied vermis sum iamaw or m
a worm of the earth in a carriage
growled the convention ary
it was the convention ary 's turn to be arrogant and the bishop 's to be humble
the bishop resume dmi ldl yso be its ir
but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces of fbe hind the trees yonder how my good table and the moorhens which i eaton friday how my twenty five thousand francs income how mypal ace and my lack eys prove that clemency is not a duty and that ' was not inexorable
the convention ary passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away acl oud
before replying to you hesaid ibes eec hyou to pardon me
ihave just committed a wrong sir
you are at myhouse you are my guest ioweyou courtesy

let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me
where were we
what were you saying to me
that ' was inexorable
inexorable yes said the bishop
what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine
what think you of bossuet chanting the ted eumo vert he dragon nades
the retort was a harsh on ebu tit attained its mark with the directness of apoint of steel
the bishop quivered under it noreply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of all uding to bossuet
the best of mind swill have the irf etic he sand they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic
the convention ary began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breath sinter rupted his voice still there was aperfect lucidity of soul in his eyes
he went on let me say afew words more in this and that direction iam willing
apart from the revolution which take nasa whole is an immense human affirmation 'is alas

' giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience
what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to amother
bear this well in mind sir the french revolution had its reasons for existence its wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better
from its most terrible blow sthere comes forth a car ess for the human race
i abridge is to piha veto omu cht head vantage moreover iam dying
and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the convention ary concluded his thoughts in the set ran qui lword syes the brutalities of progress are called revolution s
when the yare over this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed
the convention ary doubted not that he had success ively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop
one remained however and from this intrenchment the last resource of monseigneur bienvenu 's resistance came forth this reply where in appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning progress should be lieve in god
good cannot have an impious servitor
he who is an atheist is but abad leader for the human race
the former representative of the people made noreply
he was seized with a fit of trembling
he looked towards heaven and in his glance at ear gathered slowly
when the eyelid was full the tear trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and tohimself while his eyes were plunged in the depths otho u
oidea l
thou alone exist est
the bishop experience dani ndesc riba blesh ock
after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said the infinite is
heist here
if the infinite had no person person would be without limit itwould not be infinite inotherwords itwould not exist
the reist henan i
that i ofthe infinite is god
the dying man had pronounced the selas two rds in aloud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld someone
when he had spoken his eyes closed
the effort had exhausted him
it was evident that he had just lived through in amoment the few hours which had been left to him
that which he had said brought him near erto him who is in death
the supreme moment was approaching
the bishop understood this time pressed it was a sapri est that he had come from extreme cold ness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those close deyes he took that wrinkled aged and icecold hand in his and bentover the dying man
this hour is the hour of god
do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain
the convention ary opened his eyes again
agra vity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance
bishop said he with a slowness which probably arose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength ihave passed mylife in meditation study and contemplation
iwas sixty years of age when mycountry called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs
i obeyed

and iacc ept this is olation of hatred without hating anyone myself
now i am eightysix years old iam on the point of death
what is it that you have come to ask of me
yourblessings aid the bishop
and he knelt down
when the bishop raised his head again the face of the convention ary had become a ugust
he had just expired
the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thought swhich can not be known to us
he passed the whole night in prayer
onthe following morning some bold and curious person sat tempted to speak to him about member of the convention ghec on tented himself with pointing heavenward
from that moment here double dhist end erness and brother lyfe eling towards all children and sufferers
any allusion to that old wretch of a gca used him to fall into a singular preoccupation
noone could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his didnot count for something in his approach to perfection
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries
was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop
the rewa sevid ently noconv ersion to be expected
all those revolution is tsar eback sliders

he must have been very curious indeed to see as oulc arried of fby the devil
one day adowa gero fthe impertinent variety who thinks he rself spiritual address edt his sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when you rgreat ness will receive the red cap
oh
oh
that 's a coarse color replied the bishop
it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat
chapter xi are strict ion weshould in cura great risk of deceiving ourselves were wet ocon clude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop or apatriot icc ure
his meeting which may almost be designated as his union with convention ary glef tbe hindi tinh is mind as orto fast on ishment which rendered him still more gentle
that is all
although monseigneur bienvenu was far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the event soft hate poch supposing that monseigneur bienvenue ver dreamed of having a natti tude
let us the ngo back afew years
sometime after the elevation of m

the arrest of the pope to ok place as everyone knows on the night of the tht othe tho fju lyon this occasion m
my riel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris
this synod was held at notre dame and assembled for the first time on the tho fju neun der the presidency of cardinal fesch
m
my riel was one of the ninety five bishops who attended it
but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conference s
bishop of amount ain diocese living sover ycl oseto nature in rusticity and deprivation it appeared that he imported among the seemin ent person ages ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly
he very soon returned to dhew asin terr ogat edas to this speed yr eturn and here plied iemba rras sed the m
the outside air penetrated to the mthr ough me

on another occasion he said what would you have
those gentlemen are prince s
iam only a poor peasant bishop
the fact is that he displeased the m

what beautiful carpets
what beautiful liveries
the ymu st be agreat trouble
iwould not have all those superfluities crying incessantly in my ears 'the rear epeople who are hungry
the rear epeople who are cold
the rear epo or people
the rear epo or people
' let us remark bytheway that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred
this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts
nevertheless inch urch men luxury iswrong except in connection with representation sand ceremonies
it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about the m
an opulent priest is acontradiction
the priest must keep close to the poor
now canon ecome incontact incessantly night and day with all this distress all the semi sfor tunes and this poverty without having about one 's own personal it tleo fthat misery like the dust of labor
is itpossible to imagine a man near abra zier who is not warm
canon eima ginea work man who is working near a furnace and who has neither as in ged hair no rblack ened nails no rad ropo fsw eat nora speck of ashes on his face
the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty
this is no doubt what the bishop of dth ought
it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the idea soft he century once rtain delicate points
he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly press edit seems that he would have been found to be an ultra montaner at her than a gallican
since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline
beginning with hega vein his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations
here fused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayer sfor the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days
besides his sister mademoiselle baptist in eheh adt wobr other son eagen eral the other apr efect
he wrote to both with tolerable frequency
he was harsh for a time to ward sthe former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor asthough the latter had been aperson who mon eis desirous of allowing to escape
his correspondence with the other brother the expref ect afin eworth yman who lived in retirement at paris rue cassette remained more affectionate
thus monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud
the shadow of the passion soft he moment traverse dthis grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions
let the reben omist a keast oour meaning wear en otc on founding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic human ewh ichino urdays hould beth every foundation of every generous intellect
without going deep lyin to questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book wewill simply say this itwould have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royal istand if his glance had never been for asingle instant turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the fiction sand the hatred soft his world above the storm yvi cissi tudes of human things the beaming of those three pure radiance strut hjust ice and charity
while admitting that it was not for apolitical office that god created monseigneur welcome weshould have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just but perilous resistance to the allpowerful napoleon
but that which please susin people who are rising please sus less in the case of people who are falling
we only love the fray solo ngas the reis danger and inanycase the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminator soft helas t

as for us when providence intervene sands trikes we let it work
commenced to disarm us
in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation
and it was a crime to applaud in inthe presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill toanother insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head
in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver attheir sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot aheart like that of the bishop of dough tnot perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of agreat nation and agreat man on the brink of the abyss
with this exception he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence
he was a priest as a geand aman
it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more soper haps than we who are speaking here
the porter of the townhall had been placed the re by the emperor
he was an old noncommissioned officer of the old guard amember of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist as the eagle
this poor fellow occasionally lets lipin consider a terema rks which the law the nstig matized assed it ious speeches
after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor henever dressed himself in his regiment alsa shesaid sothat he should not be obliged to wear his cross
he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and hewould not put anything in its place
iwill die hesaid rather than we art het hree frogs upon my heart
he liked to scoff aloud at louis xviii
the gouty old creature in english gaiters
he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his
he was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detested prussia and england
he did it so often that he lost his place
the re he was turned out of the house with his wife and children and without bread
the bishops ent for him reproved him gently and appointed him beadle in the cathedral
in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy deeds and gentleman ners filled the town of dwith as orto fte nder and filial reverence
even his conduct towards napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned as it were bythe people the good and weakly flock who adored the irem per or but love dthe irbis hop

chapter xiii what he believed wear en oto blige dtos ound the bishop of dont he score of orthodoxy
in the presence of such as oul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect
the conscience of the justman should be accepted on his word
moreover certain nature sbe in ggi ven we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own
what did he think of this dogma or ofthat mystery
the ses ecrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where souls enter naked
the point on which we are certain isthat the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case
node ca yisp ossible to the diamond
he believed to the extent of his powers
credo in patrem he often exclaimed
moreover he drew from goodworks that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to amant houart with god
the point which weconsider it our duty to note is that outside of andbeyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love
it was in that quarter quia multum amavit because he loved much that he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry
what was this excess of love
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended event othing s
he lived with out disdain
he was indulgent towards god 's creation
every man event hebes thas within him at hough tless harshness which he reserves for animals
the bishop of dha dnon eof that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless
he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes who know eth whither the soul of the animal goeth
hideousness of aspect deformity of instinct trouble dhim not and did not arouse his indignation
he was touched almost softened by the m
it seemed as though he went thoughtfully away to see kb eyond the bounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation or the excuse for the m
he seemed at times to be asking god to commute the sep enalties
he examined with out wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering apali mps est that portion of chaos which still exists in nature
this revery sometimes caused him to utter odds aying s
one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by him suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground itwas alarge black hair yfr ight fuls pider
his sister heard him say poor beast
it is not its fault
why not mention the sea lmost divinely childish saying so fkind ness
puerile the yma ybe but the ses ublime puerilities were peculiar to saint francis d' assisi and of marcusaurelius
one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant
thus live dthis just man
sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and the nthere was nothing more venerable possible
monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been ifthe stories an ent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed apass ionate and possibly a violent man
his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of agra ndc on viction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled the res low lyth ought by though tfor in acharacter asin arock the rema ye xist aperture smad eby drops of water
the seho llows are une fface able these formations are indestructible
in a sweth in kweh ave already said he reached his seventy fifth birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty
he was not tall he was rather plump and inorderto combat this tendency he was fond of taking long stroll son foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent adeta ilfr om which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion
gregory xvi
atthe age of eight yhe ldh imself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop
monseigneur welcome had what the people term afin ehead but so amiable was he that the yfor got that it was fine
when he converse dwith that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and ofwhich wehave already spoken people felt at the ire as ewith him and joys eemed to radiate from his whole person
his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man he'sa good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man
that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon
onthe first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but afin eman
but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured a ndt ooko nsome imposing quality iknow not what his broad and serious browren dered august byhis white locks became august also byvirtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feel on beholding asmiling angels low lyu nfold his wings without ceasing to smile
respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him on eof those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought i sso grand that it can nolonger bean ything but gentle
as we have seen prayer the celebration of the office so fre ligion almsgiving the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of abit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled everyday of his life
filled isexactly the word certainly the bishop 's day was quite full tothe brim of good words and good deeds
nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to be danda fter the two women had retired
it seemed to be as orto fri tewi th him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heaven s
sometimes i fthe two oldwomen were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walk sata very advanced hour of the night
he was the real one communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellation sand the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown
at such moments while he offered his heart atthe hour when nocturnal flowers offer the irp erfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starrynight as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation hecould not have to ldh imself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take it sflight from him and something descend into him
mysterious exchange of the abyss esoft he soul with the abyss esoft he universe
he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity past am ystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced the irwa yin to all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the incomprehensible he gazed upon it
he did not study god he was dazzled by him
he considered those magnificent conjunction sofa to msw hich communicate aspects to matter reveal for ces by verifying the mcreate individual ities in unity proportion sinex tent the innumerable in the infinite and through light produce beauty
the sec on junction sare for me dan ddis solved incessantly hence life and death
he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the punya nds tunt eds il houette so fhis fruit trees
this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so encumbered with mean building sands he dswa sdea rto him and satisfied his wants
what more was needed by this oldman who divided the leisure ofhis life where the rewa ssol it tle leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation atnight
was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to adore godin his most divine works in turn
does not this comprehend all infact
and what is the rele ft to desire beyond it
alittle garden inwhich to walk and immensity in which to dream
atone 's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked overhead that which one can study and meditate upon some flowers one arthan dall the stars in the sky
chapter xiv what he thought one last word
since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use anexpression now in fashion give to the bishop of dace rtain pantheistic alphy sio gnomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained on eof those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and the retake on a form and grow until the yusu rpt he place of religion weins is tupo nitt hat not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort
that which enlightened this man was his heart
his wisdom was made of the light which comes from the re
no systems many works
abstruse speculation scont ain vertigo not here is not hing toindicate that he risked his mind in apocalypse s
the apostle maybe daring but the bishop must be timid
hewould probably have felt as cru pleats ounding to ofari nadvance certain problems which are in amanner reserved for terrible great minds
the reis as a cred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy opening sstand yawning the rebuts omething tells you you apass erby in life that you must not enter
woe to him who penetrates thither
genius esint he impenetrable depth sofa bstract iona ndp ures peculations ituated soto speak above all dogmas propose the iride as to go d
the irp ray era udac iously offers discussion
the ira dorati on interrogate s
this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs
human meditation has no limit s
at his own risk and peril it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement
one might almost say that by a sort of splendid reaction itwith it dazzle snat uret he mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated
however that maybe there are one art hmen who are the ymen
perceived is tinctly at the verge of the horizon so fre very theheight soft he absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain
monseigneur welcome was one of the semen monseigneur welcome was not agenius
hewould have feared those sublimities when ces ome very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity
certainly the sep owerful reveries have the irmo ralut ility and bythesea rd uous paths one approach est oidea lper fection
as for him he took the path which shortens the gospel 's
he did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of elijah 's mantle he project ednor ayoff uture upon the dark groundswell of events hedid not see kto condense inflame the light of things he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him
this humble soul love dan dthat was all
that he carried prayer to the pitch of asuper human aspiration is probable but one can nomore pray to omu cht hanon ecan love to omu chandi fit is a heresy to pray beyond the text ssaint the resa and saint jerome would be here tics
he inclined to ward sall that groans and all that expiates
the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound
the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in finding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve
that which exists was for this good and rare priest apermanent subject of sadness which sought consolation
the rear emen who toil at extracting gold he toiled at the extraction of pity
universal misery was his mine
the sadness which reigned everywhere was butane xcuse for unfailing kindness
love eachother he declared this to be completed esired nothing further and that was the whole of his doctrine
one day that man who believe dhim self to be a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop just survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit
your love eachother is nonsense
well replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself up in it as the pearl in the oyster
thus he shut himself up heli ved the re he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipice so fmeta physics all those profundities which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal thetransformation in death there capitulation of existence swhich the tomb contains the incomprehensible grafting of successive love son the persistent it heessen cet he substance then i lean dthe enst he soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius man ousa in tpaul dante contemplate with eyes flashing light ning which seems byits steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze for ththe re
monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing the man dwith out troubling his own mind with the man dwh ocher is hedin his own soul agrave respect for darkness

he was a man of medium stature thick set and robust in the prime of life

his shirt ofcoarse yellow line nfast ened at the neck by asmall silver anchor permitted aview of his hair ybreast he had a cravatt wisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and to rnon the other anold gray tattered blouse patched on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewed on with twin eat ightly packed soldier knapsack well buckle dan dper fectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand irons hods hoes on his stocking less feet as have dhea dandal on gbear d
the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added iknow not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole
his hair was closely cut yet bristling for it had begun to grow alittle and did not seem to have been cut for sometime
noone knew him
he was evidently only achance passerby
when cecam ehe
from the south from the seashore perhaps for hema de his entrance into dby the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris
this man must have been walking all day
he seemed very much fatigue d
some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade
he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink twohundred pace sfu rther on a tthe fountain in the marketplace
on arriving at the corner of the rue poiche vert he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the townhall
he entered the nca me out aquarterof an hour later
agenda rme was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the tho fma rch to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants of dthe proclamation of the gulf juan

atthe time of the emperor 's landing many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this in no fthe three dauphin s
it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handful so fgold to the citizens
the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel ofthe prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had beta ken himself to the three dauphin s
this glory of the labarre of the three dauphin swas reflected upon the labarre of the cross of col basata distance of five and twenty league s
it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble
the man bent his steps towards this in nwhich was the best in the countryside
he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street

the host who was also the chief cook was going from one stewpan toanother very busily superintending anexcellent dinner designed for the wagoner swho selo udta lking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment

nothing easier replied the host
at that moment he turned his head to okint he traveller 's appearance with a single glance and added by paying for it
the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered ihave money
in that case wear eat your services aid the host
the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire

immediately replied the landlord
while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worthy host jacqui nlab arre drew a pencil from his pocket then to re off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window
onthe white margin he wrote aline or two folded it without sealing and the nint rusted this scrap of paper to achild whose emed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lack ey
the landlord whispered aword in the scullion 's ear and the child set of fonar unint hedir ection of the townhall

the child returned
he brought back the paper
the host unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply
he seemed to read it attentively the ntos sed his head and remained thoughtful for amoment

the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice iamat an in niamh ungry and is hall remain

at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron shod tip of his staff het urned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply thehost gazed steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop
the re 's enough of that sort of talk

the man cast aglance upon it
the landlord resume dafter apause

the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure

hewalked straight on a taven turek eeping close to the house slike as a dand humiliated man
he did not turn round asingle time
had he done so he would have seen the host of the cross of col bass tanding on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the passersby in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group hemight have divine dthat his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
he saw nothing of all this
people who are crushed donot lookbehind the m
the yknow but to owell the evil fate which follows the m
thus he proceeded for sometime walking on without ceasing traversing a trandom street so fw hich he knew nothing for get ful of his fatigue as is often the case when amani ssa d
all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply
night was drawing near
he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter
the fine hostel ryw as close dto him he was seeking some very humble public houses ome hovel however low ly
just the nal ight flash edu pat the end of the streets api nebra nchs uspended from across beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight
he proceeded thither
it proved to be in fact apublic house
the public house which is in the ruede chaff aut
the wayfarer halted for amoment and peeped through the window into the interior of the low studded room of the public house illuminated by asmall lamp on a table and byala rge fire on the heart h
some men were engaged in drinking there
the landlord was warming himself
aniron pots uspended from a crane bubble dover the flame
the entrance to this public house which is also as orto fan in nisby two doors
one opens on the street theother upon as mall yard filled with manure
the traveller dare not enter bythe street door
he slipped into the yard halted again the nra is edt he latch timidly and opened the door
who goes there
said the master
someone who wants supper and bed
good
we furnish supper and bed here
he entered
all the men who were drinking turned round
the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other
the ye xamine dhim for sometime while he was taking off his knapsack
the host said to him there is the fire
the supper is cooking in the pot
come and warm yourself comrade
he approached and seated himself near the heart h
he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire afin eod or was emitted by the pot
all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering best ows
it was more over a firm energetic and melancholy profile
this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeming humble and ended by seeming severe
the eyes hone beneath its lashes like a fire beneath brushwood
one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the ruede chaff auth adbe entos table his horse at labarre 's
it chance dthat he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras d' as sean diha vef or gotten the name

now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely wear yha dre quest edhi mtot akehi mon his crupper to which the fishmonger had made noreply except by redoubling his gait
this fishmonger had been amember half an hour previously ofthe group which surrounded jacqui nlab arrea ndha dhim self related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of col bas
from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign tothe tavernkeeper
the tavernkeeper went to him

the man had again become absorbed in his reflections
the tavernkeeper returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him you are going to get out of her e
the stranger turned round and replied gently a h
you know
yes
iwas sent away from the other in n
and you are to be turned out of this one
where would you have mego
elsewhere
the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of col basan dwh osee med to be lying in waitfor him threw stones at him
here traced his steps in anger and threatened the mwith his stick the children dispersed like a flock of birds
he passed before the prison
atthe door hung an iron chain attached to abell
her an g
the wicket opened
turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit mean dgiv emea lodging for the night
avoice replied the prison is not an in n
get your self arrested and you will be admitted
the wicket closed again
he entered alittle street inwhichthe rewer eman ygarden s
some of the mare enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful as pect to the street
in the midst of the sega rdens and hedges he caught sight of asmall house of asingle story the window of which was lighted up
he peered through the pane as he had done at the public house
within was a large white washed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and acra dle in one corner afew wooden chairs and adouble barrelled gunhan gingon the wall
atable was spread in the centre of the room
acop perl am pill umina ted the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter jugs hining like silver and filled with wine and the browns moking soup tureen
atthis tables at a man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was dandling alittle child on his knees
close by avery young woman was nursing another child
the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling
the stranger paused amoment in revery before this tender and calming spectacle
what was taking place within him
he alone could have to ld
it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld somuch happiness hewould find perhaps alittle pity
he tapped on the pane with a very small and feeble knock
the ydi dnot hear him
he tapped again
hehe ardt he woman say it seems to me husband that someone is knocking
no replied the husband
he tapped at hird time
the husband rose to okt helamp and went to the door which he opened
he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan
he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which ahammer are dhand kerchief apo wder horn and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle asin apocket caused to bulge out
he carried his head thrown back wards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his bull neck white and bare
he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a snout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable
pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you inconsideration of payment give me a plate of soup and acorn ero fthat she dyon der in the garden inwhich to sleep
tell me can you

demanded the master of the house
the man replied ihave just come from puy moisson

the traveller replied with embarrassment id on otk now
he did not receive me
have you been to what 's his name 's in the rue chaff aut
the stranger 's embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either
the peasant 's countenance assumed anexpression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder are you the man
he cast afresh glance upon the stranger to okt hree steps backwards place dthe lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall
meanwhile at the words are you the man
the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitate lybe hind herhusband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low to nets omar aud e
all this tookplace in less time than it requires topic ture it to one 's self
after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinize savi perth emaster of the house returned to the door and said clear out

as hot from my gun
said the peasant
the nhec lose dthe door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts
amoment later the windows hutter was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
night continued to fall
acold wind from the alps was blowing
by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the garden swhich bordered the street as orto fhu twhich seemed to him to be built of sods
he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden
he approached the hut its door consisted of avery low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which road laborers construct forthemselves along the road s
he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a road laborer he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was atleast a shelter from the cold
this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night
he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut
it was warmth ere and he found at ole rably good bed of straw
he lay for amoment stretched out on this bed with out the power to make a movement sofa tigue dwas he
the nast he knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover api llow ready to his hand he set about unbuckling one of the straps
at that moment afer ocious grow lbe came audible
her aised his eyes
the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut
it was a dog 's kennel
he was himself vigorous and formidable hear me dhim self with his staff made as hield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his rags
he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged inorderto keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing design at eas larose couverte
when he had not without difficulty repassed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge with out shelter without a roof over his head chase dev en from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on aston eandi tappe ars that apass erby heard him exclaim iam not even a dog
he soon rose again and resume dhism arch
he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the field swhich would afford him shelter
hewalked thus for sometime with his head still drooping
when he felt himself farfrom every human habitation her aised his eyes and gazed search in gly about him
he was in afield
before him was one of those lowhill scover ed with close cuts tub blew hich after the harvest resembles have dhea ds
the horizon was perfectly black
this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky
meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and asthere was still floating in the zenith are mnan to fthe brightness of twilight the sec loud sform eda tthe summit of the sky as orto fw hit is harch when cea gleam of light fell upon the earth
the earth was thus better light edt han the sky which produces a particular lysin is tere ffect and the hill whose contour was poor and mean was outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow
the rewa snothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered afew pace sdist an tfrom the wayfarer
this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and revery he turned back abruptly

he passed through a breach and entered the town again
it might have been eight o'clock in the evening
as he was not acquainted with the streets here commenced his walk atrandom
in this way he came to the prefecture the ntot he seminar y
as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church
atthe corner of this square there is a printing establishment

at that moment an old woman came out of the church

chapter ii prudence counsel led to wisdom
that evening the bishop of dafter his promenade through the town remained shutup rather late in his room
he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately
he was carefully compiling everything that the father sand the doctor shave said on this important subject
his book was divided into two parts first lythe duties of all secondly the duties of eachindividual according to the class to which he belongs
the duties of all are the great duties

as for the other duties the bishop found the mpoint edo utan dpr escribe del sew here to sovereign sands ubjects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to you ngm enb ysa in tpet erto husband sfat her schildren and servants in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrew sto virgin sin the epistle to the corinthians
outofthe sep recept she was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls
at eight o'clock he was still at work writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper with a big book open on his knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the silverware from the cupboard near his bed
amoment later the bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him shut his book rose from his table and entered the dining room
the dining room was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and awindow opening on the garden
madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the table
as she performed this service shewas conversing with mademoiselle baptist in e
alam pst ood on the table the table was near the fireplace
awood fire was burning the re
one can easily picture to one 's self these two women both of whom were over sixty years of age
madame magloire small plump vivacious mademoiselle baptist in egent les lender frail somewhat taller than herbrother dressed in a gown of puce colored silk ofthe fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted eversince
to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in asingle word to an idea which awhole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptist in ethat of a lady
madame magloire wore a white quilted cap ago ld jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that the rewa sin the house avery white fichu puffing out from ago wno fcoa rse black wool lens tuff with large shortsleeve san apron of cotton cloth in red and green check skn otted round the waist with agree nri bbon with a stomach ero fthe same attached by two pins at the upper corner scoar ses hoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles
mademoiselle baptist in e 's gown was cut on the pattern so fwith as hort waist anarrow sheath like skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons
she concealed her gray hair under a frizzed wig known as the baby wig
madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her arather crabbed and imperious look
solon gas monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like her mistress
mademoiselle baptist in edid not even speak
she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him
she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and along arched nose but he rwho levis age her whole person breathed for than ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning
she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues which mildly warmth eso ulh a dgrad ually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
nature had made her alambre ligion had made her anangel
poor saint ed virgin
sweet memory which has vanished
mademoiselle baptist in ehas so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that the rear eman ypeople now living who still recall the most minute details
atthe moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity
she was haranguing mademoiselle baptist in eona subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed
the question concerned the lockup on the entrance door
itappears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places
people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearance as us picious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into the irhe ads toreturn home late that night might be subject edt oun pleasant encounters
the police was very badly organized moreover because the rewa snol ovel ost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure eachother bymaking things happen
it behooved wise people to play the part of the irow npol ice and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to duly close baran dba rric adet heir house sand to fasten the doors well
madame magloire emphasized the selas two rds but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold
he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and the nfe llt othin king of other things
he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire
she repeated it
the nmade moiselle baptist in edes iro us of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing herbrother venture dtos a yti mid lyd id you hear what madame magloire is saying brother
ihave heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop
the nhalf turning in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come what is the matter
what is the matter
are we in any great danger
the nma dame magloire began the whole story afresh exaggerating it alittle without being aware of the fact
it appeared that a bohemian abare footed vagabond as orto fda nger ous mendicant was a tthat moment in the town
he had presented himself at jacqui nlab arre 's too btain lodging sbu tthe latter had not been willing to take him in
he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roamabout the streets in the gloaming
aga llows bird with a terrible face
really
said the bishop
this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire its eemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming a larme dshe pursued triumphantly yes monseigneur
that is how it is
the re will be some sort of catastrophe in this town tonight
everyone says so
and with a lthe police is so badly regulated auseful repetition
the idea of living in amount aino us country and not even having lights in the streets at night
one goes out
black as ovens indeed
and is a ymo nse ign eur and mademoiselle the resa ysw it hmei interrupted his sister say nothing
what my brother does is well done
madame magloire continued as though the reha dbe enno protest we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will permit iwill go and tell paul in muse bois the locksmith to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors wehave the man ditis only the work of amoment for isa ythat nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a latch by the first pass erby and is a ythat weneed bolts monseigneur ifonly for this night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying ' come in 'and besides even in the middle of the night omondi eu
the reis none edt oas kper mission
at that moment there came at ole rably violent knock on the door
come in said the bishop
chapter iii the heroism of passive obedience
the door opened
it opened wide with a rapid movement as though someone had given it an energetic and resolute push
aman entered
we already know the man
it was the wayfarer who mwe have seen wandering about insearchof shelter
he entered advanced astep and halted leaving the door open behind him
he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hand arou ghau dacious wear yand violent expression in his eyes
the fire on the heart hlight edhi mup
he was hideous
it was a sinister apparition
madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry
she trembl edan dsto odw it hher mouth wide open
mademoiselle baptist in eturned round beheld the man entering and half started up in terror the ntu rning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calman dser ene
the bishop fixed at ran qui le yeon the man
as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired the man rested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak hesaid in aloud voices ee here

madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove

madame magloire retired to execute the seo rders
the bishop turned to the man
sitdown sir and warm yourself
we are going to supina few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are supping
atthis point the man suddenly comprehended
the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stupefaction of doubt of joy and became extraordinary
he began stammering like a crazy man really
what

he was the bishop of major eat marseilles
heist he cure who rules over the other cures you understand
pardon me is a ythat very badly but it is such a far off thing to me
you understand what we are
he said mass in the middle of the galleys on an altar
he had a point edt hing made of gold on his head it glittered in the bright light of midday
we were all ranged in line son the three sides with cannons with light edmat ches facing us
we could not see very well
he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear
that is what abish opis like
while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wideopen
madame magloire returned
she brought asilver for kand spoon which she placed on the table
madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire aspossible
and turning to his guest then i ght wind is harsh on the alps
you must be cold sir
each time that he uttered the words irin his voice which was so gently grave and polished the man 's face light edu p
monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa
ignominy thirst sfor consideration
this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop
madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimneypiece in monseigneur 's bedchamber and placed the mlight edon the table
monsieur le cures aid the many oua reg oody oud on otd espise me
your eceive mein to your house

yet ihave not concealed from you when ceic omean dthat iama nun fortunate man
the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand
you could not help telling me who you were
this is not myhouse it is the house of jesus christ
this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has an ameb ut whether he has a grief
you suffer you are hungry and thirsty you are welcome

that is what it is like
yes resume dthe bishop you have come from avery sad place
listen
the re will be more joy in heaven over the tear bathed face of a repentant sinner than over the white robes of a hundred just me n
if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of goodwill and of peace you are more worthy than anyone of us
in the meantime madame magloire had served supper soup made with water oil bread and salt alittle bacon abit of mutton figs afresh cheese and alarge loaf of ryebread
she had of her own accord added to the bishop 's ordinary fare abottle of his old mauve swine
the bishop 's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable nature s
totable
he cried vivaciously
as was his custom when astrange rsup ped with him he made the man sito nhis right
mademoiselle baptist in eper fectly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left
the bishop asked able ssing the nhelp edt he soup himself according to his custom
the man began to eat with a vidit y
all at once the bishops aid its trikes mether eiss omething missing on this table
madame magloire had infact only place dthe three sets of forks and spoons which were absolutely necessary
now it was the usage of the house when the bishop had anyone to supper to layout the whole six sets of silver onthe tablecloth an innocent ostentation
this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child 's play which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty in to dignity
madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying aword and amoment later the three sets of silver for ksan dsp oons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table
chapter iv details concerning the cheese dairies of pontarlier
now inorderto convey an idea of what passed at that table wecannot do better than to transcribe here apass age from one of mademoiselle baptist in e 's letters to madame bois chevron where in the conversation between the convict and the bishop isdescribed within genious minute ness
this man paid no attention to anyone
heat ewith the voracity of astar ving man
however after supper hesaid 'm on sieur lecure of the good god all this is far too good for me but i must say that the carter swhow ould not allow me to eat with the mke epa better table than you do
' between ourselves there mark rather shocked me
my brother replied 'the yare more fatigue dth an i
' ' no 're turned the man 'the yhave more money
you are poor is eet hat plainly
you can not be even acurate
are you really a cure
ahi fthe good god were but just you certainly ought to be a cure
' ' the good god is more than just 's aid my brother
amoment later head de d' monsieur jean valjean is it to pontarlier that you are going
' ' with my road marked out for me
'it hink that is what the man said
the nhew enton ' imus tbe on my way by daybreak tomorrow
travelling is hard
if the night sarec old the day sare hot
' ' you are going to ago odc ountry 's aid my brother
'd uring the revolution myfamily was ruined
it ook refuge in franche comte atfirst and the reili ved for sometime by the toil of my hands
my will was good
if ound plenty to occupy me
one has only to choose
the rear epaper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories on a large scale steel mills copperworks twenty iron foundries atleast four of which situated at lods at chatillon at audi nco urta ndat be urea re tolerably large
'it hink iam not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned
the nhei nterrupt edhi mself and address edme ' have we not some relatives in those parts my dear sister
' ire plied ' we did have some amongothers m
deluce net who was captain of the gates at pontarlier under the old regime
' ' yes 're sumed my brother 'but in ' one had no longer any relatives one had only one 's arms
iwork ed
the yhave in the country of pontarlier whither you are going monsieur valjean at ruly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister
it is the irc heese dairies which the ycall fruit iere s
'the nm ybr other while urging the man to eat explained to him with great minute ness what the sef ruit iere so fpo ntar lie rwe retha tthey were divided into two classes the big barns which belong to the rich and where the rear efort yor fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheese seach summer and the associated fruit iere swhich belong to the poor these are the peasants of mid mountain who hold the irc owsi ncomm on and share the proceeds
'the yen gage the services of a cheesemaker who mthe ycall the grur in the grur in receives the milk of the associate sthree times a day and marks the quantity on adouble tally
it is towards the end of april that the work of the cheese dairies begins it is towards the middle of june that the cheesemakers drive the irc ows to the mountains
'the man recovered his animation as he ate
my brother made him drink that good mauve swine which he does not drink himself because he says that wine is expensive
my brother imparted all the sede tails with that easy gayety of his withwhich you are acquainted interspersing his words with graceful attention stome
here curred frequently to that comfortable trade of grur in asthough hewish edt hemant ounders tan dwith out advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him are fuge
one thing struck me
this man was what i have to ldy ou
well neither during supper nord uring the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which could remind them an ofwhat he was no rof what my brother was
to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him alittle sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convicts othat amar kof the passage might remain behind
this might have appeared to anyone else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul aswell as his body and to be stow upon him some reproach season ed with moralizing and advice or alittle commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future
my brother did not even as khim from what country he came nor what was his history
for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it
to such a point did he carry it that atone time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pontarlier who exercise agent lela born ear heaven and who head deda re happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might wound the man
by dint of reflection ithink ihave comprehended what was passing in my brother 's heart
he was thinking nodoubt that this man who sename is jean valjean had his misfortune only to ovi vid lyp resent in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believe ifonly momentarily that he was aperson like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way
isnot this indeed tounderstand charity well
isthere not dear madam esome thing truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstain sfrom sermon from moralizing from all usions
and is not the true stp it ywh enama nhas as ore point not to touch it at all
it has seemed to me that this might have been my brother 's private thought
inanycase what i can say is that if he entertained all the seide as he gave no sign of the mfrom beginning to endevent ome he was the same as he is every evening and he supped with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m
gedeon leprovost or with the curate of the parish
towards the end when he had reached the figs the rec am ea knock at the door
it was mother gerbaud with her little one in her arms
my brother kissed the child on the browand borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother gerbaud
the man was not paying much he edt oan ything the n
he was nolonger talking and he seemed very much fatigue d
after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure my brother said grace the nhet urned to the man and said to him 'you must be in great need of your bed
'm adam emag loire cleared the table very promptly
iunder stood that we must retire in order to allow this traveller to go to sleep and web oth went upstairs
nevertheless is ent madame magloire down amoment later to carry tothe man 's bed ago at skin from the black forest which was in my room
the night sare frigid and that keeps on ewar m
it is a pity that this skin is old allthe hair is falling out
my brother bought it while he was in germany at tot tling ennea rthe sources of the danube aswellasthe little ivory handled knife which i use attable
