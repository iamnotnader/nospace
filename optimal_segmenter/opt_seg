muriel inn
charles francois bienvenu muriel was bishop of she was an old man of about seventy five years of age he had occupied these words once
although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous it merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various tumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese
true or false that which is said of men often occupied as important a place in their lives and above all in their destinies as that which they do
m
muriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of six hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar
it was said that his father destining him to be the heir of his own post had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families
in spite of this marriage however it was said that charles muriel created a great deal of talk
he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry
the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed
m
charles muriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution
there his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered
he had no children
what took place next in the fate of m
muriel
the ruin of the french society of the olden days the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of ' which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance with the magnifying powersofterror did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to germinate in him
waste in the midst of these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune
no one could have told all that was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest
ibm
muriel was the cure off brignol les
he was already advanced in years and lived in a very retired manner
about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his curacy just what is not precisely known took him to paris
among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners wash
le cardinal beach
one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle the worthy sure who was waiting in the anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed
napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man turned round and said abruptly who is this good man who is staring at me
site said m
muriel you are looking at a good man and i at a great man
each of us can profit by it
that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and some time afterwards m
muriel was utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of 'd what truth was there after all in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m
muriel 's life
no one knew
very few families had been acquainted with the muriel family before the revolution
m
muriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town where there are many mouths which talk and very few heads which think
he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop
but after all the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only noise sayings words less than words palabre was the energetic language of the south expresses it
however that maybe after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in call the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion
no one would have dared to mention them no one would have dared to recall them
m
muriel had arrived are accompanied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptist one who was his sister and ten years his junior
their only domestic was a female servant of the same areas mademoiselle baptist one and named madame magloire who after having been the servant of m
lecure now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur
mademoiselle baptist one was a long pale thin gentle creatures he realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems that a woman must needs be another in order to be venerable
she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency and as she advances in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness
what had been leanness in her youth had become transparency in her maturity and this diaphaneity allowed the angel to be seen
she was a soul rather than a virgin
her person seemed made of a shadow there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex a little matter enclosing a light large eyes forever dropping a mere pretext for a soul 's remaining on the earth
madame magloire was a little fat white old woman corpulent and bustling always out of breath in the first place because of her activity and in the next because of her asthma
on his arrival m
muriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop immediately after a major general
the mayor and the president paid the first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the general and the prefect
the installation over the town waited to see it 's bishop at work
chapter ii m
muriel becomes m
welcome the episcopal palace off adjoins the hospital
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m
henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris abbe of si more who had been bishop of sin
this palace was a genuine seignorial residence
everything about it had a grand air the apartments of the bishop the drawing rooms the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees
in the dining room along and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the gardens m
henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles brul art de genius archbishop prince d' embrun antoine de mes grigny the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand prior of france abbe of saint honore de l' erin 's francois de berton de crillon bishop baron de vence cesar des a brands forcalquier bishops signor of glance brand jeans lan en priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishops signor of sends
the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable date theft of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble
the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden
three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital
the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house
monsieur the director of the hospital said he to him how many sick people have you at the present moment
twenty six monseigneur
that was the number which i counted said the bishop
the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other
that is what i observed
the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them
so it seems to me
and then when there is a day of sun the garden is very small for the convalescents
that was what i said to myself
in case of epidemics we have had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at times we know not what to do
that is the thought which occurred home
what would you have monseigneur
said the director
one must resign one 's self
this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the ground floor
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital
monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold
monseigneur 's dining room
exclaimed the stupefied director
the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes
it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to himself
then raising his voice hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something
there is evidently a mistake here
there are thirty six of you in five or six small rooms
there are three of us here and we have room for sixty
there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours
give me back my house you are at home here
on the following day the thirty six patients were installed in the bishop 's palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital
m
muriel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution
his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage
m
muriel received from the state in his quality of bishops salary of fifteen thousand francs
on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m
muriel settled on the disposition of this sum once for all in the following manner
we transcribe here a note made by his own hand note on the regulation of my household expenses
for the little seminary
livres society of the mission
for the lazarists of montdidier
seminary for foreign missions in paris
congregation of the holy spirit
religious establishments of the holy land
charitable maternity societies
extra for that of arles
work for the amelioration of prisons
work for the relief and delivery of prisoners
to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the diocese
public granary of the hautes alpes
congregation of the ladies off of manosque and of sisteron for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls
for the poor
my personal expenses
total
m
muriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied these word as has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptist one
this holy woman regarded monseigneur off as a tone and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church
she simply loved and generated him
when he spoke she vowed when he acted she yielded her adherence
their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little
it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptist one made fifteen hundred francs a year
on these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted
and when a village curate came for the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptist one
one day after he had been ind about three months the bishop said and still i am quite cramped with it all
i should think so
exclaimed madame magloire
monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese
it was customary for bishops in former days
hold
cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire
and he made his demand
some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consideration and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading allowance tom
the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brumaire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town off wrote tom
bigot dept same neu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines expenses of carriage
what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants
expenses of journeys
what is the use of these trips in the first place
next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts
there are no roads
no one travels otherwise than on horseback
even the bridge between durance and chateau arnoux can barely support is teams
these priests are all this greedy and avaricious
this man played the good priest when he first came
now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a posting chaise he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days
on all this priesthood
things will not go well m
le comte until the emperor has freed us from these black capped rascals
down with the pope
matters were getting embroiled with rome
for my part i am for caesar alone
etc.
etc.
on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire
good said she to mademoiselle baptist one monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with himself after all
he has regulated all his charities
no where are three thousand francs for us
at last
that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms expenses of carriage and circuit
for furnishing meat soup to the patients in the hospital
livres for the maternity charitable society of aix
for the maternity charitable society of draguignan
for foundlings
for orphans
total
such wash
muriel 's budget
as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage ban 's dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc.
the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy
after a time offerings of money flowed in
those who had and those who lacked knocked atm
muriel 's door the latter in search of the aims which the former came to deposit
in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress
considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities
far from it
as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received
it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any
then he stripped himself
the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letter 's the poor people of the countryside had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenom end of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome
we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to make him
moreover this appellation pleased him
i like that name said he
bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur
we do not claim that the portrait here with presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original
chapter iii a hard bishopric for a good bishop the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had converted his carriage into alms

there are very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen thirty two curacies forty one vicar ships and two hundred and eighty five auxiliary chapels
to visit all these is quite a task
the bishop managed to do it
he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted spring cart when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains
the two old women accompanied him
when the trip was too hard for them he went alone
one day he arrived at sends which is an ancient episcopal city
he was mounted on an ass
his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him any other equipage
the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes
some of the citizens were laughing around him
monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i perceive that i shock you
you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ
i have done so from necessity i assure you and not from vanity
in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked rather than preached
he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples
he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district
in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor he said look at the people of briancon
they have conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their meadow shown three days in advance of everyone else
they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined
therefore it is a country which is blessed by god
for a whole century there has not been a single murderer among them
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun
if at the harvest season the father of a family has his son away on service in the army and his daughter sat service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the village men women and children go to the poor man 's field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his brain to his granary
to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devil by a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years
well when the father of a family does the boys go off to seek their fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find husbands
to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said look at those good peasants in the valley of queyras
there are three thousand souls of them
mon dieu
it is like a little republic
neither judge not bailiff is known there
the mayor does everything
he alloys the imposts taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritances without charge pronounced sentences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men
to villages where he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the people of queyras do you know how they manage
he said
since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths can not always support a teacher they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley who make the round of the villages spending a week in this one ten days in that and instruct them
these teachers go to the fairs
i have seen them there
they are to be recognized by the quill pen 's which they wear in the core of their hat
those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning and latin have three pens
but what a disgrace to be ignorant
do like the people of queyras
thus he discourses gravely and paternally in default of examples he invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ
and being convinced himself he was persuasive
chapter iv works corresponding to words his conversation was gay and affable
he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him
when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy
madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur
one day he rose from his arm chair and went to his library in search of a book
this book was on one of the upper shelves
as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it
madame magloire said he fetch me a chair
my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf
one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the expectations of her three sons
she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs
the youngest of the three was to receive from a grandaunt a good hundred thousand livres of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather
the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts
on one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de low as relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations
she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin
what are you thinking about
i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st
augustine ' place your hopes in the man from whom you do not inherit
' at another time on receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the countryside wherein not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page what a stout back death has
he exclaimed
what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much with us then have in order this to press the tomb into the service of vanity
he was gifted on occasion with a gentle raillery which almost always concealed a serious meaning
in the course of one lent a youthful vicar came god and preached in the cathedral
he was tolerably eloquent
the subject of his sermon was charity
he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable
among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of a usurer named m
tenor and who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloths edges and woollen balloons
never in his whole life had m
tenor and bestowed aim so many poor wretch
after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old beggar women at the door of the cathedral
there were six of them to share it
one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m
tenor and purchasing paradise for a sou
when it was a question of charity he was not to be rebuffed even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection
once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room of the town there was present the marquis de champtercier a wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an ultra royalist and an ultra voltairian
this variety of man has actually existed
when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m
le marquis
the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur
give them to me replied the bishop
one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants ' dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand novels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and forty six thousand cabins besides which have but one opening the door
and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows
just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result
alas
god gives air token the law sells it to them
i do not blame the law but i bless god
in the department of the users in the car in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch
that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine
they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried cow dung
in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for twenty four hours in order to render it eatable
my brethren have pity
behold the suffering on all sides of you
born a provencal be easily familiarized himself with the dialect of the south
he said en be
mouse uses sage
asin lower languedoc on team at a class a
as in the basses alpes pierre in bournmouth embrun bourn from agenda season upper dauphine
this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits
he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains
he understood how to say the grandest things in the most vulgar of idioms
as he spoke all tongue she entered into all hearts
moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes
he condemned nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account
he said examine the road over which the fault has passed
being as he described himself with a smile and a sinner he had none of the asperities of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the crown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation
he drags it with him and yields to it
he must watch it check it repressor and obey it only at the last extremity
there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault this committee is denial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer
to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule
err falls in if you will but be upright
the least possible sin is the law of man
now install is the dream of the angel
all which is terrestrial is subject to win
sinisa gravitation
when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and growing angry very quickly oh
oh
he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits
these are hypocrisies which have taken bright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter
he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest
he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husband 's the father 's the master 's the strong the rich and the wise
he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces
this soul is full of shadows in is there uncommitted
the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel
one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and on the point of trial discussed in a drawing room
a wretched man being at the end of his resources has coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her
counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch
the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man
she was held but there were no proofs except against her
she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession
she denied they insisted
she persisted in her denial
thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown
he invented an infidelity on the part of the lover and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was receiving her
thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all
the man was ruined
he was shortly to be true data is with his accomplice
they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate
by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath get a reduced the justice of revenge
the bishop listened to all this in silence
when they had finished he inquired where are this man and woman to be tried
at the court of assizes
he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried
a tragic event occurred at da man was condemned to death for murder
he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been a mountebank affairs and a writer for the public
the town took a great interest in the trial
on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill
a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments
they sent for the cure
it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine
i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mountebank i too am i 'll and besides it is not my place
this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right it is not his place it is mine
he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mountebank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to him
he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own
he told him the best truths which are also the most simple
he was rather brother friend he was bishop only to bless
he taught him everything encouraged and consoles him
the man was on the point of dying in despair
death was an abyss to him
as he stood trembling on its mournful brink here soiled with horror
he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent
his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call life
he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and be held only darkness
the bishop made him 's delight
on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there
he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd in his purple ca mail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords
he mounted the tumbril with him he mounted the scaffold with him
the sufferer who had been so gloomy and cast down on the preceding day was radiant
he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god
the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him god raised from the dead him whom manslau she whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more
pray believe enter into life the father is there
when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw a side to let him pass
they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor of his serenity
on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifical ly
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation
this however was a remark which was confined to the drawing rooms
the populace which perceives honest in holy deeds was touched and admired him
as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it
in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepared it has something about it which produces hallucination
one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing upon it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one 's own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against
some admire it like we maistre others exec rate it like beccaria
the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called find icts it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral
he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers
all social problems erect their interrogation point around this shopping knife
the scaffold is a vision
the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords
it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of carpenter 's work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cores were possessed of will
in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guide and as though taking part in what is going on
the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it dev our site are flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenters spectre which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed
the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had disappeared the phantom of social justice tormented him
he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself
at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice
this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved i did not think that it was so monstrous
it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law
death belongs to god alone
by what right women touch that unknown thing
in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished
nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution
m
muriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying
he did not ignore the fact that there inlay his greatest duty and his greatest labor
widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord
he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child
as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech
oh admirable console r
he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignity it by hope
he said have a care of the manner in which you turn towards the dead
think not of that which perishes
gaze steadily
you will perceive the living light of your wellbeloved dead in the depths of heaven
he knew that faith is wholesome
he sought to counsel and calm the despairing man by pointing out to him there signed man and to transform the grief which gazed upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes it 's gaze upon a star
chapter v monseigneur bienvenu made his cassocks last too long the private life of m
muriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life
the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of 'd lived would have been a solemn and charming sight for anyone who could have viewed it close at hand
like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little
this brief slumber was profound
in the morning he hesitated for an hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house
his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows
then he set to work
a bishop is a very busy man he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his vicar 's general
he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine prayer books diocesan catechisms books of hours etc.
charges to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state on the other the holy see and a thousand matters of business
what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the necessitous the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the necessitous he devoted to work
sometimes he dug in his garden again he read or write
he had but one word for both these kinds of toil he called them gardening
the mind is a garden said he
towards mid day when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings
he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long came clad in his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large billion to droop from its three points
it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared
one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it
the children and the old people came out to the door steps for the bishop as for the sun
he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him
they pointed out his house to anyone who was in need of anything
illustration the comfort orb comfort or here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled upon the mothers
he visited the poor so long as he had any money when he no longer had any he visited the rich
as he made his cassocks last along while and did not wish to have it noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak
this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer
on his return be fined
the dinner resembled his breakfast
at half past eight in the evening he 's upper with his sister madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table
nothing could be more frugal than this repast
if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains
every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal the bishop did not interfere
with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil soup
thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the sheer of acute he indulged in the sheer of a trappist
after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptist one and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio
he was a man of letters and rather learned
he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated up on the waters
with this verse he compares three tests the arabic verse which says the winds of god blew flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chaldaic paraphrase of onkelos which renders it a wind coming from god blew up on the face of the waters
in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemais great granduncle to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century under the pseudonym of barley court
sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself
these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them
we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton cornwallis and the admiral 's on the american station
versailles poinsot bookseller and paris pics of bookseller quai des augustine
here is the note on you who are
ecclesiastes calls you the all powerful the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch calls you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you godman calls you father but solomon calls you compassion and that is the most beautiful of all your names
toward nine o'clock in the evening the two women retired and he took themselves to their chambers on the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor
it is necessary that we should in this place give an exact idea of the dwelling of the bishop of d chapter vi who guarded his house for him the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of a ground floor and one story above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above
behind the house was a gardens quarter of an acre in extent
the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below
the first room opening on the street served him as dining room the second was his bedroom and the third his oratory
there was no exit possible from this oratory except by passing through the bedroom not from the bedroom without passing through the dining room
at the end of the suite in the oratory there was a detached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality
the bishop offered this bed to country curated whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought for the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added to the house and abutted on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar
in addition to this there was in the gardens stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in which the bishop kept two cows
no matter what the quantity of milk they gave me invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital
i am paying my tithes he said
his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather
as wood is extremely dear at when it upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cowshed
here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he called it his winter salon
in this winter salinas in the dining room there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and four straw seated chairs
in addition to this the dining room was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted link in watercolors
out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white napery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which decorated his oratory
his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of 'd had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for monseigneur 's oratory on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor
the most beautiful of altar she said is the soul of an unhappy creature consoles and thanking god
in his oratory there were two straw or if dieu and there was an armchair also in straw in his bedroom
when by chance he received seven or eight persons at one time the prefect of the general of the staff of the regiment in garrison of several pupils from the little seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable theories key from the oratory and the armchair from the bedroom in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors
a room was dismantled for each new guest
it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop then relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden if it was summer
there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall
mademoiselle baptist one had also in her own room a very large easy chair of wood which had formerly been folded and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture
mademoiselle baptist one 's ambition had been to be able to purchase a set of drawing room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in swan 's neck style with a sofa
but this would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact that she had only been able to pay by forty two france and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by denouncing the idea
however who is there who has attained his ideal
nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishop 's bedchamber
a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the bed a hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serve in the shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the other near the bookcase opening into the dining room
the book case was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire
in the chimney stood a pair of fire dogs of iron ornamented above with two garlanded cases and flutings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the chimneypiece hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background of threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen near the glass door a large table with an inlet and loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table an arm chair of straw in front of the bed apr ledieu borrowed from the oratory
two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed
small gilt inscriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chalk it bishop of saint claude the other the abbe tourteau vicar general of andean be of grandchamp order of citeaux diocese of chartres
when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left them
they were priests and probably donors two reasons for respecting them
all that he knew about these two persons was that they had been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his benefice on the same day theft of april
madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellowed by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe of grandchamp with four wafers
at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it
this seam took the form of a cross
the bishop often called attention to it now delightful that is
he said
all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were whitewashed which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals
however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornamenting the apartment of mademoiselle baptist one as we shall see further on
before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois
hence this decoration
the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw hats in front of all the beds
altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from toptobottom
this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted
he said that takes nothing from the poor
it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forms and a soup ladle which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth
and since we are now painting the bishop of waste was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a great aunt
these candlesticks held two wax candles and usually figured on the bishop 's chimneypiece
when he had anyone to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table
in the bishop 's own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forms and the big spoon every night
but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed
the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in cross form radiating from a tank
another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it
these alleys left behind them foursquare plots rimmed with box
in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and there stood a few fruit trees
madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot
it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets
madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken
the beautiful is as useful as the useful
he added after a pause more so perhaps
this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books
he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming boeing and making holes here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds
he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him
moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between tournefort and the natural method he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus
he did not study plants he loved flowers
he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever failing in these two respects be watered his flower beds every summer evening with a tin wateringpot painted green
the house had not a single door which could be locked
the door of the dining room which as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison
the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch
all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push
at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de 'd had said to them have bolts put on your rooms if that will please you
they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it
madame magloire alone have rights from time to time
as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open
on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note am not ia physician like them
i also have my patients and then took have some whom i call my unfortunates
again he wrote do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you
the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter
it chanced that a worthy sure i know not whether it was the cure of coupoun roux of the cure of pomp kerry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an in discretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of anyone who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some misfortune might occur in a house so little guarded
the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custodiet it domum incanum vigilant quick stock un team unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it
then he spoke of something else
he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons only be added ours must be tranquil
chapter vii cravatte it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show is best what sort of a man the bishop of dead
after the destruction of the band of gaspard new who had invested the gorges of ollioules one of his lieutenants cravatte took refuge in the mountains
he concealed himself for some time with his bandits the remnant of gaspard bee 's troop in the county of nice then he made his way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity of barcelone the
he was first seen at jausiers then at tuiles
he hid himself in the caverns of the jour de l' aigle and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of ubaye and i fayette
he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy
his highway robberies laid waste the countryside
the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain
he always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force
he was a bold wretch
in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived
he was making his circuit to chaste lar
the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps
cravatte was in possession of the mountains as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose
therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort
you do not really mean that monseigneur
exclaimed the mayor
i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour
set out
set out
alone
alone
monseigneur you will not do that
there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years
they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds
they own one boat out of every thirty that they tend
they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain air con little flutes with six holes
they need to be told of the good god now and then
what would they say to a bishop who was afraid
what would they say if i did not go
but the brigands monseigneur
hold said the bishop i must think of that
you are right
i may meet them
they too need to be told of the good god
but monseigneur there is a band of them
a flock of wolves
monsieur lemaire it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd
who knows the ways of providence
they will rob you monseigneur
i have nothing
they will kill you
an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers
bah
to what purpose
on mon dieu
what if you should meet them
i should be gains of them for my poor
do not go monseigneur
in the name of heaven
you are risking your life
monsieur lemaire said the bishop is that really all
i am not in the world to guard my own life but to guard souls
they had to allow him to do as he pleaded
he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide
his obstinacy was bruited about the countryside and caused great consternation
he would take neither his sister not madame magloire
he traversed the mountain on muleback encountered no one and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends the shepherds
he remained there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching exhorting
when the time of his departure approached be resolved to chant a te deum pontifical ly
he mentioned it to the cure
but what was to be done
there were no episcopal ornaments
they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancient chasubles of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace
bah
said the bishop
let us announce our te deum from the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure
things will arrange themselves
they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood
all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly
while they were thus embarrassed a large chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horse men who departed on the instant
the chest was opened it contained scope of cloth of goods mitre ornamented with diamonds an archbishop 's cross a magnificent crosier all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre dame d' embrun
in the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cravatte to monseigneur bienvenu
did not i say that things would come right of themselves
said the bishop
then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate god sends the cope of an archbishop
monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile
go for the devil
the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god
when he returned to chastel at the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity all along the road
at the priest 's house in chaste large rejoined mademoiselle baptist one and madame magloire who were waiting for him and he said to his sister well
sasi in the right
the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns from them with his hands full
i set out bearing only my faith in god i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral
that evening before he went to bed he said again let us never fear robbers not murderers
those are dangers from without petty dangers
let us fear ourselves
prejudices are the real robbers vices are the real murderers
the great dangers lie within ourselves
what matters of what threatens our head of our purse
let us think only of that which threatens our soul
then turning to his sister sister never a precaution on the part of the priest against his fellow man
that which his fellow does god permits
let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that a danger is approaching us
let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account
however such incidents were rare in his life
we relate those of which we know but generally be passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment
one month of his year resembled one hour of his day
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate
stolen they had already been elsewhere
half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor
however we make no assertions on this point
only a rather obscure note was found among the bishop 's papers which may bear some relation to this matter and which is couched in these terms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital
chapter viii philosophy after drinking the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice duty he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest
he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his sons in law his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls
everything else seemed to him very stupid
he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of pinault lebrun
he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchets of that good old fellow the bishop
he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m
muriel himself who listened to him
on some semiofficial occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m
muriel were to dine with the prefect
at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still perfectly dignified exclaimed egad bishop let 's have a discussion
it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking
we are two augurs
i am going to make a confession to you
i have a philosophy of my own
and you are right replied the bishop
as one makes one 's philosophy so one lies on it
you are on the bed of purple senator
the senator was encouraged and went on let us be good fellows
good devil 's even said the bishop
i declare to you continued the senator that the marquis d' arte na pyrrhon hobbes and m
naigeon are no rascals
i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges
like yourself count interposed the bishop
the senator resumed i hate diderot he is an ideologists reclaimed and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire
voltaire made sport of needham and he was wrong for needham 's eels prove that god is useless
a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour paste supplies the fiat lux
suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world
man is the eel
then what is the good of the eternal father
the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop
it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow
down with that great all which torments me
hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace
between you and means in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense
i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity
' tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars
renunciation why
sacrifice to what end
i do not see one wolf immolating himself for the happiness of another wolf
let us stick to nature then
we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy
what is the advantage of being at the top of one sees no further than the end of other people 's noses
let us live merrily
life is all
that man has another future elsewhere on high below anywhere i don't believe not one single word of it
ah
sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the just and the unjust over the gas and the nefac
why
because i shall have to render an account of my actions
when
after death
what a fine dream
after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me
have a handful of dust seized by a shadowy and if you can
let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation
let us seek the real
let us get to the bottom of it
let us go into it thoroughly
what the deuce
let us go to the bottom of it
we must scent out the truthdig in the earth for it and seize it
then it gives you exquisite joys
then you grow strong and you laugh
i am square on the bottom i am
immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for dead men 's shoes
ah
what a charming promise
trust to it if you like
what a fine lot adam has
we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings on our shoulder blades
do come to my assistance is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star
very well
we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars
and then besides we shall see god
ta ta ta
what twaddle all these paradise care
god is a nonsensical monster
i would not say that in the moniteur egad
but i may whisper it among friends
interlock la
to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow
be the dupe of the infinite
i 'm not such a fool
i am a nought
i call myself monsieur le comte bought senator
did i exist before my birth
no
shall i exist after death
no
what am i
a little dust collected in an organism
what am i todo on this earth
the choice rests with me suffer or enjoy
whither will suffering lead me
to nothingness but i shall have suffered
whither will enjoyment lead me
to nothingness but i shall have enjoyed myself
my choice is made
one must eat or be eaten
i shall eat
it is better to be the tooth than the grass
such is my wisdom
after which to whither i push thee the grave digger is there the pantheon for some of us all falls into the great hole
end
finis
total liquidation
this is the vanishing point
death is death believe me
i laugh at the idea of the 're being anyone who has anything to tell me on that subject
fables of nurses bugaboo for children jehovah for men
no our tomorrow is the night
beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness
you have been sardanapalus you have been vincent depaul it makes no difference
that is the truth
then live your life above all things
make use of your i. while you have it
in truth bishop i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own and i have my philosophers
i don't let myself be taken in with that nonsense
of course there must be something for those who are down for the barefooted beggar 's knife grinders and miserable wretches
legends chimeras the soul immortality paradise the stars are provided for them to swallow
they gobble it down
they spread it on their dry bread
he who has nothing else has the good
god
that is the least he can have
i oppose no objection to that but i reserve monsieur naigeon for myself
the good god is good for the populace
the bishop clapped his hands
that 's talking
he exclaimed
what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism
not everyone who wants it can have it
ah
when one does have it one is no longer a dupe one does not stupidly allow one 's self to be exiled like c atom or stone 'd like stephen not burned alive like jeanne d' arc
those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness places sinecures dignities power whether we 'll or ill acquired lucrative recantations useful treacheries savory capitulations of conscience and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished
how agreeable that is
i do not say that with reference to you senator
nevertheless it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you
you great lords have so you say a philosophy of your own and for yourselves which is exquisite refined accessible to the rich alone good for all sauces and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably
this philosophy has been extracted from the depths and unearthed by special seekers
but you are good natured princes and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffles turkey of the poor
chapter ix the brother as depicted by the sister in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of sand of the manner in which those two sainted women subordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instinct seven which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we can not do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptist one to madame the vicomte de de bois chevron the friend of her childhood
this letter is in our possession
d. dec
my good madam not a day passes without our speaking of you
it is our established custom but there is another reason besides
just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper white washed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours
madam magloire has pulled off all the paper
there were things beneath
my drawing room which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and gilded and with beams as in your e
this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital
and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers
but my room is the one you ought to see
madam magloire has discovered under at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable
the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me
in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night
what shall i say to you
i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train
madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole revarnished and my chamber will be a regular museum
she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier tables of ancient fashion
they asked us two crowns of six france each to 're told them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany
i am always very happy
my brother is so good
he gives all he has to the poor and sick
we are very much cramped
the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need
we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed
you see that these are great treats
my brother has ways of his own
when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so
just imagine
the door of our house is never fastened
whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother 's room
he fears nothing even at night
that is his sort of bravery he says
he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him
he exposed himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice it
one must know how to understand him
he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter
here are neither suspicious roads not dangerous encounters nor night
last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers
he would not take us
he was absent for a fortnight
on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfectly well and said this is the way i have been robbed
and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him
when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak except when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me
at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible
now i have ended by getting used to it
i make a sign to madam magloire that she is not to oppose him
he risks himself as he sees fit
i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep
i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me
i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop
it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudences
but now the habit has been acquired
we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep
if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so
after all what is there for us to fear in this house
there is always someone with us who is stronger than we
the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here
this suffices me
my brother has no longer any need of saying a word home
i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence
that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul
i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family
you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist
they really are a very ancient norman family of the general ship of caen
five hundred years ago there was a raoul devaux a jean de faux and a. thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort
the last was guy etienne alexandre and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne
his daughter marie louise married adrien charles de gramont son of the duke louis de gramont peer of france colonel of the french guards and lieutenant general of the army
it is written fausta us and fao usa
good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal
as for your dear sylvanie she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me
she is well works as you would wish and loves me
that is all that i desire
the souvenir which she went through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy
my health is not so very bad and yet i growth in her every day
farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you
a thousand good wishes
baptist one
p
s
your grandnephew is charming
do you know that he will soon be five years old
yesterday he saw someone riding by on horseback who had on kneecaps and he said what has he got on his knees
he is a charming child
his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room like a carriage and saying hi
as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to mould themselves to the bishop 's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself
the bishop off in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact
they trembled but they let him alone
sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards
they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon
at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house
they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared
they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain dates may be put under constraint
thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him
they confided him to god
moreover baptist one said as we have just read that her brother 's end would prove her own
madame magloire did not say this but she knew it
chapter x. the bishop in the presence of an unknown light at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding page she did a thing which of the whole town was to be believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits
in the country heard a man lived quite alone
this man we will stare at once was a former member of the convention
his name was g member of the convention g was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of da member of the convention can you imagine such a thing
that existed from the time when people called each other thou and when they said citizen
this man was almost a monster
he had not voted for the death of the king but almost
he was a quasi regicide
he had been a terrible man
how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost 's court on the return of the legitimate princes
they need not have cut off his head if you please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for life
an example in short etc.
besides he was an atheist like all the rest of those people
gossip of the geese about the culture
was ga culture after all
yes if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his
as he had not voted for the death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and had been able to remain in france
he dwelt at a distance of three quarters of an hour from the city far from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild valley no one knew exactly where
he had there it was said a sort of field while a pair
there were no neighbors not even passersby
since he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass
the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman
nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a soul yonder which is lonely
and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit
but let us a visit this idea which seemed natural at the first blush appeared to him after a moment 's reflection as strange impossible and almost repulsive
for at bottom he shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement
still should the scan of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil
no
but what a sheep
the good bishop was perplexed
sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned
finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd who served the member of the convention in his novel had come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live overnight
thank god
some added
the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out
the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot
with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was near the lair
he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead boughs entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the wasteland and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern
it was a very low but poor small and clean with a fine nailed against the outside
near the door in an old wheelchair the arm chair of the peasants there was a white haired man smiling at the sun
near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd law
he was offering the old man a jar of milk
while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke thank you he said i need nothing
and his smile quitted the sun to rest upon the child
the bishop stepped forward
at the sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life
this is the first time since i have been here said he that anyone has entered here
who are you sir
the bishop answered my name is bienvenu muriel
bienvenu muriel
i have heard that name
are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome
i am
the old man resumed with a half smile in that case you are my bishop
something of that sort
enter air
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
the bishop confined himself to the remark i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed
you certainly do not seem to me to be ill
monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover
he paused and then said i shall die three hours hence
then he continued i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws on
yesterday only my feet were sold today the chill has ascended to my knees now i feel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart i shall stop
the sun is beautiful is it not
i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things
you can talk to me it does not fatigue me
you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death
it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment
one has one 's caprices i should have liked to last until the dawn but i know that i shall hardly live three hours
it will be might then
what does it matter after all
dying is a simple affair
one has no need of the light for that
so be it
i shall die by starlight
the old man turned to the shepherd law go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired
the child entered the hut
the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself i shall die while he sleeps
the two slumbers may be good neighbors
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been
he did not think be discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the whole for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like there 's the who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen
he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him
this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a mood to be severe
meanwhile the member of the convention had been surveying him with a modest cordiality in which one could have distinguished possibly that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dust
the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his conscience as a matter of reproach in connection with any other man
a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even if the law of charity
f calm his body almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarians who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist
the revolution had many of these men proportioned to the epoch
in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof
though so near to his end he preserved all the gestures of health
in his clear glance in his firm to be in the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to disconcert death
azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door
g seemed to be dying because he willed it so
there was freedom in his agony
his legs alone were motionless
it was there that the shadows held him fast
his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light
gay this solemn moment resembled the king in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below
there was a stone there
the bishop sat down
the exordium was abrupt
i congratulate you said he in the tone which one uses for a reprimand
you did not vote for the death of the king after all
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
he replied
the smile had quite disappeared from his face
do not congratulate me too much air
i did vote for the death of the tyrant
it was the tone of austerity answering the tone of severity
what do you mean to say
resumed the bishop
i mean to say that man has a tyrant ignorance
i voted for the death of that tyrant
that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority rightly understood
man should be governed only by science
and conscience added the bishop
it is the same thing
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this language which was very new to him
the member of the convention resumed so far as louis xvi
was concerned i said ' no
' i did not think that i had the right to kill a man but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil
i voted the end of the tyrant that is to say the end of prostitution for woman the end of slavery forman the end of night for the child
in voting for the republic i voted for that
i voted for fraternity concord the dawn
i have aided in the overthrow of prejudices and errors
the crumbling a way of prejudices and errors cause slight
we have caused the fall of the old world and the old world that case of miseries has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy
mixed you said the bishop
you may say troubled joy and today after that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared
alas
the work was incomplete i admit we demolished the ancient regime in deeds we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas
to destroy abuses is not sufficient customs must be modified
the mill is there no longer the wind is still there
you have demolished
it may be of use to demolish but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath
right has it 's wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress
in any case and in spite of whatever may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
incomplete it may be but sublime
it set free all the unknown social quantities it softened spirits it calmed appeased enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth
it was a good thing
the french revolution is the consecration of humanity
the bishop could not refrain from murmuring yes
'
the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation ah there you go '
i was expecting that word
a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst
you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something within him had suffered extinction
nevertheless he put a good face on the matter
he replied the judge speaks in the name of justice the priest speaks in the name of pity which is nothing but a more lofty justice
a thunderbolt should commit no error
and he added regarding the member of the convention steadily the whole louis xvii
the convention art stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishop 's arm
louis xvii
let us see
for whom do you mourn
is it for the innocent child
very good in that case i mourn with you
is it for the royal child
i demand time for reflection
time the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place degreve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv
an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv
monsieur said the bishop i like not this conjunction of names
cartouche
louis xv
to which of the two do you object
a momentary silence ensued
the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken
the convention art resumed at monsieur priest you love not the cruelties of the true
christ loved them
he seized a rod and cleared out the temple
his scourge full of lightnings was a harsh speaker of truths
when he cried 's in its par bulls ' he made no distinction between the little children
it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod
innocence monsieur is its own crown
innocence has no need to be a highness
it is as augustine areas in fleurs de lys
that is true said the bishop in a low voice
i persist continued the convention ar yr you have mentioned louis xvii
home
let us come to an understanding
shall we weep for all the innocent all martyrs all children the lowly as well as the exalted
i agree to that
but in that case as i have told you we must go back further than ' and our tears must begin before louis xvii
i will weep with you over the children of kings provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people
i weep for all said the bishop
equally
exclaimed convention art band of the balance must incline let it be on the side of the people
they have been suffering longer
another silence ensued
the convention art was the first to break it
he raised himself on one elbow took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanically when one interrogated and judges and appealed to the bishop with a gaze full of all the forces of the death agony
it was almost an explosion
yes sir the people have been suffering a long while
and hold
that is not all either why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii
i know you not
ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and seeing no one but that child who helps me
your name has reached me in a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced i must admit but that signifies nothing clever men have so many ways of imposing on that honest goodman the people
by the way i did not hear the sound of your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the form of the roads no doubt
i do not know you i tell you
you have told me that you are the bishop but that affords me no information as to your moral personality
in short i repeat my question
who are you
you are a bishop that is to say a prince of the church one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues who have vast prebends the bishopric of d fifteen thousand francs settled in some ten thousand in perquisites total twenty five thousand francs who have kitchens who have liveries who make good cheer who eat moorhens on friday who strut about a packet before a lackey behind in a gala coach and who have palaces and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot
you are a prelate revenues palace horses servants good table all the sensualities of life you have this like the rest and like the rest you enjoy it it is well but this says either too much or too little this does not enlighten me up on the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom home
to whom do i speak
who are you
the bishop hung his head and replied ver museum i am a worm
a work of the earth in a carriage
growled the convention art
it was the convention art 's turn to be arrogant and the bishop 's to be humble
the bishop resumed mildly so belts or
but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder how my good table and the moorhens which i eat on friday how my twenty five thousand francs income how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty and that ' was not inexorable
the convention art passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away a cloud
before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me
i have just committed a wrong dir
you are at my house you are my guest i owe you courtesy
you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments
your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them
i promise you to make no use of them in the future
i thank you said the bishop
g resumes
let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me
where were we
what were you saying home
that ' was inexorable
inexorable yes said the bishop
what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine
what think you of bossuet changing the te deum over the dragon hades
the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel
the bishop quivered under it noreply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bosquet
the best of minds will have their fetishes and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic
the convention art began to pant the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breath 's interrupted his voice still there was a perfect lucidity of soul in his eyes
he went on let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing
apart from the revolution which taken as a whole is an immense human affirmation ' is alas
a rejoinder
you think it inexorable sir but what of the whole monarchy air
carrier is a bandit but what name do you give to montrevel
fouquier rainville is a rascal but what is your opinion as to lamoignon baville
maillard is terrible but saul chavannes if you please
duchene senior is ferocious but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier
jourdan coupe here is a monster but not so great zoneadm
the marquis de louvois
sure if i am sorry for marie antoinette archduchess and queen but i am also sorry for that poor huguenot woman who in under louis the great sir while with a nursing infant was bound named to the waist to a stake and the child kept at a distance her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish the little one hungry and pale be held that breast and cried and agonized the executioner said to the woman another and a nurse ' abjure
' giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death of her conscience
what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to another
bear this well in kinds of the french revolution had its reasons for existence it 's wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better
from its most terrible blow 's there comes forth a caress for the human race
is bridge is too i have too much the advantage moreover i am dying
and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the convention art concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions
when they are over this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed
the convention art doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost intrenchments of the bishop
one remained however and from this intrenchment the last resource of monseigneur bienvenu 's resistance came forth this reply wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning progress should believe in god
good can not have an impious servitor
he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race
the former representative of the people made no reply
he was seized with a bit of trembling
he looked towards heaven and in his glance at war gathered slowly
when the eyelid was full the year trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plugged in the depths of you
o ideal
thou alone exist est
the bishop experienced an indescribable stock
after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said the infinite is
he is there
if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist
there is the nani
that i of the infinite is god
the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld someone
when he had spoken his eyes closed
the effort had exhausted him
it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him
that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death
the supreme moment was approaching
the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had come from extreme coldness he had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and ice cold hand in his and bent over the dying man
this hour is the hour of god
do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain
the convention art opened his eyes again
a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance
bishop said he with a slowness which probably a rose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my life in meditation study and contemplation
i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs
i obeyed
abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and confessed them
our territory was invaded i defended it france was menaced i offered my breast
i was not rich i am poor
i have been one of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver i dined in dead tree street at twenty two sous
i have succored the oppressed i have comforted the suffering
i tore the cloth from the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country
i have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity
i have when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your profession
and there is at peteghem in flanders at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of urbanists the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in
i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good that i was able
after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed
for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned
and i accept this isolation of hatred without hating anyone myself
now i am eighty six years old i am on the point of death
what is it that you have come to ask of me
your blessing said the bishop
and he knelt down
when the bishop raised his head again the face of the convention art has become august
he had just expired
the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which can not be known to us
he passed the whole night in prayer
on the following morning some bold and curious person 's attempted to speak to him about member of the convention the contented himself with pointing heavenward
from that moment here doubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers
any allusion to that old wretch of an caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation
no one could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did not count for something in his approach to perfection
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coteries
was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop
there was evidently no conversion to be expected
all those revolutionists are backsliders
then why not here
what was there to be seen there
he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil
one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red cap
oh
oh
that 's a coarse color replied the bishop
it is lucky that those who despise it in a cap revere it in a hat
chapter xi a restriction we should incur a great risk of receiving ourselves were we to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop of a patriotic cure
his meeting which may almost be designated as his union with conventions rug left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment which rendered him still more gentle
that is all
although monseigneur bienvenue as far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude
let us then go back a few years
sometime after the elevation of m
muriel to the episcopate the emperor had made him a baron of the empire in company with many other bishops
the arrest of the pope took place as everyone knows on the night of the tutor method july on this occasion m
muriel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris
this synod was held at notre dame and assembled for the first time ont meth of june under the presidency of cardinal beach
m
muriel was one of the ninety five bishops who attended it
but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences
bishop of a mountain diocese living so very close to nature in rusticity and deprivation it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly
he very soon returned to she was interrogated as to this speedy return and he replied i embarrassed them
the outside air penetrated to them through me
i produced on them the effect of an open door
on another occasion he said what would you have
those gentlemen are princes
i am only a poor peasant bishop
the fact is that he displeased them
among other strange things it is said that he chanced to remark one evening when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues what beautiful clocks
what beautiful carpets
what beautiful liveries
they must be a great trouble
i would not have all those superfluities crying incessantly in my ears ' there are people who are hungry
there are people who are sold
there are poor people
there are poor people
' let us remark by the way that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred
this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts
nevertheless in churchmen luxury is wrong except in connection with representations and ceremonies
it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them
an opulent priest is a contradiction
the priest must keep close to the poor
how can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress all these misfortunes and this poverty without having about one 's own person a little of that misery like the dust of labor
is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm
can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace and who has neither a singer hair nor blackened nails not a drop of sweat not a speck of ashes on his face
the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty
this is no doubt what the bishop of 'd thought
it must not be supposed however that he shared what we call the ideas of the century on certain delicate points
he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly pressed it seems that he would have been found to be an ultramontane rather than a gallican
since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline
beginning with behave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations
he refused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days
besides his sister mademoiselle baptist one he had two brothers one a general the others prefect
he wrote to both with tolerable frequency
he was harsh for a time towards the former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape
his correspondence with the other brother the ex prefect a fine worthy man who lived in retirement at paris due cassette remained more affectionate
this monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud
the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions
let there be no mistake as to our meaning we are not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic humane which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect
without going deeply into questions which are only indirectly connected with the subject of this book we will simply say this it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glance had never been for a single instant turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the fictions and the hatreds of this world above the stormy vicissitudes of human things the beaming of those three pure radiances truth justice and charity
while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just buy perilous resistance to the all powerful napoleon
but that which pleases us in people who are rising pleases us less in the case of people who are falling
we only love the fray so long as there is danger and in any case the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last
he who has not been a stubborn accused in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin
the denunciato for success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall
as for us when providence intervenes and strikes we let it work
commenced to disarm us
in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation
and it was a crime to applaud in in the presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head
in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of the bishop of sought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss
with this exception he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence
he was a priest a safe and a man
it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more so perhaps than we who are speaking here
the porter of the town hall had been placed there by the emperor
he was an old noncommissioned officer of the old guard a member of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bonapartist as the eagle
this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches
after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his regimentals as he said so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross
he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon had given him this made a hole and he would not put anything in its place
i will die he said rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart
he liked to scoff aloud st louis xviii
the youth old creature in english gaiters
he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his
he was happy to combine in the same imprecation the two things which he most detected prussia and england
he did it so often that he lost his place
there he was turned out of the house with his wife and children and without bread
the bishop sent for him deprived him gently and appointed him beadle in the cathedral
in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy deeds and gentle manner 's filled the town off with a sort of tender and filial reference
even his conduct towards napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned as it were by the people the good and weakly flock who adored their emperor but loved their bishop
chapter xii the solitude of monseigneur welcome a bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little anne 's just as a general is by a covey of young officers
this is what that charming saint francois de sales calls somewhere les pretres blanca be csc allow priests
every career has its aspirants who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it
there is no power which has not it 's dependents
there is no fortune which has not it 's court
the seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present
every metropolis has its staff of officials
every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary which goes the round and maintains good order in the episcopal palace and mounts guard over monseigneur 's smile
top lease a bishop is equivalent to getting one 's foot in the stirrup for a subdiaconate
it is necessary to walk one 's path discreetly the apostleship does not disdain the canon ship
just as there are bigwigs elsewhere there are big mitres in the church
these are the bishops who stand well at court who are rich well endowed skilful accepted by the world who know how to pray no doubt but who know also how to beg who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy who are abbes rather than priests prelates rather than bishops
happy those who approach them
being persons of influence they create a shower about them upon the assiduous and the favored and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing of large parishes prebends archi diaconate 's chaplaincies and cathedral posts while awaiting episcopal honors
as they advance themselves they cause their satellites to progress also it is a whole solar system on the march
the irradiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite
their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes into nice little promotions
the larger the diocese of the patron the father the curacy for the favorite
and then there is rome
a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal carries you with him as conc lavish you enter a court of papal jurisdiction you receive the pallium and behold
you are an auditor then a papal chamberlain then monsignor and from a grace to an eminence is only a step and between the eminence and the holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot
every skull cap may dream of the tiara
the priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner and what a king
the supreme king
then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary
how many blushing choristers how many youthful abbes bear on their heads perrette 's lot of milk
who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation
in good faith perchance and receiving itself devoted that it is
monseigneur bienvenu poor humble retiring was not accounted among the big mitres
this was plain from the complete absence of young priest 's about him
we have seen that he did not take in paris
not a single future dreamed of engrafting itself on this solitary old man
not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow
his canons and grand vicars were good old men rather vulgar like himself walked up like him in this diocese without exit to a cardinal ship and who resembles their bishop with this difference that they were finished and he was completed
the impossibility of growing great under monseigneur bienvenu was so well understood that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of six or of such and went off in a great hurry
for in short we repeat it men wish to be pushed
a saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor he might communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty an anchylosis of the joints which are useful in advancement and in short more renunciation than you desire and this infectious virtue is avoided
hence the isolation of monseigneur bienvenu
we live in the midst of a gloomy society
success that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption
be it said in passing that success is a very hideous thing
it 's false resemblance to merit receives men
for the masses success has almost the same profile as supremacy
success that menaechmus of talent has one rule history
juvenal and tacitus alone grumble at it
in our data philosophy which is almost official has entered into its service we are the livery of success and performs the service of its antechamber
succeed theory
prosperity argues capacity
win in the lottery and behold
you are a clever man
he who triumphs is generated
be born with a silver spoon in your mouth
everything lies in that
be lucky and you will have all the rest be happy and people will think you great
outside of five or six immense exceptions which compose the splendor of a century contemporary admiration is nothing but shortsighted news
gilding is good
it does no harm to be the first arrival by pure chance so long as you do arrive
the common here is an old narcissus who adores himself and who applauds the vulgar here
that enormous ability by virtue of which one is moses aeschylus dante michaelangelo of napoleon the multitude awards on the spot and by acclamation to whomsoever attains his object in whatsoever it may consist
let a notary transfigure himself into a deputy let a false corneille compose girl date let a eunuch come to possess a harem let a military prudhomme accidentally win the decisive battle of an epoch let an apothecary invent cardboard shoe soles for the army of the sambre and me use and construct for himself out of this cardboard sold as leather four hundred thousand francs of income let a pork packers spouse usury and cause it to bring forth seven or eight millions of which he is the father and of which it is the mother let a preacher become a bishop by force of his nasal crawl let the steward of a fine family be so rich on retiring from service that he is made minister of finances and men call that genius just as they call the face of mousqueton beauty and the mien of claude majesty
with the constellations of space they confound the stars of the abyss which are made in the soft more of the puddle by the feet of ducks
chapter xiii what he believed we are not obliged to sound the bishop off on the score of orthodoxy
in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect
the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word
moreover certain nature 's being given we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own
what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery
these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where would enter naked
the point on which we are certain is that the difficulties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case
no decay is possible to the diamond
he believed to the extent of his powers
credo in patrem he often exclaimed
moreover he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god
the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love
it was in that quarter quiz multum am a bit because he loved much that he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite locutions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry
what was this excess of love
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things
he lived without disdain
he was indulgent towards god 's creation
every man even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals
the bishop of 'd had none of that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless
he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes who knoweth whither the soul of the animal north
hideousness of aspect deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his indignation
he was touched almost softened by them
it seemed as though he went thoughtfully a way to seek beyond the bounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation of the excuse for them
he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties
he examined without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature
this 're very sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings
one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by him suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider
his sister heard him say poor beast
it is not it 's fault
why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness
puerile they may be but these sublime puerilities were peculiar to saint francis d' assisi and of marcus aurelius
one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant
this loved this just man
sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing more venerable possible
monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories agent his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate and possibly a violent man
his universal suavity was less an instinct of nature than the result of a grand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly thought by thought for in a character as in stock there may exist apertures made by drops of water
these hollowware ineffaceable these formations are indestructible
in as we think we have already said he reached his seventy fifth birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty
he was not fall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond of taking longer rolls on foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion
gregory xvi
at the age of eighty held himself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop
monseigneur welcome had what the people terms fine head but so amiable waste that they forgot that it was fine
when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person
his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a man he'sa good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man
that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon
on the first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine man
but if one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiantone experienced something of the emotion which one would feelin be holding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile
respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle
as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion almsgiving the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled every day of his life
filled is exactly the word certainly the bishop 's day was quite full to the brim of good words and good deeds
nevertheless it was not complete if cold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired
it seemed to be a sort of rife with him to prepare himself for slumber by meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens
sometimes if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walls at a very advanced hour of the night
he was there alone communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown
at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take it 's flight from him and something descend into him
mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe
he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity pasta mystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced their way into all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the in comprehensible he gazed upon it
he did not study god he was dazzled by him
he considered those magnificent conjunctions of atoms which communicate aspects to matter reveal forces by verifying them create individualities in unity proportions in extent the innumerable in the infinite and through light produce beauty
these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly hence life and death
he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees
this quarter of an acre so poorly planted so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds was dear to him and satisfied his wants
what more was needed by this old man who divided the leisure of his life where there was so little leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night
was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him to adore god in his most divine works in turn
does not this comprehend all in fact
and what is there left to desire beyond it
a little garden in which to walk and immensity in which to dream
at one 's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked overhead that which one can study and meditate upon some flowers on earth and all the stars in the sky
chapter xiv what he thought one last word
since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop off a certain pantheistic al physiognomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that not one of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort
that which enlightened this man was his heart
his wisdom was made of the light which comes from there
no systems many works
abstruse speculations contain vertigo not here is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypses
the apostle may be daring but the bishop must be timid
he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds
there is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy openings stand yawning there but something tells you you a passerby in life that you must not enter
woe to him who penetrates thither
geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation situated so to speak above all dogmas propose their ideas to god
their prayer audaciously offers discussion
their adoration interrogates
this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs
human meditation has no limits
at his own risk and peril it analyzes and digs deep into its own bedazzlement
one might almost say that by a sort of splendid reaction it with it dazzles nature the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is probable that the contemplators are contemplated
however that maybe there are on earth men who are they men
perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revert the heights of the absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain
monseigneur welcome was one of these men monseigneur welcome was not a genius
he would have feared those sublimities whence some very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity
certainly these powerful reveries have their moral utility and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection
as for him he took the path which shortens the gospel 's
he did not attempt to impart to his chasuble the folds of elijah 's mantle he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events he did not seem to condense inflame the light of things he had nothing of the prophet and nothing of the magician about him
this humble soul loved and that was all
that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is probable but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts saint theresa and saint jerome would be heretics
he inclined towards all that groans and all that expiates
the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound
the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in funding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve
that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation
there are men who toil at extracting gold he rolled at the extraction of pity
universal misery was his mind
the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness
love each other he declared this to be complete desired nothing further and that was the whole of his doctrine
one day that man who believed himself to be a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop just survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit
your love each other is nonsense
well replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself upon it as the pearl in the oyster
thus he shut himself up he lived there he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipices of metaphysics all those profundities which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful somnambulism of the animal the transformation in death the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains the in comprehensible grafting of successive lives on the persistent i. the essence the substance the nile and the end the soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius manoj saint paul dante contemplate with eyes flashing lightning which seems by its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there
monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them and without troubling his own mind with them and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness
book second the fall chapter i. the evening of a day of walking early in the month of october about an hour before sunset a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town off the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stared at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness
it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance
he was a man of medium stature thickset and robust in the prime of life
he might have been forty six or forty eight years old
a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and fanned by sun and wind and dripping with perspiration
his shirt of coarse yellow linen fastened at the neck by a small silver anchor permitted a view of his hairy breast he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the other an old gray tattered blouse patches on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewer on with twine a tightly packed soldier knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand iron shox shoes on his stocking less feet a shaved head and a long beard
the sweat the heat the journey on foot the dust added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole
his hair was closely cutter bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to have been cut for some time
no one knew him
he was evidently only a chance passerby
whence came he
from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance into 'd by the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris
this man must have been walking all day
he seemed very much fatigued
some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gassendi and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade
he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in the marketplace
on arriving at the corner of the rue pouch every he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the town hall
he entered then came out a quarter of an hour later
a gendarme was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants off the proclamation of the gulf juan
the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme
the gendarme without replying to his salute stared attentively at him followed him for awhile with his eyes and then entered the town hall
there then existed at racine inn at the signofthecross of colfax
this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin la barre a major consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another la barre who kept the inn of the three dauphins in grenoble and had served in the guides
at the time of the emperor 's landing many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the three dauphine
it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of good to the citizens
the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had be taken himself to the three dauphine
this glory of the la barre of the three dauphins was reflected upon the la barre of the cross of colfax at a distance office and twenty leagues
it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble
the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the countryside
he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street
all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazed gayly in the fireplace
the host who was also the chief cook was going from one stewpan to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoners whose loud talking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment
anyone who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoners
a fat marmot flanked by white partridges and heather cocks was turning on a long spot before the fire on the stove two huge carps from lake lauzet and a trout from lake all oz were cooking
the most hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said without raising his eyes from his stoves what do you wish air
food and lodging said the man
nothing easier replied the host
at that moment he turned his head took in the traveller 's appearance with a single glance and added by paying for it
the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered i have money
in that case we are at your service said the host
the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire
die in the mountains
the evenings are cold there in october
but as the most went back and forth be scrutinized the traveller
will dinner be ready soon
said the man
immediately replied the landlord
while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worthy host jacquin la barre drew a pencil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window
on the white margin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey
the landlord whispered a word in the scullion 's ear and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town hall
the traveller saw nothing of all this
once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon
immediately responded the host
the child returned
he brought back the paper
the most unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply
he seemed to read it attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment
then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene
i can not receive you sir said he
the man half rose
what
are you afraid that i will not pay you
do you want me to pay you in advance
i have money i tell you
it is not that
what then
you have money yes said the man
and i said the most have no room
the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable
i can not
why
the horses take up all the space
very well
retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of straw
we will see about that after dinner
i can not give you any dinner
this declaration made in a measured but firm to be struck the stranger as grave
he rose
ah
bah
but i am dying of hunger
i have been walking since sunrise
i have travelled twelve leagues
i pay
i wish to eat
i have nothing said the landlord
the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the stoves nothing
and all that
all that is engaged
by whom
by messieurs the wagoners
how many are there of them
twelve
there is enough food there for twenty
they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance
the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am at an inn i am hungry and i shall remain
then the most bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him start go away
at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the iron show tip of his staff he turned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host based steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop
there 's enough of that sort of talk
do you want me to tell you your name
your name is jean valjean
how do you want me to tell you who you are
when i saw you come in. i suspected something i sent to the town hall and this was the reply that was sent to me
can you read
so saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town hall and from the town hall to the inn
the man cast a glance upon it
the landlord resumed after a pause
i am in the habit of being polite to everyone
go away
the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure
he chose the principal street
he walked straight on at a venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man
he did not turn round a single time
had he done so he would have seen the most of the cross of colfax standing on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the passersby in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
he saw nothing of all this
people who are crushed do not look behind them
they know but too well the evil fate which follows them
thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad
all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply
night was drawing near
he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter
the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble public house some novel however lowly
just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets spine branch suspended from across beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight
he proceeded thither
it proved to be in fact a public house
the public house which is in the rue de chat faut
the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the low studded room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth
some men were engaged in drinking there
the landlord was warming himself
an iron pot suspended from a crane bubbled over the flame
the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by two doors
one opens on the street the other upon a small yard filled with manure
the travellers are not enter by the street door
he slipped into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened the door
who goes there
said the master
someone who wants supper and bed
good
we furnish supper and bed here
he entered
all the men who were drinking turned round
the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other
they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack
the host said to him there is the fire
the supper is cooking in the pot
come and warm yourself comrade
he approached and seated himself near the hearth
he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fire a fine odor was emitted by the pot
all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows
it was more over a firm energetic and melancholy profile
this physiognomy was strangely composed it began by seeking humble and ended by seeking severe
the eyes home beneath it slashes like a fire beneath brushwood
one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chat faut had been to stable his horse at la barre 's
it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this unprepossessing stranger on the road between bras d' asse and i have forgotten the name
i think it was esco union
now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had requested him to take him on his crupper to which the fishmonger had made no reply except by redoubling his gait
this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin la barre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter of the morning to the people at the cross of colfax
from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavernkeeper
the tavernkeeper went to him
they exchanged a few words in a low tone
the man had again become absorbed in his reflections
the tavernkeeper returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him you are going to get out of here
the stranger turned round and replied gently am
you know
yes
i was sent away from the other inn
and you are to be turned out of this one
where would you have me go
elsewhere
the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of colfax and who seemed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him
he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick the children dispersed like a flock of birds
he passed before the prison
at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell
he rang
the wicket opened
turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night
a voice replied the prison is not an inn
get yourself arrested and you will be admitted
the wicket closed again
he entered a little street in which there were many gardens
some of them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the street
in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up
he peered through the page as he had done at the public house
within was a large white washed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a double barrelled fun hanging on the wall
a table was spread in the centre of the room
a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter jun shining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking soup tureen
at this tables at a man of about forty with a merry and open countenance who was candling a little child on his knees
close by a very young woman was nursing another child
the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was smiling
the stranger paused a moment in 're very before this tender and calming spectacle
what was taking place within him
he alone could have told
it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps a little pity
he tapped on the page with a very small and feeble knock
they did not hear him
he tapped again
he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that someone is knocking
no replied the husband
he tapped a third time
the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened
he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan
he wore a huge leatherapron which reached to his left shoulder and which a hammer a red handkerchiefs powder horn and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the girdle as in a pocket caused to bulge out
he carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his full neck white and bars
he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a shout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable
pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that she 'd yonder in the garden in which to sleep
tell me can you
for money
who are you
demanded the master of the house
the man replied i have just come from put moisson
i have walked all day long
i have travelled twelve leagues
can you
if i pay
i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me
but why do you not go to the inn
there is no room
bah
impossible
this is neither a fair not a market day
have you been to la barre
yes
well
the traveller replied with embarrassment i do not know
he did not receive me
have you been to what 's his name 's in the rusch affair
the stranger 's embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either
the peasant 's countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder are you the man
he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall
meanwhile at the words are you the man
the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitately behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in a low to get so marquee
all this took place in less time than it requires to picture it to one 's self
after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinizes a viper the master of the house returned to the door and said clearout
for pity 's sake a glass of water said the man
a shot from my gun
said the peasant
then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts
a moment later the window shutter was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
night continued to fall
a cold wind from the alps was blowing
by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens which bordered the streets sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of sods
he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden
he approached the hut it 's door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which road laborers construct for themselves along the roads
he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a road laborer he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was at least a shelter from the cold
this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night
he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut
it was warm there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw
he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so fatigued waste
then as the knapsack on his back was in his way and as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about unbuckling one of the straps
at that moment a ferocious growl became audible
he raised his eyes
the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut
it was a dog 's kennel
he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his tags
he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as larose couverte
when he had not without difficulty re passed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter without a roof over his head chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone and it appears that a passerby heard him exclaim i am not even a dog
he soon rose again and resumed his march
he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter
he walked thus for some time with his head still drooping
when he felt himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed searchingly about him
he was in a field
before him was one of those low hills covered with close cut stubble which after the harvest resemble shaved heads
the horizon was perfectly black
this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky
meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of whitish arch whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth
the earth was thus better lighter than the sky which produces a particularly sinister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and means as outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow
there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer
this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and 're very he turned back abruptly
there are instants when nature seems hostile
he retraced his steps the gates of 'd were closed
d. which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since
he passed through a breach and entered the town again
it might have been eight o'clock in the evening
as he was not acquainted with the streets here commenced his walk at random
in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary
as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church
at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment
it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the imperial guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time
worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office
at that moment an old woman came out of the church
she saw the man stretched out in the shadow
what are you doing there my friend
said she
he answered harshly and angrily as you see my good woman i am sleeping
the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was the marquise de ron this bench
she went on
i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man today i have a mattress of stone
you have been a soldier
yes my good woman a soldier
why do you not go to the inn
because i have no money
alas
said madame der i have only four cousin my purse
give it to me all the same
the man took the four sous
madame de r continued you can not obtain lodgings in an inn for so small a sum
but have you tried
it is impossible for you to pass the night thus
you are cold and hungry no doubt
someone might have given you a lodging out of charity
i have knocked at all doors
well
i have been driven away everywhere
the good woman touched the man 's arm and pointed out to him on the other side of the streets small low house which stood beside the bishop 's palace
you have knocked at all doors
yes
have you knocked at that one
no
knock there
chapter ii prudence counselled to wisdom
that evening the bishop off after his promenade through the town remained shut up rather late in his room
he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately
he was carefully compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject
his book was divided into two parts firstly the duties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the class to which he belongs
the duties of all are the great duties
there are four of these
saint matthew points them out duties towards god matt
vi
duties towards one 's self matt
v
duties towards one 's neighbor matt
vii
duties towards animals matt
vi
as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere to sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to young men by saint peter to husband 's father 's children and servants in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews to virgins in the epistle to the corinthians
out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls
at eight o'clock he was still at work writing with a good deal of inconvenience upon little squares of paper with a big book open on his knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the silverware from the cupboard near his bed
a moment later the bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him why this book rose from his table and entered the dining room
the dining room was an oblong apartment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on the garden
madame magloire was in fact just putting the last touches to the table
as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle baptist one
alamo stood on the table the table was near the fireplace
a wood fire was burning there
one can easily picture to one 's self these two women both of whom were over sixty years of age
madame magloire small plump vivacious mademoiselle baptist one gentle slender trail somewhat taller than her brother dressed in a town of puce colored silk of the fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted ever since
to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptist one that of a lady
madame magloire wore a white quilted caps gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house a very whitefish u putting out from a town of coarse black woollen stuff with large short sleeves an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks knotted round the waist with a green ribbon with a stomacher of the same attached by two pins at the upper corners coarse shoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles
mademoiselle baptist one 's gown was cut on the patterns of with a short waist a narrow sheath like skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons
she concealed her gray hair under a frizz edwin known as the baby wig
madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her a rather crabbed and imperious look
so long as monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like her mistress
mademoiselle baptist one did not even speak
she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him
she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and along arched nose but her whole visage her whole person breathed forth an ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning
she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hope those three virtues which mildly warm the soul had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
nature had made her a lamb religion had made her an angel
poor sainted virgin
sweet memory which has vanished
mademoiselle baptist one has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details
at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity
she was haranguing mademoiselle baptist one on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed
the question concerned the lockup on the entrance door
it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places
people had spoken of a prowler of evil appearances suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into their heads to return home page that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters
the police was very badly organized moreover because there was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure each other by making things happen
it behooves wise people to play the part of their own police and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to duly close bar and barricade their houses and to fasten the doors well
madame magloire emphasized these last words but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold
he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and then fell to thinking of other things
he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire
she repeated it
then mademoiselle baptist one desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother ventured to say timidly did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother
i have heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop
then half turning in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come what is the matter
what is the matter
areas in any great danger
then madame magloire began the whole story a fresh exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact
it appeared that a bohemian a barefooted vagabond a sort of dangerous mendicant was at that moment in the town
he had presented himself at jacquin la barre 's to obtain lodgings but the latter had not been willing to take him in
he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gassendi and roam about the streets in the gloaming
a gallowsbird with a terrible face
really
said the bishop
this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire it seemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed she pursued triumphantly yes monseigneur
that is how it is
there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town tonight
everyone says so
and withal the police is so badly regulated a useful repetition
the idea of living in a mountainous country and not even having lights in the streets at night
one goes out
black as ovens indeed
and i say monseigneur and mademoiselle there days with me i interrupted his sister say nothing
what my brother does is well done
madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will permit i will go and tell paul in his ego is the locksmith to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors we have them and it is only the work of a moment for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a patch by the first passerby and i say that we need bolts monseigneur if only for this night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying ' come in ' and besides even in the middle of the night i mon dieu
there is no need to ask permission
at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door
come in said the bishop
chapter iii the heroism of passive obedience
the door opened
it opened wide with a rapid movement as though someone had given it an energetic and resolute push
a man entered
we already know the man
it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter
he entered advanced a step and halted leaving the door open behind him
he had his knapsack on his shoulders his cudgel in his hands rough audacious weary and violent expression in his eyes
the fire on the hearth lighted him up
he was hideous
it was a sinister apparition
madame magloire had not even the strength to utter a cry
she trembled and stood with her mouth wide open
mademoiselle baptist one turned round be held the man entering and half started up in terror then turning her head by degrees towards the fireplace again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene
the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man
as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired the man tested both hands on his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said in a loud voice see here
my name is jean valjean
i am a convict from the galleys
i have passed nineteen years in the galleys
i was liberated four days ago and am on my way to pontarlier which is my destination
i have been walking for four days since i left toulon
i have travelled a dozen leagues today on foot
this evening when i arrived in these parts i went to an inn and they turned me out because of my yellow passport which i had shown at the town hall
i had to do it
i went to an inn
they said to me 've off ' at both places
no one would take me
i went to the prison the jailer would not admit me
i went into a dog 's kennel the dog bit me and chased me off as though he had been a man
one would have said that he knew who i was
i went into the fields intending to sleep in the open air beneath the stars
there were no stars
i thought it was going to rain and i reentered the town to seek the recess of a doorway
yonder in the square i meant to sleep on a stone bench
a good woman pointed out your house tome and said to me ' knock there
' i have knocked
what is this place
do you keep an inn
i have money savings
one hundred and nine france fifteen sous which learned in the galleys by my labor in the course of nineteen years
i will pay
what is that time
i have money
i am very weary twelve leagues on foot i am very hungry
are you willing that i should remain
madame magloire said the bishop you will set another place
the man advanced three paces and approached the lamp which was on the table
stop he resumed as though he had not quite understood that 's not it
did you hear
i am a galley slaves convict
i come from the galleys
he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper which he unfolded
here 's my passport
yellow as you see
this serves to expel me from every place where i go
will you read it
i know how to read
i learned in the galleys
there is a school there for those who choose to learn
hold this is what they put on this passport ' jean valjean discharged convict native of ' that is nothing to you ' has been nineteen years in the galleys five years for housebreaking and burglary fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions
he is a very dangerous man
' there
everyone has cast me out
are you willing to receive me
is this an inn
will you give me something to eat and a bed
have you a stable
madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove
we have already explained the character of the two women 's obedience
madame magloire retired to execute these orders
the bishop turned to the man
sit down air and warm yourself
we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are sipping
at this point the man suddenly comprehended
the expression of his face up to that time sombre and harsh bore the imprint of stupefaction of doubt of joy and became extraordinary
he began stammering like a crazy man really
what
you will keep me
you do not drive me forth
a convict
you call me sir
you do not address me as thou
' get out of here you do g
' is what people always say home
i felt sure that you would expel me so i told you at once who i am
oh what a good woman that was who directed me higher
i am going to sup
a bed with a mattress and sheets like the rest of the world
a bed
it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed
you actually do not want me to go
you are good people
besides i have money
i will pay well
pardon me monsieur the innkeeper but what is your name
i will pay anything you ask
you are a fine man
you are an innkeeper are you not
i am replied the bishop a priest who lives here
a priest
said the man
oh what a fine priest
then you are not going to demand any money of me
you are the cure are you not
the cure of this big church
well
i am a fool truly
i had not perceived your skull cap
as he spoke he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner replaced his passport in his pocket and seated himself
mademoiselle baptist one based mildly at him
he continued you are humane monsieur le sure you have not scorned me
a good priest is a very good thing
then you do not require me to pay
no. said the bishop keep your money
how much have you
did you not tell me one hundred and nine france
and fifteen sous added the man
one hundred and nine france fifteen sous
and how long did it take you to earn that
nineteen years
nineteen years
the bishop sighed deeply
the man continued i have still the whole of my money
in four days i have spent only twenty five sous which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse
since you are an abbe i will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys
and one day i saw a bishop there
monseigneur is what they call him
he was the bishop of majors at marseilles
he is the cure who ruled over the other cures you understand
pardon me i say that very badly but it is such a far off thing to me
you understand what we are
he said mass in the middle of the valleys on an altar
he had a pointed thing made of gold on his head it glittered in the bright light of midday
we were all ranged in lines on the three sides with cannons with lighted matches facing us
we could not see very well
he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear
that is what a bishop is like
while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wide open
madame magloire returned
she brought a silver form and spoon which she placed on the table
madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire as possible
and turning to his guest the night wind is harsh on the alps
you must be cold air
each time that he uttered the words or in his voice which was so gently grave and polished the man 's face lighted up
monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa
ignominy thirsts for consideration
this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop
madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimneypiece in monseigneur 's bedchamber and placed them lighted on the table
monsieur le cure said the man you are good you do not despise me
you receive me into your house
you light your candles for me
yet i have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate man
the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand
you could not help telling me who you were
this is not my house it is the house of jesus christ
this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name but whether he has a brief
you suffer you are hungry and thirsty you are welcome
and do not thank me do not say that i receive you in my house
no one is at home here except the man who needs a refuge
i say to you who are passing by that you are much more at home here than i am myself
everything here is yours
what need gavel to know your name
besides before you told me you had one which i knew
the man opened his eyes in astonishment
really
you knew what i was called
yes replied the bishop you are called my brother
stop monsieur le cure exclaimed the man
i was very hungry when i entered here but you are so good that i no longer know what has happened to me
the bishop looked at him and said you have suffered much
on the red coat the ball on the ankle a plank to sleep on heat cold took the convicts the thrashings the double chain for nothing the cell for one word even sick and in bed still the chain
dogs dogs are happier
nineteen years
i am fortysix
now there is the yellow passport
that is what it is like
yes resumed the bishop you have come from a very sad place
listen
there will be more joy in heaven over the year bathed face of a repentant dinner than over the white robes of a hundred just men
if you emerge from that sad place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of goodwill and of peace you are more worthy than any one of us
in the meantime madame magloire had served supper soup made with water oil bread and salt a little bacon a bit of mutton find a fresh cheese and a large load of rye bread
she had of her own accord added to the bishop 's ordinary care a bottle of his old mauve swine
the bishop 's face at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures
to table
he cried vivaciously
as was his custom when a stranger supper with him he made them and it on his right
mademoiselle baptist one perfectly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left
the bishop asked a blessing then helped the soup himself according to his custom
the man began to eat with avidity
all at once the bishop said it strikes me there is something missing on this table
madame magloire had in fact only placed the three sets of forms and spoons which were absolutely necessary
now it was the usage of the house when the bishop has anyone to supper to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the tablecloth an innocent ostentation
this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child 's play which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty into dignity
madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word and a moment later the three sets of silver forms and spoons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table
chapter iv details concerning the cheese dairies of pontarlier
now in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table we can not do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle baptist one 's letters to madame bois chevron wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minute news
this man paid no attention to anyone
he ate with the voracity of a starving man
however after supper he said ' monsieur le cure of the good for all this is far too good for me but i must say that the carter 's who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do
' between ourselves the remark rather shocked me
my brother replied ' they are more fatigued than i
' ' n o ' returned the man ' they have more money
you are poor i see that plainly
you can not be even a curate
are you really a cure
a hit the good god were but just you certainly ought to be a cure
' ' the good god is more than just ' said my brother
a moment later he added ' monsieur jean valjean is it to pontarlier that you are going
' ' with my road marked out for me
' i think that is what the man said
then he went on ' i must be on my way by daybreak tomorrow
travelling is hard
if the nights are sold the days are not
' ' you are going to a good country 's aid my brother
' during the revolution my family was ruined
i took refuge in franche context first and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands
my will was good
i found plenty to occupy me
one has only to choose
there are paper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories on a large scale steel mills copperworks twenty iron foundries at least four of which situated at low sat chatillon at aid in court and at heure are tolerably large
' i think i am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned
then he interrupted himself and addressed me ' have we got some relatives in those parts my dear sister
' i replied ' we did have some among others m
deluxe net who was captain of the gates at pontarlier under the old regime
' ' yes ' resumed my brother ' but in ' one had no longer any relatives one had only one 's arms
i worked
they have in the country of pontarlier whither you are going monsieur valjean a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister
it is their cheese dairies which they call fruit is rss
' then my brother while urging the man to eat explained to him with great minuteness what these fruitier es of pontarlier were that they were divided into two classes the big barns which belong to the rich and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer and the associated fruit is rss which belong to the poor these are the peasants of mid mountain who hold their cows in common and share the proceeds
' they engage the services of a cheesemaker whom they call the true in the true in receives the milk of the associated three times a day and marks the quantity in a double tally
it is towards the end of april that the work of the cheese dairies begins it is towards the middle of june that the cheesemakers drive their vows to the mountains
' the man recovered his animation as he ate
my brother made him drink that good mauve swine which he does not drink himself because he says that wine is expensive
my brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted interspersing his words with graceful attentions to me
he recurred frequently to that comfortable tradeoff turin as though he wished the man to understand without advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him a refuge
one thing struck me
this man was what i have told you
well neither during supper nor during the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which could remind the man of what he was not of what my brother was
to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convict so that a mark of the passage might remain behind
this might have appeared to anyone else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body and to bestow upon him some reproach seasoned with moralizing and advice or a little commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future
my brother did not even ask him from what country became not what was his history
for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it
to such a point did he carry it that at one time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pontarlier who exercise a gentle labor near heaven and who he added are happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might sound the man
by dint of reflection i think i have comprehended what was passing in my brother 's heart
he was thinking no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind that the best thing was to divert him from it and to make him believe it only momentarily that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way
is not this indeed to understand charity well
is there not dear madame something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon from moralizing from allusions
and is not the truest pity when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all
it has seemed to me that this might have been my brother 's private thought
in any case what i can say is that if he entertained all these ideas he gave no sign of them from beginning to end even to me he was the same as he is every evening and he 's upper with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m
gedeon leprovost or with the curate of the parish
towards the end when he had reached the first here came a knock at the door
it was mother gerbaud with her little one in her arms
my brother kissed the child on the brow and borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give to mother gerbaud
the man was not paying much need to anything then
he was no longer talking and he seemed very much fatigued
after poor old gerbaud had taken her departure my brother said grace then he turned to the man and said to him ' you must be in great need of your bed
' madame magloire cleared the table very promptly
i understood that we must retire in order to allow this travelled to go to sleep and we both went upstairs
nevertheless i sent madame magloire down a moment later to carry to the man 's bed a goat skin from the black forest which was in my room
the nights are frigid and that keeps one warm
it is a pity that this skin i sold all the hair is falling out
my brother bought it while he was in germany at fort lingen near the sources of the danube as well as the little ivory handled knife which i use at table
madame magloire returned immediately
we said our prayers in the drawing room where we hang up the linen and then we each retired to our own chambers without saying a word to each other
chapter v tranquillity after bidding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his guest and said to him monsieur i will conduct you to your room
the man followed him
as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated or to get out of it it was necessary to traverse the bishop 's bedroom
at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the bed
this was her last care every evening before she went to bed
the bishop installed his guest in the alcove
a fresh white bed had been prepared there
the man set the candle down on a small table
well said the bishop may you pass a good night
tomorrow morning before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows
thanks monsieur l' abbe said the man
hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of a sudden and without transition he made a strange movement which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it
even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment
did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace
was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to himself
he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and bending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice am
really
you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this
he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous have you really reflected well
how do you know that i have not been an assassin
the bishop replied that is the concern of the good god
then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and bestowed his benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head of looking behind him he returned to his bedroom
when the alcove was in use a large serve curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar
the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer
a moment later he was in his garden walking meditating contemplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which god shows at night to the eyes which remain open
as for the man he was actually do fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets
snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep
midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment
a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house
chapter vi jean valjean towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke
jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie
he had not learned to read in his childhood
when he reached man 's estate he became a tree pruner at faverolles
his mother was named jeanne mathieu his father was called jean valjean or via jean probably a sobriquet and a contraction of viola jean here 's jean
jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures
on the whole however there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about jean valjean in appearance at least
he had lost his father and mother at a very early age
his mother had died of a milk fever which had not been properly attended to
his father agree pruner like himself had been killed by a fall from a tree
all that remained to jean valjean was a sister older than himself a widow with seven children boys and girls
this sister had brought up jean valjean and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother
the husband died
the eldest of the seven children was eight years old
the youngest one
jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year
he took the father 's place and in his turn supported the sister who had brought him up
this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlishly on the part of jean valjean
thus his youth had been spent in rude and i 'll paid tool
he had never known a kind woman friend in his native parts
he had not had the time to fall in love
he returned at night weary and ate his broth without uttering a word
his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating a bit of me at a slice of bacon the heart of the cabbage to give to one of her children
as he went on eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soul his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it
there was at faverolles not far from the valjean thatched cottage on the other side of the lane a farmer 's wife named marie claire the valjean children habitually famished sometimes went to borrow from marie claire a pint of milk in their mother 's name which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner snatching the jun from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks
if their mother had known of this marauding she would have punished the delinquents severely
jean valjean gruffly and grumblingly paid marie claire for the pint of milk behind their mother 's back and the children were not punished
in pruning season he earned eighteen sousa day then he hired out as a haymaker as laborer as neatherd on a farm as a drudge
he did whatever he could
his sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children
it was a sad group enveloped in misery which was being gradually annihilated
a very hard winter came
jean had no work
the family had no bread
no bread literally
seven children
one sunday evening maubert isabeau the baker on the church square at faverolles was preparing to go to bed when he heard a violent blow on the heated front of his shop
he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hole made by a blow from a fist through the grating and the glass
the arm seized a loaf of bread and carried it off
isabeau ran out in haste the robber fled at the full speed of his legs
isabeau ran after him and stopped him
the thief had flung away the load but his arm was still bleeding
it was jean valjean
this took place in
jean valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night
he had a gun which he used better than anyone else in the world he was a bit of a poacher and this injured his case
there exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers
the poacher like the smugglers mack 's too strongly of the brigand
nevertheless we will remark cursorily there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns
the poacher lives in the forest the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea
the cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men
the mountain the sea the forest make savage men they develop the fierce side but often without destroying the humane side
jean valjean was pronounced guilty
the terms of the code were explicit
there occur formidable hours in our civilization there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck
what an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummated the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being
jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys
on the dog april the victory of montenotte won by the general in chief of the army of italy whom the message of the directory to the five hundred of the diff l' oreal year iv
calls buonaparte was announced in paris on that same day a great gang of galley slaves was put
