muriel inn
charles francois bienvenu muriel was bishop of she was an old man of about seventy five years of age he has occupied these dogs since
although this detail has no connection whatever with the real substance of what we are about to relate it will not be superfluous it merely for the sake of exactness in all points to mention here the various tumors and remarks which had been in circulation about him from the very moment when he arrived in the diocese
true or false that which is said of men often occupied as important a place in their lives and above all in their destinies as that which they do
m
muriel was the son of a councillor of the parliament of six hence he belonged to the nobility of the bar
it was said that his father de shining him to be the heir of his own lost had married him at a very early age eighteen or twenty in accordance with a custom which is rather widely prevalent in parliamentary families
in spite of this marriage however it was said that charles muriel created a great deal of talk
he was well formed though rather short in stature elegant graceful intelligent the whole of the first portion of his life had been devoted to the world and to gallantry
the revolution came events succeeded each other with precipitation the parliamentary families decimated pursued hunted down were dispersed
m
charles muriel emigrated to italy at the very beginning of the revolution
there his wife died of a malady of the chest from which she had long suffered
he had no children
what took place next in the fate of m
muriel
the ruin of the french society of the olden days the fall of his own family the tragic spectacles of' which were perhaps even more alarming to the emigrants who viewed them from a distance with the magnifying powers of terror did these cause the ideas of renunciation and solitude to terminate in him
waste in the midst of these distractions these affections which absorbed his life suddenly smitten with one of those mysterious and terrible blows which sometimes overwhelm by striking to his heart a man whom public catastrophes would not shake by striking at his existence and his fortune
no one could have told all that was known was that when he returned from italy he was a priest
ibm
muriel was the cure off brig milles
he was already advanced in years and lived in a very retired manner
about the epoch of the coronation some petty affair connected with his curacy just what is not precisely known took him to paris
among other powerful persons to whom he went to solicit aid for his parishioners was j
le cardinal beach
one day when the emperor had come to visit his uncle the worthy sure who was waiting in the anteroom found himself present when his majesty passed
napoleon on finding himself observed with a certain curiosity by this old man turned round and said abruptly who is this good man who is staring at me
site said m
muriel you are looking at a good man and i at a great man
each of us can profit by it
that very evening the emperor asked the cardinal the name of the cure and some time afterwards m
my field as utterly astonished to learn that he had been appointed bishop of'd what truth was there after all in the stories which were invented as to the early portion of m
muriel's life
no one knew
very few families had been acquainted with the muriel family before the revolutio g
m
muriel had to undergo the fate of every newcomer in a little town where there are many mouths which talk and very few heads which think
he was obliged to undergo it although he was a bishop and because he was a bishop
but after all the rumors with which his name was connected were rumors only noise saying swords less than words pal agree as the energetic language of the south expresses it
however that maybe after nine years of episcopal power and of residence in call the stories and subjects of conversation which engross petty towns and petty people at the outset had fallen into profound oblivion
no one would have dared to mention them no one would have dared to recall them
m
muriel had arrived are accompanied by an elderly spinster mademoiselle baptist one who was his sister and ten years his junior
their only domestic was a female servant of the same areas mademoiselle baptist une and named madame magloire who after having been the servant of m
le cure now assumed the double title of maid to mademoiselle and housekeeper to monseigneur
mademoiselle baptist one was a long pale thin gentle creatures he realized the ideal expressed by the word respectable for it seems that a woman must needs be another in order to be venerable
she had never been pretty her whole life which had been nothing but a succession of holy deeds had finally conferred upon her a sort of pallor and transparency and as she advanced in years she had acquired what may be called the beauty of goodness
what had been leanne's summer youth had become transparency in her maturity and this dial man with allowed the angel to be seen
she was a soul rather than a virgin
her person seemed made of a shadow there was hardly sufficient body to provide for sex a little matter enclosing a light large eyes forever dropping a mere pretext for a soul's remaining on the earth
madame magloire was a little fat white old woman corpulent and bustling always out of breath in the first place because of her activity and in the next because of her asthma
on his arrival m
muriel was installed in the episcopal palace with the honors required by the imperial decrees which class a bishop immediately after a major general
the mayor and the president paid the first call on him and he in turn paid the first call on the general and the perfect
the installation over the town waited to see it's bishop at work
chapter ii m
my girl becomes h
welcome the episcopal palace led adjoins the hospital
the episcopal palace was a huge and beautiful house built of stone at the beginning of the last century by m
henri puget doctor of theology of the faculty of paris anne of si more who had been bishop of sin
this palace was a genuine self morial residence
everything about it had a grand air the apartments of the bishop the drawing rooms the chambers the principal courtyard which was very large with walks encircling it under arcades in the old florentine fashion and gardens planted with magnificent trees
in the dining room along and superb gallery which was situated on the ground floor and opened on the gardens m
henri puget had entertained in state on july my lords charles bru part de genius archbishop princed' embrun antoine de mesh right the capuchin bishop of grasse philippe de vendome grand prior of france abbe of saint honore del' erin's francois de berton de crillon bishop baron de vence cesar des a brands for cal quiet bishops signor of glands brand jeans lan en priest of the oratory preacher in ordinary to the king bishops signor of sends
the portraits of these seven reverend personages decorated this apartment and this memorable date theft of july was there engraved in letters of gold on a table of white marble
the hospital was a low and narrow building of a single story with a small garden
three days after his arrival the bishop visited the hospital
the visit ended he had the director requested to be so good as to come to his house
monsieur the director of the hospital said her omim how many sick people have you at the present moment
twenty six monseigneur
that was the number which i counted as if the bishop
the beds pursued the director are very much crowded against each other
that is what i observed
the halls are nothing but rooms and it is with difficulty that the air can be changed in them
so it seems to me
and then when there is a day of sun the garden is very small for the convalescent a
that was what i said to myself
in case of epidemics we have had the typhus fever this year we had the sweating sickness two years ago and a hundred patients at times we know not what to do
that is the thought which occurred time
what would you have monseigneur
said the director
one must resign one's self
this conversation took place in the gallery dining room on the ground floor
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he turned abruptly to the director of the hospital
monsieur said he how many beds do you think this hall alone would hold
monseigneur's dining room
exclaimed the stupefied director
the bishop cast a glance round the apartment and seemed to be taking measures and calculations with his eyes
it would hold full twenty beds said he as though speaking to himself
then raising his voice hold monsieur the director of the hospital i will tell you something
there is evidently a mistake here
there are thirty six of you in five or six small rooms
there are three of us here and we have room for sixty
there is some mistake i tell you you have my house and i have yours
give me back my house you are at home here
on the following day the thirty six patients were in stalled in the bishop's palace and the bishop was settled in the hospital
m
muriel had no property his family having been ruined by the revolution
his sister was in receipt of a yearly income of five hundred francs which sufficed for her personal wants at the vicarage
m
muriel received from the state in his quality of bishops salary of fifteen thousand francs
on the very day when he took up his abode in the hospital m
muriel settled in the disposition of this du monde for all in the following manner
we transcribe here a note made by his own hand note on the regulation of my household expenses
for the little seminary
livres society of the mission
for the lazarus ts of mont didier
seminary for foreign missions in paris
congregation of the holy spirit
religious establishments of the holy land
charitable maternity societies
extra for that i carles
work for the amelioration of prisons
work for the relief and delivery of prisoners
to liberate fathers of families incarcerated for debt addition to the salary of the poor teachers of the diocese
public granary of the hautes alpes
congregation of the ladies of dogma mosque and of sister on for the gratuitous instruction of poor girls
for the poor
my personal expenses
total
m
muriel made no change in this arrangement during the entire period that he occupied these else as has been seen he called it regulating his household expenses
this arrangement was accepted with absolute submission by mademoiselle baptist one
this holy woman regarded monseigneur off as atoms and the same time her brother and her bishop her friend according to the flesh and her superior according to the church
she simply loved and generated him
when he spoke she vowed when he acted she yielded her adherence
their only servant madame magloire grumbled a little
it will be observed that monsieur the bishop had reserved for himself only one thousand livres which added to the pension of mademoiselle baptist one made fifteen hundred francs a year
in these fifteen hundred francs these two old women and the old man subsisted
and when a village duratec am et of the bishop still found means to entertain him thanks to the severe economy of madame magloire and to the intelligent administration of mademoiselle baptist one
one day after he had been ind about three months the bishop said and still i am quite cramped with it all
i should think so
exclaimed made me magloire
monseigneur has not even claimed the allowance which the department owes him for the expense of his carriage in town and for his journeys about the diocese
it was customary for bishops in former days
hold
cried the bishop you are quite right madame magloire
and he made his demand
some time afterwards the general council took this demand under consider ation and voted him an annual sum of three thousand francs under this heading allowance tim
the bishop for expenses of carriage expenses of posting and expenses of pastoral visits
this provoked a great outcry among the local burgesses and a senator of the empire a former member of the council of the five hundred which favored the brim wire and who was provided with a magnificent senatorial office in the vicinity of the town off wrote tom
bigot dept same neu the minister of public worship a very angry and confidential note on the subject from which we extract these authentic lines expenses of carriage
what can be done with it in a town of less than four thousand inhabitants
expenses of journeys
what is the use of these trips in the first place
next how can the posting be accomplished in these mountainous parts
there are no roads
no one travels otherwise than on horseback
even the bridge between durance and chateau arnoux can barely support is teams
these priests are all this greedy and avaricious
this man played the good priest when he first came
now he does like the rest he must have a carriage and a posting chaise he must have luxuries like the bishops of the olden days
on all this priesthood
things will not go well m
le comte until the emperor has freed us from these black capped rascals
down with the pope
matters were getting embroiled with rome
for my part i am for caesar alone
etc.
etc.
on the other hand this affair afforded great delight to madame magloire
good said she to mademoiselle baptist one monseigneur began with other people but he has had to wind up with him as if after all
he has regulated all his charities
no where are three thousand francs for us
at last
that same evening the bishop wrote out and handed to his sister a memorandum conceived in the following terms expenses of carriage and circuit
for furnish in the at soup to the patients in the hospital
livres for the maternity charitable society of aix
for the maternity charitable society of draguignan
for foundling x
for orphans
total
such wash
muriel's budget
as for the chance episcopal perquisites the fees for marriage ban's dispensations private baptisms sermons benedictions of churches or chapels marriages etc.
the bishop levied them on the wealthy with all the more asperity since he bestowed them on the needy
after a time offerings of money flowed in
those who had and those who lacked knocked atm
muriel's door the latter in search of the aims which the former came to deposit
in less than a year the bishop had become the treasurer of all benevolence and the cashier of all those in distress
considerable sums of money passed through his hands but nothing could induce him to make any change whatever in his mode of life or add anything superfluous to his bare necessities
far from it
as there is always more wretchedness below than there is brotherhood above all was given away so to speak before it was received
it was like water on dry soil no matter how much money he received he never had any
then he stripped himself
the usage being that bishops shall announce their baptismal names at the head of their charges and their pastoral letter's the poor people of the countryside had selected with a sort of affectionate instinct among the names and prenom end of their bishop that which had a meaning for them and they never called him anything except monseigneur bienvenu welcome
we will follow their example and will also call him thus when we have occasion to make him
moreover this appellation pleased him
i like that name said he
bienvenu makes up for the monseigneur
we do not claim that the portrait here with presented is probable we confine ourselves to stating that it resembles the original
chapter iii a hard bishopric for a good bishop the bishop did not omit his pastoral visits because he had concerted miscarriage into alms

there are very few plains and a great many mountains hardly any roads as we have just seen thirty two cur acids forty one vicar ships and two hundred and eighty five auxiliary chapels
to visit all these is quite a task
the bishop managed to do it
he went on foot when it was in the neighborhood in a tilted spring cart when it was on the plain and on a donkey in the mountains
the two old women accompanied him
when the trip was too hard for them he went alone
one day he arrived at sends which is an ancient episcopal city
he was mounted on an ass
his purse which was very dry at that moment did not permit him any other equipage
the mayor of the town came to receive him at the gate of the town and watched him dismount from his ass with scandalized eyes
some of the citizens were laughing around him
monsieur the mayor said the bishop and messieurs citizens i perceive that i shock you
you think it very arrogant in a poor priest to ride an animal which was used by jesus christ
i have done so from necessity i assure you and not from vanity
in the course of these trips he was kind and indulgent and talked rather than preached
he never went far in search of his arguments and his examples
he quoted to the inhabitants of one district the example of a neighboring district
in the cantons where they were harsh to the poor he said look at the people of briancon
they have conferred on the poor on widows and orphans the right to have their meadow shown three days in advance of everyone else
they rebuild their houses for them gratuitously when they are ruined
therefore it is a country which is blessed by god
for awhile century there has not been a single murdered among them
in villages which were greedy for profit and harvest he said look at the people of embrun
if at the harvest season the father of a family has hudson away on service in the army and his daughter sat service in the town and if he is ill and incapacitated the cure recommends him to the prayers of the congregation and on sunday after the mass all the inhabitants of the village men women and children go to the poor man's field and do his harvesting for him and carry his straw and his brain to his granary
to families divided by questions of money and inheritance he said look at the mountaineers of devil by a country so wild that the nightingale is not heard there once in fifty years
well when the father of a family does the boys go off to seek their fortunes leaving the property to the girls so that they may find husbands
to the cantons which had a taste for lawsuits and where the farmers ruined themselves in stamped paper he said look at those good peasants in the valley of queue as
there are three thousand souls of them
mon dieu
it is like a little republic
neither judge not bailiff is known there
the may it does everything
he alloys the imposes taxes each person conscientiously judges quarrels for nothing divides inheritances without charge pronounced sentences gratuitously and he is obeyed because he is a just man among simple men
to villages where he found no schoolmaster he quoted once more the peploe of queue as do you know how they manage
he said
since a little country of a dozen or fifteen hearths can not always support a teacher they have schoolmasters who are paid by the whole valley who make the round of the villages spending a week on this one ten days in that and instruct them
these teachers go to the fairs
i have seen them there
they are to be recognized by the quill pen's which they wear in the core of their hat
those who teach reading only have one pen those who teach reading and reckoning have two pens those who teach reading reckoning and latin have three lens
but what a disgrace to be ignorant
do like the people of que gras
thus he discourses gravely and paternally in default of examples he invented parables going directly to the point with few phrases and many images which characteristic formed the real eloquence of jesus christ
and being convinced himself he was persuasive
chapter iv works corresponding to words his conversation was gay and affable
he put himself on a level with the two old women who had passed their lives beside him
when he laughed it was the laugh of a schoolboy
madame magloire liked to call him your grace votre grandeur
one day he rose from his arm chair and went to his library in search of a book
this book was on one of the upper shelves
as the bishop was rather short of stature he could not reach it
madame magloire said he fetch me a chair
my greatness grandeur does not reach as far as that shelf
one of his distant relatives madame la comtesse de lo rarely allowed an opportunity to escape of enumerating in his presence what she designated as the rape stations other three sons
she had numerous relatives who were very old and near to death and of whom her sons were the natural heirs
the youngest of the three was to receive from a grand aunt a good hundred thousand listed of income the second was the heir by entail to the title of the duke his uncle the eldest was to succeed to the peerage of his grandfather
the bishop was accustomed to listen in silence to these innocent and pardonable maternal boasts
on one occasion however he appeared to be more thoughtful than usual while madame de low as relating once again the details of all these inheritances and all these expectations
she interrupted herself impatiently mon dieu cousin
what are you thinking about
i am thinking replied the bishop of a singular remark which is to be found i believe in st
augustine' place your hikes in the man from whom you do not inherit
' at another time of receiving a notification of the decease of a gentleman of the countryside wherein not only the dignities of the dead man but also the feudal and noble qualifications of all his relatives spread over an entire page what a shout back death has
he exclaimed
what a strange burden of titles is cheerfully imposed on him and how much with us then made in order this to press the tomb into the service of vanity
he was gifted on occasion with a gentler will dry which almost always concealed a serious meaning
in the course of one lent a youthful did arcane rod and preached in the cathedral
he was tolerably eloquent
the subject of his sermon was charity
he urged the rich to give to the poor in order to avoid hell which he depicted in the most frightful manner of which he was capable and to win paradise which he represented as charming and desirable
among the audience there was a wealthy retired merchant who was somewhat of auch der named m
tenor and who had amassed two millions in the manufacture of coarse cloths edges and woollen balloons
never in his whole life had m
tenor and bestowed aim so many poor wretch
after the delivery of that sermon it was observed that he gave a sou every sunday to the poor old beggar women at the door of the cathedral
there were six of them to share it
one day the bishop caught sight of him in the act of bestowing this charity and said to his sister with a smile there is m
ne for and purchasing paradise for a sou
when it was a question of charity he was not to be debugged even by a refusal and on such occasions he gave utterance to remarks which induced reflection
once he was begging for the poor in a drawing room of the town there was present the marquis de champ her ciera wealthy and avaricious old man who contrived to be at one and the same time an ultra royalist and an ultra volta irian
this variety of man has actually existed
when the bishop came to him he touched his arm you must give me something m
le marquis
the marquis turned round and answered dryly i have poor people of my own monseigneur
give them to me replied the bishop
one day he preached the following sermon in the cathedral my very dear brethren my good friends there are thirteen hundred and twenty thousand peasants' dwellings in france which have but three openings eighteen hundred and seventeen thousand novels which have but two openings the door and one window and three hundred and forty sixth ou sans cabins besides which have but one opening the door
and this arises from a thing which is called the tax on doors and windows
just put poor families old women and little children in those buildings and behold the fevers and maladies which result
alas
god give same token the law sells it to them
i do not blame the law but unless god
in the department of the users in the car in the two departments of the alpes the hautes and the basses the peasants have not even wheelbarrows they transport their manure on the backs of men they have no candles and they burn resinous sticks and bits of rope dipped in pitch
that is the state of affairs throughout the whole of the hilly country of dauphine
they make bread for six months at one time they bake it with dried cow dung
in the winter they break this bread up with an axe and they soak it for twenty four hours in order to render its stable
my brethren have pity
behold the suffering on all sides of you
born a provencal her well i familiarized himself with the dialect of the south
he said en be
mouse uses sage
asin lower languedoc on transfac pass a
as in the basses alpes pierre info i enjoy them being ou en from agenda season upper dauphine
this pleased the people extremely and contributed not a little to win him access to all spirits
he was perfectly at home in the thatched cottage and in the mountains
he understood how to say the grandest things on the most vulgar of idioms
as he spoke all tongue she entered into all hearts
moreover he was the same towards people of the world and towards the lower classes
he do been had nothing in haste and without taking circumstances into account
he said examine the road over which the fault has passed
being as he described himself with a smile and a sinner he had none of the asps titles of austerity and he professed with a good deal of distinctness and without the crown of the ferociously virtuous a doctrine which may be summed up as follows man has upon him his flesh which is at once his burden and his temptation
he drags it with him and yields to it
he must watch or check it repressor and obey it only at the last extremity
there may be some fault even in this obedience but the fault this committee is denial it is a fall but a fall on the knees which may terminate in prayer
to be a saint is the exception to be an upright man is the rule
err falls in if you will but be upright
the least possible sin is the law of man
now install is the dream of the angel
all which is terrestrial is subject to win
sinisa gravitation
when he saw everyone exclaiming very loudly and grow in gantry very quickly oh
oh
he said with a smile to all appearance this is a great crime which all the world commits
these are hypocrisies which have taken bright and are in haste to make protest and to put themselves under shelter
he was indulgent towards women and poor people on whom the burden of human society rest
he said the faults of women of children of the feeble the indigent and the ignorant are the fault of the husband's the father's the master's the strong the rich and the wise
he said moreover teach those who are ignorant as many things as possible society is culpable in that it does not afford instruction gratis it is responsible for the night which it produces
this soul is full of shadows in is there uncommitted
the guilty one is not the person who has committed the sin but the person who has created the shadow
it will be perceived that he had a peculiar manner of his own of judging things i suspect that he obtained it from the gospel
one day he heard a criminal case which was in preparation and in the point of trial discussed in a drawing room
a wretched man being at the end of his resources has coined counterfeit money out of love for a woman and for the child which he had had by her
counterfeiting was still punishable with death at that epoch
the woman had been arrested in the act of passing the first false piece made by the man
she was held but there were no proofs except against her
she alone could accuse her lover and destroy him by her confession
she denied they insisted
she persisted in her denial
thereupon an idea occurred to the attorney for the crown
he invented an infidelity on the part of the liver and succeeded by means of fragments of letters cunningly presented in persuading the unfortunate woman that she had a rival and that the man was receiving her
thereupon exasperated by jealousy she denounced her lover confessed all proved all
the man was ruined
he was shortly to be true data is with his accomplice
they were relating the matter and each one was expressing enthusiasm over the cleverness of the magistrate
by bringing jealousy into play he had caused the truth to burst forth in wrath get a reduced the justice of revenge
the bishop listened to all this in silence
when they had finished he inquired where are this man and woman to be tried
at the court of assizes
he went on and where will the advocate of the crown be tried
a tragic event occurred at da man was condemned to death for murder
he was a wretched fellow not exactly educated not exactly ignorant who had been amounts bank affairs and a writer for the public
the town took a great interest in the trial
on the eve of the day fixed for the execution of the condemned man the chaplain of the prison fell ill
a priest was needed to attend the criminal in his last moments
they sent for the cure
it seems that he refused to come saying that is no affair of mine
i have nothing to do with that unpleasant task and with that mounts bank i too am i'll and besides it is not my place
this reply was reported to the bishop who said monsieur le cure is right it is not his place it is mine
he went instantly to the prison descended to the cell of the mounts bank called him by name took him by the hand and spoke to tim
he passed the entire day with him forgetful of food and sleep praying to god for the soul of the condemned man and praying the condemned man for his own
he told him the best truths which are also the most simple
he was rather brother friend he was bishop only to bless
he taught him everything encouraged and consoles him
the man was on the point of dying in despair
death was an abyss to him
as he stood trembling on its mournful brink here boiled with horror
he was not sufficiently ignorant to be absolutely indifferent
his condemnation which had been a profound shock had in a manner broken through here and there that wall which separates us from the mystery of things and which we call line
he gazed incessantly beyond this world through these fatal breaches and be held only darkness
the bishop made him sex light
on the following day when they came to fetch the unhappy wretch the bishop was still there
he followed him and exhibited himself to the eyes of the crowd on his purple ca mail and with his episcopal cross upon his neck side by side with the criminal bound with cords
he mounted the humbrol with him he mounted the scaffold with him
the sufferer who had been so gloomy and was grown on the preceding day was radiant
he felt that his soul was reconciled and he hoped in god
the bishop embraced him and at the moment when the knife was about to fall he said to him god raised from the draw him whom man's psyche whom his brothers have rejected finds his father once more
pray believe enter into life the father is there
when he descended from the scaffold there was something in his look which made the people draw a side to let him pass
they did not know which was most worthy of admiration his pallor of his serenity
on his return to the humble dwelling which he designated with a smile as his palace he said to his sister i have just officiated pontifical ly
since the most sublime things are often those which are the least understood there were people in the town who said when commenting on this conduct of the bishop it is affectation
this however was a remark which was confined to the drawing rooms
the populace which perceives honest in holy deeds was touched and admired him
as for the bishop it was a shock to him to have beheld the guillotine and it was a long time before he recovered from it
in fact when the scaffold is there all erected and prepares it has something about it which produces hallucination
one may feel a certain indifference to the death penalty one may refrain from pronouncing join it from saying yes or no so long as one has not seen a guillotine with one's own eyes but if one encounters one of them the shock is violent one is forced to decide and to take part for or against
some admire it like dd maistre others exec rate it like beccaria
the guillotine is the concretion of the law it is called find icts it is not neutral and it does not permit you to remain neutral
he who sees it shivers with the most mysterious of shivers
all social problems erect their interrogation point around this shopping knife
the scaffold is a vision
the scaffold is not a piece of carpentry the scaffold is not a machine the scaffold is not an inert bit of mechanism constructed of wood iron and cords
it seems as though it were a being possessed of i know not what sombre initiative one would say that this piece of carpenter's work saw that this machine heard that this mechanism understood that this wood this iron and these cores were possessed of will
in the frightful meditation into which its presence casts the soul the scaffold appears in terrible guide and as though taking part in what is going on
the scaffold is the accomplice of the executioner it dev our site are flesh it drinks blood the scaffold is a sort of monster fabricated by the judge and the carpenters spectra which seems to live with a horrible vitality composed of all the death which it has inflicted
therefore the impression was terrible and profound on the day following the execution and on many succeeding days the bishop appeared to be crushed
the almost violent serenity of the funereal moment had did appeared the phantom of social justice tormented him
he who generally returned from all his deeds with a radiant satisfaction seemed to be reproaching himself
at times he talked to himself and stammered lugubrious monologues in a low voice
this is one which his sister overheard one evening and preserved i did not think that it was so monstrous
it is wrong to become absorbed in the divine law to such a degree as not to perceive human law
death belongs to god alone
by what right women touch that unknown thing
in course of time these impressions weakened and probably vanished
nevertheless it was observed that the bishop thenceforth avoided passing the place of execution
m
muriel could be summoned at any hour to the bedside of the sick and dying
he did not ignore the fact that there inlay his greatest duty and his greatest labor
widowed and orphaned families had no need to summon him he came of his own accord
he understood how to sit down and hold his peace for long hours beside the man who had lost the wife of his love of the mother who had lost her child
as he knew the moment for silence he knew also the moment for speech
oh admirable console r
he sought not to efface sorrow by forgetfulness but to magnify and dignity it by hope
he said have aware of the manner in which you turn towards the dead
think not of that which perishes
gaze steadily
you will perceive the living light of your well beloved dead in the depths of heaven
he knew that faith is wholesome
he sought to counsel and calm the despairing jan. by pointing out to him there signed man and to transform the grief which gazed upon a grave by showing him the grief which fixes it's gaze upon a star
chapter v monseigneur bienvenu made his cassock's last too long the private life of m
muriel was filled with the same thoughts as his public life
the voluntary poverty in which the bishop of'd lived would have been a solemn and charming sight for anyone who could have viewed it close at hand
like all old men and like the majority of thinkers he slept little
this brief slumber was profound
in the morning he meditated for an hour then he said his mass either at the cathedral or in his own house
his mass said he broke his fast on rye bread dipped in the milk of his own cows
then he set to work
a bishop is a very busy man he must every day receive the secretary of the bishopric who is generally a canon and nearly every day his vicar's general
he has congregations to reprove privileges to grant a whole ecclesiastical library to examine prayer books diocesan catechisms books of hours etc.
charges to write sermons to authorize cures and mayors to reconcile a clerical correspondence an administrative correspondence on one side the state in the other the holy see and a thousand matters of business
what time was left to him after these thousand details of business and his offices and his breviary he bestowed first on the neces sirius the sick and the afflicted the time which was left to him from the afflicted the sick and the neces sirius he devoted to work
sometimes he dug in his garden again he read or write
he had but one word for both these kinds of foil he called them gardening
the mind is a garden said he
towards mid day when the weather was fine he went forth and took a stroll in the country or in town often entering lowly dwellings
he was seen walking alone buried in his own thoughts his eyes cast down supporting himself on his long came clad in his wadded purple garment of silk which was very warm wearing purple stockings inside his coarse shoes and surmounted by a flat hat which allowed three golden tassels of large billion to droop from its three points
it was a perfect festival wherever he appeared
one would have said that his presence had something warming and luminous about it
the children and the old people came out to the doorsteps for the bishop as for the sun
he bestowed his blessing and they blessed him
they pointed out his house to anyone who was in need of anything
illustration the comfort orb comfort or here and there he halted accosted the little boys and girls and smiled upon the mothers
he visited the poor so long as he had any money when he no longer had any he visited the rich
as he made his cassock's last along while and did not wish to have it noticed he never went out in the town without his wadded purple cloak
this inconvenienced him somewhat in summer
on his return be fined
the dinner resembled his breakfast
at half past eight in the evening he's upper with his sister madame magloire standing behind them and serving them at table
nothing could be more frugal than this repast
if however the bishop had one of his cures to supper madame magloire took advantage of the opportunity to serve monseigneur with some excellent fish from the lake or with some fine game from the mountains
every cure furnished the pretext for a good meal the bishop did not interfere
with that exception his ordinary diet consisted only of vegetables boiled in water and oil soup
thus it was said in the town when the bishop does not indulge in the sheer of acute he indulged in the sheer of a trappist
after supper he conversed for half an hour with mademoiselle baptist one and madame magloire then he retired to his own room and set to writing sometimes on loose sheets and again on the margin of some folio
he was a man of letters and rather learned
he left behind him five or six very curious manuscripts among others a dissertation on this verse in genesis in the beginning the spirit of god floated up on the waters
with this verse he compares three tests the arabic verde which says the winds of god goes flavius josephus who says a wind from above was precipitated upon the earth and finally the chakra is paraphrase of on kelis which renders it a wind coming from god blew up on the face of the waters
in another dissertation he examines the theological works of hugo bishop of ptolemaic great grand uncle to the writer of this book and establishes the fact that to this bishop must be attributed the divers little works published during the last century under the pseudonym of barley court
sometimes in the midst of his reading no matter what the book might be which he had in his hand he would suddenly fall into a profound meditation whence he only emerged to write a few lines on the pages of the volume itself
these lines have often no connection whatever with the book which contains them
we now have under our eyes a note written by him on the margin of a quarto entitled correspondence of lord germain with generals clinton cornwallis and the admiral's on the american station
versailles pound of bookseller and paris loss of bookseller quai des augustine
here is the note on you who are
ecclesiastes calls you the all powerful the maccabees call you the creator the epistle to the ephesians calls you liberty baruch walks you immensity the psalms call you wisdom and truth john calls you light the books of kings call you lord exodus calls you providence leviticus sanctity esdras justice the creation calls you godman calls you father but solomon calls you comp as soon and that is the most beautiful of all your james
toward nineo'clock in the evening the two women retired and he took themselves to their chambers on the first floor leaving him alone until morning on the ground floor
it is necessary that we should in this place give an exact idea of the dwelling or the bishop of d chapter vi who guarded his house for him the house in which he lived consisted as we have said of a ground floor and one study above three rooms on the ground floor three chambers on the first and an attic above
behind the house was a gardens quarter of an acre in extent
the two women occupied the first floor the bishop was lodged below
the first room opening on the street served him as dining room the second was his bedroom and the third his oratory
there was no exit possible from this oratory except by passing through the bedroom not from the bedroom without passing through the dining room
at the end of the suite in the oratory there was a detached alcove with a bed for use in cases of hospitality
the bishop offered this bed to country curated whom business or the requirements of their parishes brought for the pharmacy of the hospital a small building which had been added to the house and a butter on the garden had been transformed into a kitchen and cellar
in addition to this there was in the gardens stable which had formerly been the kitchen of the hospital and in which the bishop kept two cows
no matter what the quantity of milk they gave me invariably sent half of it every morning to the sick people in the hospital
i am paying my tithes he said
his bedroom was tolerably large and rather difficult to warm in bad weather
as wood is extremely dear at when it upon the idea of having a compartment of boards constructed in the cows had
here he passed his evenings during seasons of severe cold he called it his winter salon
in this winter salinas in the dining room there was no other furniture than a square table in white wood and find straw seated chairs
in addition to this the dining room was ornamented with an antique sideboard painted link in watercolors
out of a similar sideboard properly draped with white galery and imitation lace the bishop had constructed the altar which record red his oratory
his wealthy penitents and the sainted women of'd had more than once assessed themselves to raise the money for a new altar for monseigneur's oratory on each occasion he had taken the money and had given it to the poor
the most beautiful of altar she said is the soul of an unhappy creature consoles and thanking god
in his oratory there were two straw pro adieu and there was an armchair also in straw in his bedroom
when by chance he received seven or eight persons at one time the prefect of the general of the staff of the regiment in garrison of several pupils from the little seminary the chairs had to be fetched from the winter salon in the stable theories key from the oratory and the armchair from the bedroom in this way as many as eleven chairs could be collected for the visitors
a room was dismantled for each new guest
it sometimes happened that there were twelve in the party the bishop than relieved the embarrassment of the situation by standing in front of the chimney if it was winter or by strolling in the garden of it was summer
there was still another chair in the detached alcove but the straw was half gone from it and it had but three legs so that it was of service only when propped against the wall
mademoiselle baptist one had also in her own room a very large easy chair of wood which had formerly been folded and which was covered with flowered pekin but they had been obliged to hoist this bergere up to the first story through the window as the staircase was too narrow it could not therefore be reckoned among the possibilities in the way of furniture
mademoiselle baptist une's ambition has been to be able to purchase a set of drawing room furniture in yellow utrecht velvet stamped with a rose pattern and with mahogany in swan's neck style with a sofa
but this would have cost five hundred francs at least and in view of the fact that she had only been able to pay by forty two france and ten sous for this purpose in the course of five years she had ended by denouncing the idea
however who is there who has attained his ideal
nothing is more easy to present to the imagination than the bishop's bedchamber
a glazed door opened on the garden opposite this was the bed a hospital bed of iron with a canopy of green serve in the shadow of the bed behind a curtain were the utensils of the toilet which still betrayed the elegant habits of the man of the world there were two doors one near the chimney opening into the oratory the other near the bookcase opening into the dining room
the book case was a large cupboard with glass doors filled with books the chimney was of wood painted to represent marble and habitually without fire
in the chimney stood a pair of bird dogs of iron ornamented above with two garlanded cases and routings which had formerly been silvered with silver leaf which was a sort of episcopal luxury above the chimney piece hung a crucifix of copper with the silver worn off fixed on a background or threadbare velvet in a wooden frame from which the gilding had fallen near the glass doors large table with an inlet and loaded with a confusion of papers and with huge volumes before the table an arm chair of straw in front of the bed apr ie dieu borrowed from the oratory
two portraits in oval frames were fastened to the wall on each side of the bed
small hilton scriptions on the plain surface of the cloth at the side of these figures indicated that the portraits represented one the abbe of chalk it bishop of saint claude the other the abbey our teak vicar general of andean be of grand champ order of coteaux diocese of chartres
when the bishop succeeded to this apartment after the hospital patients he had found these portraits there and had left them
they were priests and probably donors two reasons for respecting them
all that he knew about these two persons was that they had been appointed by the king the one to his bishopric the other to his benefice on the same day theft of april
madame magloire having taken the pictures down to dust the bishop had discovered these particulars written in whitish ink on a little square of paper yellowed by time and attached to the back of the portrait of the abbe or grand champ with four wafers
at his window he had an antique curtain of a coarse woollen stuff which finally became so old that in order to avoid the expense of a new one madame magloire was forced to take a large seam in the very middle of it
this seam took the form of a cross
the bishop often called attention to it now delightful that is
he said
all the rooms in the house without exception those on the ground floor as well as those on the first floor were whitewashed which is a fashion in barracks and hospitals
however in their latter years madame magloire discovered beneath the paper which had been washed over paintings ornament ing the apartment of mademoiselle baptist one as we shall see further on
before becoming a hospital this house had been the ancient parliament house of the bourgeois
hence this decoration
the chambers were paved in red bricks which were washed every week with straw hats in front of all the beds
altogether this dwelling which was attended to by the two women was exquisitely clean from top to bottom
this was the sole luxury which the bishop permitted
he said that takes nothing from the poor
it must be confessed however that he still retained from his former possessions six silver knives and forms and a soup ladle which madame magloire contemplated every day with delight as they glistened splendidly upon the coarse linen cloth
and since we are now painting the bishop of waste was in reality we must add that he had said more than once i find it difficult to renounce eating from silver dishes
to this silverware must be added two large candlesticks of massive silver which he had inherited from a great aunt
these candlesticks held two wax candles and usually figured on the bishop's chimney piece
when he had anyone to dinner madame magloire lighted the two candles and set the candlesticks on the table
in the bishop's own chamber at the head of his bed there was a small cupboard in which madame magloire locked up the six silver knives and forms and the big spoon every night
but it is necessary to add that the key was never removed
the garden which had been rather spoiled by the ugly buildings which we have mentioned was composed of four alleys in cross form radiating from a tank
another walk made the circuit of the garden and skirted the white wall which enclosed it
these alleys left behind them foursquare plots rimmed with box
in three of these madame magloire cultivated vegetables in the fourth the bishop had planted some flowers here and there stood a few fruit trees
madame magloire had once remarked with a sort of gentle malice monseigneur you who turn everything to account have nevertheless one useless plot
it would be better to grow salads there than bouquets
madame magloire retorted the bishop you are mistaken
the beautiful is as useful as the useful
he added after a pause more so perhaps
this plot consisting of three or four beds occupied the bishop almost as much as did his books
he liked to pass an hour or two there trimming boeing and making miles here and there in the earth into which he dropped seeds
he was not as hostile to insects as a gardener could have wished to see him
moreover he made no pretensions to botany he ignored groups and consistency he made not the slightest effort to decide between your nd fort and the natural method he took part neither with the buds against the cotyledons nor with jussieu against linnaeus
he did not study plants he loved flowers
he respected learned men greatly he respected the ignorant still more and without ever falling in these two respects be watered his flower beds every summer evening with a tin watering pot painted green
the house had not a single door which could be locked
the door of the dining room shock as we have said opened directly on the cathedral square had formerly been ornamented with locks and bolts like the door of a prison
the bishop had had all this ironwork removed and this door was never fastened either by night or by day with anything except the latch
all that the first passerby had to do at any hour was to give it a push
at first the two women had been very much tried by this door which was never fastened but monsieur de'd had said to them have bolts put on your roots of that will please you
they had ended by sharing his confidence or by at least acting as though they shared it
madame magloire alone have rights from time to time
as for the bishop his thought can be found explained or at least indicated in the three lines which he wrote on the margin of a bible this is the shade of difference the door of the physician should never be shut the door of the priest should always be open
on another book entitled philosophy of the medical science he had written this other note am not ia physician like them
i also have my patients and then took have some whom i call my unfortunates
again he wrote do not inquire the name of him who asks a shelter of you
the very man who is embarrassed by his name is the one who needs shelter
it chanced that a worthy sure i know not whether it was the cure of soul pub roux of the cure of pomp kerry took it into his head to ask him one day probably at the instigation of madame magloire whether monsieur was sure that he was not committing an in discretion to a certain extent in leaving his door unfastened day and night at the mercy of anyone who should choose to enter and whether in short he did not fear lest some his fortune might occur in a house so little guarded
the bishop touched his shoulder with gentle gravity and said to him nisi dominus custo did not do my mind anim vigilant quick stock un team unless the lord guard the house in vain do they watch who guard it
then he spoke of something else
he was fond of saying there is a bravery of the priest as well as the bravery of a colonel of dragoons only be added ours must be tranquil
chapter vii cravat re it is here that a fact falls naturally into place which we must not omit because it is one of the sort which show is best what sort of a man the bishop of dead
after the destruction of the band of gaspard new who had invested the gorges of oil joules one of his lieutenants cravat he took refuge in the mountains
he concealed himself for some time with his bandits the remnant of gaspard bee's troop in the county of nice then he made his way to piedmont and suddenly reappeared in france in the vicinity of barcelone the
he was first seen at may diets then at guilds
he hid himself in the caverns of the jour del' air is and thence he descended towards the hamlets and villages through the ravines of una gran ru fayette
he even pushed as far as embrun entered the cathedral one night and despoiled the sacristy
his highway robberies laid waste the countryside
the gendarmes were set on his track but in vain
he always escaped sometimes he resisted by main force
he was a bold wretch
in the midst of all this terror the bishop arrived
he was making his circuit to chaste lar
the mayor came to meet him and urged him to retrace his steps
cravat he was in possession of the mountains as far as arche and beyond there was danger even with an escort it merely exposed three or four unfortunate gendarmes to no purpose
therefore said the bishop i intend to go without escort
you do not really mean that monseigneur
exclaimed the mayor
i do mean it so thoroughly that i absolutely refuse any gendarmes and shall set out in an hour
set out
set out
alone
alone
monseigneur you will not do that
there exists yonder in the mountains said the bishop a tiny community no bigger than that which i have not seen for three years
they are my good friends those gentle and honest shepherds
they own one boat out of every thirty that they tend
they make very pretty woollen cords of various colors and they play the mountain air con little flutes with six holes
they need to be told of the good god god and then
what would they say to a bishop who was afraid
what would they say if i did not go
but the brigands monseigneur
hold said the bishop i must think of that
you are right
i may meet them
they too need to be told of the good god
but monseigneur there is a band of them
a flock of wolves
monsieur lemaire it may be that it is of this very flock of wolves that jesus has constituted me the shepherd
who knows the ways of providence
they will rob you monseigneur
i have nothing
they will kill you
an old goodman of a priest who passes along mumbling his prayers
bah
to what purpose
on mon dieu
what if you should meet them
i should be gains of them for my poor
do not go monseigneur
in the name of heaven
you are risking your life
monsieur lemaire said the bishop is that really all
i am not in the world to guard my own life but to guard souls
they had to allow him to do as he pleaded
he set out accompanied only by a child who offered to serve as a guide
his obstinacy was fruited about the countryside and caused great consternation
he would take neither his sister not madame magloire
he traversed the mountain on nile back encountered no one and arrived safe and sound at the residence of his good friends the shepherds
he remained there for a fortnight preaching administering the sacrament teaching exhorting
when the time of his departure approached be resolved to chant a te deum pontifical it
he mentioned it to the cure
but what was to be done
there were no episcopal ornaments
they could only place at his disposal a wretched village sacristy with a few ancients has jboss of threadbare damask adorned with imitation lace
bah
said the bishop
let us announce our te deum from the pulpit nevertheless monsieur le cure
things will arrange themselves
they instituted a search in the churches of the neighborhood
all the magnificence of these humble parishes combined would not have sufficed to clothe the chorister of a cathedral properly
while they were thus embarrassed alayne chest was brought and deposited in the presbytery for the bishop by two unknown horse men who departed on the instant
the chest was opened it contained scope of cloth of goods mitre ornamented with diamonds an archbishop's cross a magnificent crosier all the pontifical vestments which had been stolen a month previously from the treasury of notre damed' embrun
in the chest was a paper on which these words were written from cravat te to monseigneur bienvenu
did not i say that things would come right of themselves
said the bishop
then he added with a smile to him who contents himself with the surplice of a curate god sends the cope of an archbishop
monseigneur murmured the cure throwing back his head with a smile
god of the devil
the bishop looked steadily at the cure and repeated with authority god
when he returned to chaste lar the people came out to stare at him as at a curiosity all along the road
at the priest's house in chaste large rejoined mademoiselle baptist one and madame magloire who were waiting for him and he said to his sister well
sasi in the right
the poor priest went to his poor mountaineers with empty hands and he returns from them with his hands full
i set out bearing only my faith in god i have brought back the treasure of a cathedral
that evening before he went to bed he said again let us never fear robbers not murderers
those are dangers from without petty dangers
let us fear ourselves
prejudices are the real robbers vices are the real murderers
the great dangers lie within ourselves
what matters of what threatens our head of our purse
let us think only of that which threatens our soul
then turning to his sister sister never a precaution on the part of the priest against his fellow man
that which his fellow does god permits
let us confine ourselves to prayer when we think that a danger is approaching us
let us pray not for ourselves but that our brother may not fall into sin on our account
however such incidents were rare in his life
we relate those of which we know but generally be passed his life in doing the same things at the same moment
one month of his year resembled one hour of his day
as to what became of the treasure of the cathedral of embrun we should be embarrassed by any inquiry in that direction
it consisted of very handsome things very tempting things and things which were very well adapted to be stolen for the benefit of the unfortunate
stolen they had already been elsewhere
half of the adventure was completed it only remained to impart a new direction to the theft and to cause it to take a short trip in the direction of the poor
however we make no assertions on this point
only a rather obscure note was found among the bishop's papers which may bear some relation to this matter and which is couched in these terms the question is to decide whether this should be turned over to the cathedral or to the hospital
chapter viii philosophy after drinking the senator above mentioned was a clever man who had made his own way heedless of those things which present obstacles and which are called conscience sworn faith justice city he had marched straight to his goal without once flinching in the line of his advancement and his interest
he was an old attorney softened by success not a bad man by any means who rendered all the small services in his power to his sons his sons in law his relations and even to his friends having wisely seized upon in life good sides good opportunities good windfalls
everything else seemed to him very stupid
he was intelligent and just sufficiently educated to think himself a disciple of epicurus while he was in reality only a product of pinault le brun
he laughed willingly and pleasantly over infinite and eternal things and at the crotchet air that good old fellow the bishop
he even sometimes laughed at him with an amiable authority in the presence of m
muriel himself who listened to him
in some semi official occasion or other i do not recollect what count this senator and m
muriel were to dine with the prefect
at dessert the senator who was slightly exhilarated though still perfectly dignified exclaimed egad bishop let's have a discussion
it is hard for a senator and a bishop to look at each other without winking
we are two augurs
i am going to make a confession to you
i have a philosophy of my own
and you are right replied the bishop
as one makes one's philosophy soon's lies on it
you are on the bed of purple senator
the senator was encouraged and went on let us be good fellows
good devil's even said the bishop
i declare to you continued the senator that the marquisd' arte na our ruin hobbes and m
naive on are no rascals
i have all the philosophers in my library gilded on the edges
like yourself count interposed the bishop
the senator resumed i hate ride to the usa hideo logos have claimed and a revolutionist a believer in god at bottom and more bigoted than voltaire
voltaire made sport of needham and he was wrong for needham's eels prove that god is useless
a drop of vinegar in a spoonful of flour parts supplies the fiat lux
suppose the drop to be larger and the spoonful bigger you have the world
man is the eel
then what is the good of the eternal father
the jehovah hypothesis tires me bishop
it is good for nothing but to produce shallow people whose reasoning is hollow
down with that great all which torments me
hurrah for zero which leaves me in peace
between you and means in order to empty my sack and make confession to my pastor as it behooves me to do i will admit to you that i have good sense
i am not enthusiastic over your jesus who preaches renunciation and sacrifice to the last extremity
' tis the counsel of an avaricious man to beggars
renunciation why
sacrifice to what end
i do not see one wolf ink playing himself for the happiness of another wolf
let us stick to nature then
we are at the top let us have a superior philosophy
what is the advantage of being at the top of one sees no further than the end of other people's noses
let us live merrily
life is all
that man has another future elsewhere on high below anywhere idon't believe not one single word of it
qh
sacrifice and renunciation are recommended to me i must take heed to everything i do i must cudgel my brains over good and evil over the just and the unjust over the gas and the nefac
why
because i shall have to render an account of my actions
when
after death
what a fine dream
after my death it will be a very clever person who can catch me
have a handful of dust seized by a shadowy and if you can
let us tell the truth we who are initiated and who have raised the veil of isis there is no such thing as either good or evil there is vegetation
let us seek the real
let us get to the bottom of it
let us go into it thoroughly
what the deuce
let us go to the bottom of it
we must scent out the truth dug in the earth for it and seize it
then it gives you exquisite joys
then you grow strong and you laugh
i am square on the bottom i am
immortality bishop is a chance a waiting for deadman's shoes
ah
what a charming promise
trust to it if you like
what a fine lot adam has
we are souls and we shall be angels with blue wings on our shoulder blades
do come to my assistance is it not tertullian who says that the blessed shall travel from star to star
very well
we shall be the grasshoppers of the stars
and then besides we shall weenie
ta ta ta
what twaddle all these paradise care
god is a nonsensical monster
is ok or not say that in the moniteur egad
but i may whisper it among friends
interlock la
to sacrifice the world to paradise is to let slip the prey for the shadow
be the dupe of the infinite
i'm not such a fool
i am a bought
i call myself monsieur le comte bought senator
did i exist before my birth
no
shall i exist after death
no
what am i
a little dust collected in an organism
what am i todo on this earth
the choice rests with me suffer or enjoy
whither will suffering lead me
to nothingness but i shall have suffered
whither will enjoyment lead me
to nothingness but i shall have enjoyed myself
my choice is made
one must eat or be eaten
i shall eat
it is better to be the tooth than the grass
such is my wisdom
after which to whither i push thee the grave digger is there the pantheon for some of us all falls into the great golf
end
finis
total liquidation
this is the vanishing point
death is death believe me
i laugh at the idea of the're being anyone who has anything to tell me on that subject
fables of nurses bugaboo for children jehovah for men
no our tomorrow is the night
beyond the tomb there is nothing but equal nothingness
you have been cards n ala lys you have been vincent depaul it makes no difference
that is the truth
then live your life above all things
make use of your i. while you have it
in truth bishop i tell you that i have a philosophy of my own and i have my philosophers
idon't let myself be taken in with that nonsense
of course there must be something for those who are down for the barefooted beggar's knife grinders and miserable wretches
legends chimeras the soul immortality paradise the stars are provided for them to swallow
they bubble it down
they spread it on their dry bread
he who has nothing else has the good
god
that is the least he can have
i oppose no objection to that but i reserve monsieur naive on for myself
the good god is good for the populace
the bishop clapped his hands
that's talking
he exclaimed
what an excellent and really marvellous thing is this materialism
not everyone who wants it can have it
ah
when one does have it one is no longer a dupe one does not stupidly allow one's self to be exiled like c atom or stone'd like stephen got burned alive like jeanned' arc
those who have succeeded in procuring this admirable materialism have the joy of feeling themselves irresponsible and of thinking that they can devour everything without uneasiness places sinecure's dignities power whether well if i'll acquired lucrative recantation's useful treacher is a savory capitulation's of conscience and that they shall enter the tomb with their digestion accomplished
how agreeable that is
i do not say that with reference to you senator
nevertheless it is impossible for me to refrain from congratulating you
you great lords have so you say a philosophy of your own and for yourselves which is exquisite refined accessible to the rich alone good for all sauces and which seasons the voluptuousness of life admirably
this philosophy has been extracted from the depths and unearthed by special seekers
but you are good natured princes and you do not think it a bad thing that belief in the good god should constitute the philosophy of the people very much as the goose stuffed with chestnuts is the truffles turkey of the poor
chapter ix the brother as depicted by the sister in order to furnish an idea of the private establishment of the bishop of sand of the manner in which those two sainted women's kb ordinated their actions their thoughts their feminine instinct seven which are easily alarmed to the habits and purposes of the bishop without his even taking the trouble of speaking in order to explain them we can not do better than transcribe in this place a letter from mademoiselle baptist one to madame the vicomte de de bois chevron the friend of her childhood
this letter is in our possession
d. dec
my good madam not a day passes without our speaking of you
it is our established custom but there is another reason besides
just imagine while washing and dusting the ceilings and walls madam magloire has made some discoveries now our two chambers hung with antique paper white washed over would not discredit a chateau in the style of yours
madam magloire has pulled off all the paper
there were things beneath
my drawing room which contains no furniture and which we use for spreading out the linen after washing is fifteen feet in height eighteen square with a ceiling which was formerly painted and folded and with beams as in your e
this was covered with a cloth while this was the hospital
and the woodwork was of the era of our grandmothers
but my room is the one you ought to see
madam magloire has discovered in der at least ten thicknesses of paper pasted on top some paintings which without being good are very tolerable
the subject is telemachus being knighted by minerva in some gardens the name of which escapes me
in short where the roman ladies repaired on one single night
what shall i say to you
i have romans and roman ladies here occurs an illegible word and the whole train
madam magloire has cleaned it all off this summer she is going to have some small injuries repaired and the whole re varnished and my chamber will be a regular museum
she has also found in a corner of the attic two wooden pier tables of ancient fashion
they asked us two crowns of six france each to're told them but it is much better to give the money to the poor and they are very ugly besides and i should much prefer a round table of mahogany
i am always very happy
my brother is so good
he gives all he has to the poor and sick
we are very much cramped
the country is trying in the winter and we really must do something for those who are in need
we are almost comfortably lighted and warmed
you see that these are great treats
my brother has ways of his own
when he talks he says that a bishop ought to be so
just imagine
the door of our house is never fastened
whoever chooses to enter finds himself at once in my brother's room
he fears nothing even at night
that is his sort of bravery he says
he does not wish me or madame magloire feel any fear for him
he exposed himself to all sorts of dangers and he does not like to have us even seem to notice of
one must know how to understand him
he goes out in the rain he walks in the water he travels in winter
here are neither suspicious roads not dangerous encounters nor night
last year he went quite alone into a country of robbers
he would not take us
he was absent for a fortnight
on his return nothing had happened to him he was thought to be dead but was perfec gly well and said this is the way i have been robbed
and then he opened a trunk full of jewels all the jewels of the cathedral of embrun which the thieves had given him
when he returned on that occasion i could not refrain from scolding him a little taking care however not to speak gcc dot when the carriage was making a noise so that no one might hear me
at first i used to say to myself there are no dangers which will stop him he is terrible
now i have ended by getting used to it
i make a sign up madam magloire that she is not to oppose him
he risks himself as he sees fit
i carry off madam magloire i enter my chamber i pray for him and fall asleep
i am at ease because i know that if anything were to happen to him it would be the end of me
i should go to the good god with my brother and my bishop
it has cost madam magloire more trouble than it did me to accustom herself to what she terms his imprudence s
but now the habit has been acquired
we pray together we tremble together and we fall asleep
if the devil were to enter this house he would be allowed to do so
after all what is there for us to fear in this house
there is always someone with us who is stronger than we
the devil may pass through it but the good god dwells here
this suffices me
my brother has no longer any need of saying a word home
i understand him without his speaking and we abandon ourselves to the care of providence
that is the way one has to do with a man who possesses grandeur of soul
i have interrogated my brother with regard to the information which you desire on the subject of the faux family
you are aware that he knows everything and that he has memories because he is still a very good royalist
they really are a very ancient norman family of the general ship of caen
five hundred years ago there was a raoul decay as jean de faux and a. thomas de faux who were gentlemen and one of whom was a seigneur de rochefort
the last was guy etienne alexandre and was commander of a regiment and something in the light horse of bretagne
his daughter marie louise married adrien charles de gran ont son of the duke louis de gran on tower of france colonel of the french guards and lieutenant general of the army
it is written fausta us and fao usa
good madame recommend us to the prayers of your sainted relative monsieur the cardinal
as for your wear sylvan if she has done well in not wasting the few moments which she passes with you in writing to me
she is well works as you would wish and loves me
that is all that i desire
the souvenir which she went through you reached me safely and it makes me very happy
my health is not so very bad and yet i growth in her every day
farewell my paper is at an end and this forces me to leave you
a thousand good wishes
baptist one
p
s
your grand nephew is charming
do you know that he will soon be five years old
yesterday he saw someone riding by on horseback who had on kneecaps and he said what has he got on his knees
he is a charming child
his little brother is dragging an old broom about the room like a carriage and saying hi
as will be perceived from this letter these two women understood how to mould them selves to the bishop's ways with that special feminine genius which comprehends the man better than he comprehends himself
the bishop off in spite of the gentle and candid air which never deserted him sometimes did things that were grand bold and magnificent without seeming to have even a suspicion of the fact
they trembled but they let him alone
sometimes madame magloire essayed a remonstrance in advance but never at the time nor afterwards
they never interfered with him by so much as a word or sign in any action once entered upon
at certain moments without his having occasion to mention it when he was not even conscious of it himself in all probability so perfect was his simplicity they vaguely felt that he was acting as a bishop then they were nothing more than two shadows in the house
they served him passively and if obedience consisted in disappearing they disappeared
they understood with an admirable delicacy of instinct that certain dates may be put under constraint
thus even when believing him to be in peril they understood i will not say his thought but his nature to such a degree that they no longer watched over him
they confided him to god
moreover baptist one said as we have just read that her brother's end would prove her own
madame magloire did not say this but she knew it
chapter x. the bishop in the presence of an unknown light at an epoch a little later than the date of the letter cited in the preceding page she did a thing which of the whole town was to be believed was even more hazardous than his trip across the mountains infested with bandits
in the country heard a man lived quite alone
this man we will start at once was a former member of the convention
his name was g member of the fondant long was mentioned with a sort of horror in the little world of da member of the convention can you imagine such a thing
that existed from the time when people called each other thou and when they said citizen
this man was almost a monster
he has not voted for the death of the king but almost
he was a quasi regu code
he had been a terrible man
how did it happen that such a man had not been brought before a provost's court on the return of the legitimate princes
they need not have cut off his head if you please clemency must be exercised agreed but a good banishment for life
an example in short etc.
besides he was an atheist like all the rest of those people
gossip of the geese about the culture
was ra culture after all
yes if he were to be judged by the element of ferocity in this solitude of his
as he had not voted for the death of the king he had not been included in the decrees of exile and had been able to remain in france
he dwelt at a distance of three quarters of an hour from the city far from any hamlet far from any road in some hidden turn of a very wild valley no one knew exactly where
he had there it was said a sort of field ago leclair
there were no neighbors not even passersby
since he had dwelt in that valley the path which led thither had disappeared under a growth of grass
the locality was spoken of as though it had been the dwelling of a hangman
nevertheless the bishop meditated on the subject and from time to time he gazed at the horizon at a point where a clump of trees marked the valley of the former member of the convention and he said there is a soul yonder which is lonely
and he added deep in his own mind i owe him a visit
but let us a visit this idea which seemed natural at the first blush appeared to him after a moment's reflection as strange impossible and almost repulsive
for at bottom he shared the general impression and the old member of the convention inspired him without his being clearly conscious of the fact himself with that sentiment which borders on hate and which is so well expressed by the word estrangement
still should the scan of the sheep cause the shepherd to recoil
no
but what a sheep
the good bishop was perplexed
sometimes he set out in that direction then he returned
finally the rumor one day spread through the town that a sort of young shepherd who served the member of the convention in his novel had come in quest of a doctor that the old wretch was dying that paralysis was gaining on him and that he would not live overnight
thank god
some added
the bishop took his staff put on his cloak on account of his too threadbare cassock as we have mentioned and because of the evening breeze which was sure to rise soon and set out
the sun was setting and had almost touched the horizon when the bishop arrived at the excommunicated spot
with a certain beating of the heart he recognized the fact that he was near the lair
he strode over a ditch leaped a hedge made his way through a fence of dead gough's entered a neglected paddock took a few steps with a good deal of boldness and suddenly at the extremity of the wasteland and behind lofty brambles he caught sight of the cavern
it was a very low but poor small and clean with a fine nailed against the outside
near the door in an old wheelchair the arm chair of the peasants there was a white haired man smiling at the sun
near the seated man stood a young boy the shepherd law
he was offering the old man a jar of milk
while the bishop was watching him the old man spoke thank you he said i need nothing
and his smile quitted the sun forest upon the child
the bishop stepped forward
at the sound which he made in walking the old man turned his head and his face expressed the sum total of the surprise which a man can still feel after a long life
this is the first time since i have been here said he that anyone has entered here
who are you sir
the bishop answered my name is bienvenu muriel
bienvenu muriel
i have heard that name
are you the man whom the people call monseigneur welcome
i am
the old man resumed with a half smile in that case you are my bishop
something of that sort
enter air
the member of the convention extended his hand to the bishop but the bishop did not take it
the bishop confined himself to the remark i am pleased to see that i have been misinformed
you certainly do not seem to me to be ill
monsieur replied the old man i am going to recover
he paused and then said i shall die three hours hence
then he continued i am something of a doctor i know in what fashion the last hour draws on
yesterday only my feet were sold today the chill has ascended to my knees now i feel it mounting to my waist when it reaches the heart i shall stop
the sun is beautiful is it not
i had myself wheeled out here to take a last look at things
you can talk to me it does not fatigue me
you have done well to come and look at a man who is on the point of death
it is well that there should be witnesses at that moment
one has one's caprices i should have liked to last until the dawn but i know that i shall hardly live three hours
it will be might then
what does it matter after all
dying is a simple affair
one has no need of the light for that
so be it
i shall die by starlight
the old man turned to the shepherd law go to thy bed thou wert awake all last night thou art tired
the child entered the hut
the old man followed him with his eyes and added as though speaking to himself i shall die while he sleeps
the two slumbers may be good neighbors
the bishop was not touched as it seems that he should have been
he did not think be discerned god in this manner of dying let us say the whole for these petty contradictions of great hearts must be indicated like there's the who on occasion was so fond of laughing at his grace was rather shocked at not being addressed as monseigneur and he was almost tempted to retort citizen
he was assailed by a fancy for peevish familiarity common enough to doctors and priests but which was not habitual with him
this man after all this member of the convention this representative of the people had been one of the powerful ones of the earth for the first time in his life probably the bishop felt in a good to be severe
meanwhile the member of the convention has been surveying him with a modest cordiality on which one could have distinguished possibly that humility which is so fitting when one is on the verge of returning to dish
the bishop on his side although he generally restrained his curiosity which in his opinion bordered on a fault could not refrain from examining the member of the convention with an attention which as it did not have its course in sympathy would have served his son science as a matter of reproach in connection with any other msn
a member of the convention produced on him somewhat the effect of being outside the pale of the law even if the law of charity
f calm history almost upright his voice vibrating was one of those octogenarian's who form the subject of astonishment to the physiologist
the revolution had many of these men proportioned to the epoch
in this old man one was conscious of a man put to the proof
though so near to his end he preserved all the gestures of health
in his clear glance in his firm to be in the robust movement of his shoulders there was something calculated to die concert death
azrael the mohammedan angel of the sepulchre would have turned back and thought that he had mistaken the door
g seemed to be dying because he willed it so
there was freedom in his agony
his legs alone were motionless
it was there that the shadows held him fast
his feet were cold and dead but his head survived with all the power of life and seemed full of light
gay this solemn moment resembled the kind in that tale of the orient who was flesh above and marble below
there was a stone there
the bishop sat down
the exit dium was abrupt
i congratulate you said he in the tone which one uses for a reprimand
you did not vote for the death of the king after all
the old member of the convention did not appear to notice the bitter meaning underlying the words after all
he replied
the smile had quite disappeared from his face
do not congratulate me too much air
i did vote for the death of the tyrant
it was that one of austerity answering the tone of severity
what do you mean to say
resumed the bishop
i mean to say that man has a tyrant ignorance
i voted for the death of that tyrant
that tyrant engendered royalty which is authority falsely understood while science is authority rightly understood
man should be governed only by science
and conscience added the bishop
it is the same thing
conscience is the quantity of innate science which we have within us
monseigneur bienvenu listened in some astonishment to this languages much was very new to him
the member of the convention resumed so far as louis xvi
was concerned i said' no
' i did not think that i had the right to kill a man but i felt it my duty to exterminate evil
i voted the end of the tyrant that is today the end of prostitution for woman the end of slavery forman the end of night for the child
in voting for the republic i voted for that
i voted for fraternity concord the dawn
i have a used in the overthrow of prejudices and errors
the crumbling a way of prejudices and errors cause slight
we have caused the fall of the old world and the old world that case of miseries has become through its upsetting upon the human race an urn of joy
mixed you said the bishop
you may say troubled joy and today after that fatal return of the past which is called joy which has disappeared
alas
the work was incomplete i admit we demolished the ancient regime in deeds we were not able to suppress it entirely in ideas
to destroy abuses is not sufficient customs must be modified
the mill is there no longer the wind is still there
you have demolished
it may be of use to demolish but i distrust a demolition complicated with wrath
right has it's wrath bishop and the wrath of right is an element of progress
in any case and in spite of what feet may be said the french revolution is the most important step of the human race since the advent of christ
incomplete it may be but sublime
it set free all the unknown social quantities it softened spirits in calm esq pleased enlightened it caused the waves of civilization to flow over the earth
it was a good thing
the french revolution is the consecration of humanity
the bishop could not refrain from murmuring yes
'
the member of the convention straightened himself up in his chair with an almost lugubrious solemnity and exclaimed so far as a dying man is capable of exclamation at the de toutl'
i was expecting that word
a cloud had been forming for the space of fifteen hundred years at the end of fifteen hundred years it burst
you are putting the thunderbolt on its trial
the bishop felt without perhaps confessing it that something within him had suffered extinction
nevertheless he put a good face on the matter
he replied the judge speaks in the name of justice the priest speaks in the name of pity which is nothing but a more lofty justice
a thunderbolt should commit no error
and he added regarding the member of the convention steadily the whole louis xvii
the convention qty stretched forth his hand and grasped the bishop's arm
louis xvii
let us see
for whom do you mourn
is it for the innocent child
very good in that case i mourn with you
is it for the royal child
i demand time for reflection
time the brother of cartouche an innocent child who was hung up by the armpits in the place de greve until death ensued for the sole crime of having been the brother of cartouche is no less painful than the grandson of louis xv
an innocent child martyred in the tower of the temple for the sole crime of having been grandson of louis xv
monsieur said the bishop i like not this conjunction of names
cartouche
louis xv
to which of the two do you object
a momentary silence ensued
the bishop almost regretted having come and yet he felt vaguely and strangely shaken
the club fb tionary resumed at monsieur priest you love not the cru duties of the true
christ loved them
he seized a rod and cleared out the temple
his scourge full of lightnings was a harsh speaker of truths
when he cried's in its par bulls' he made no distinction between the little children
it would not have embarrassed him to bring together the dauphin of barabbas and the dauphin of herod
innocence monsieur is its own crown
innocence has no need to be a highness
it is as augustine's gsa sun fleurs de lys
that is true said the bishop in a low voice
i persist continued the convention ar yr you have mentioned louis xvii
home
let us come to an understanding
shall we weep for all the innocent all martyrs all children the lowly as well as the exalted
i agree to that
but in that case as i have told you we must go back further than' and our tears must begin before louis xvii
i will weep with you over the children of kings provided that you will weep with me over the children of the people
i weep for all said the bishop
equally
exclaimed convention art band of the balance must incline let it be on the side of the people
they have been suffering longer
another silence ensued
the convention art was the first to break it
he raised himself on one elbow took a bit of his cheek between his thumb and his forefinger as one does mechanically when one interrogated and judges and appealed to the bishop with's gaze full of all the forces of the death aging
it was almost an explosion
yes sir the people have been suffering a long whois
and hold
that is not all either why have you just questioned me and talked to me about louis xvii
i know you not
ever since i have been in these parts i have dwelt in this enclosure alone never setting foot outside and seeing no one but that child who helps me
your name has reached me in a confused manner it is true and very badly pronounced i must admit but that signifies nothing clever men have so many days of imposing on that honest goodman the people
by the way i did not hear the sound of your carriage you have left it yonder behind the coppice at the form of the roads no doubt
i do not know you i tell you
you have told me that you are the bishop but that affords me no information as to your moral personality
in short i repeat my question
who are you
you are a bishop that is to say a prince of the church one of those gilded men with heraldic bearings and revenues who have vast pre bends the bishopric of d fifteen thousand francs settled in some ten thousand in perquisites total twenty five thousand francs who have kitchens who have liveries who make good cheer who eat moorhen's on friday who strut about a packet before a lackey behind in a gala coach and who have palaces and who roll in their carriages in the name of jesus christ who went barefoot
you are a pre later when he's palace horses servants good table all the sensual ities of life you have this like the rest and like the best you enjoy it it is well but this says either too much or too little this does not enlighten me up on the intrinsic and essential value of the man who comes with the probable intention of bringing wisdom home
to whom do i speak
who are you
the bishop hung his head and replied ver museum kama work
a work of the earth in a carriage
growled the convention art
it was the convention art's turn to be arrogant and the bishop's to be humble
the bishop resumed mildly some of cig
but explain to me how my carriage which is a few paces off behind the trees yonder how my gold table and the mood mens which i eat on friday how my twenty five thousand francs income how my palace and my lackeys prove that clemency is not a duty and that' was not inexorable
the convention art passed his hand across his brow as though to sweep away a cloud
before replying to you he said i beseech you to pardon me
i have just committed a wrong dir
you are at my house you are my guest i owe you courtesy
you discuss my ideas and it becomes me to confine myself to combating your arguments
your riches and your pleasures are advantages which i hold over you in the debate but good taste dictates that i shall not make use of them
i promise you to make no use of them in the future
i thank you said the bishop
g resumes
let us return to the explanation which you have asked of me
where were we
what were you saying home
that' was inexorable
inexorable yes said the bishop
what think you of marat clapping his hands at the guillotine
what think you off paquet changing the te deum over the dragon hades
the retort was a harsh one but it attained its mark with the directness of a point of steel
the bishop quivered under it noreply occurred to him but he was offended by this mode of alluding to bosquet
the best of minds will have their fetishes and they sometimes feel vaguely wounded by the want of respect of logic
the convention art began to part the asthma of the agony which is mingled with the last breath's interrupted his voice still there was a perfect lock city of soul in his eyes
he went on let me say a few words more in this and that direction i am willing
apart from the revolution which taken as a whole is an immense human affirmation' is alas
a rejoinder
you think it inexorable sit but what of the whole monarchy air
carrier is a bandit but what name do you give to mont devel
flu quiet rainville is a rascal but what is your opinion as to lamour gonna ville
maillard is terrible but saul at st annes if you please
suchen e senior is ferocious but what epithet will you allow me for the elder letellier
jourdan could tetris a monster but not so great a one asm
the marquis de loi void
sure if i am sorry for marie antoinette arch duchess and queen but i am also sorry for that poor bunyan of women who in under louis the great sir while with a nursing infant was bound named to the waist to a stake and the child kept at a distance her breast swelled with milk and her heart with anguish the little one hungry and pale be held that breast and cried and agonized the executioner said to the woman another and a nurse' abjure
' giving her her choice between the death of her infant and the death or her conscience
what say you to that torture of tantalus as applied to another
bear this well in kinds of the french revolution had its reasons for existence it's wrath will be absolved by the future its result is the world made better
from its most terrible blow's there comes forth a caress for the human race
ian dodge i still have too much the advantage moreover i am dying
and ceasing to gaze at the bishop the convention art concluded his thoughts in these tranquil words yes the brutalities of progress are called revolutions
when they are over this fact is recognized that the human race has been treated harshly but that it has progressed
the convention art doubted not that he had successively conquered all the inmost in french ments of the bishop
one remained however and from this in french ment the last resource of monseigneur bienvenu's resistance came forth this reply wherein appeared nearly all the harshness of the beginning progress should believe in god
good can not have an impious we editor
he who is an atheist is but a bad leader for the human race
the former representative of the people made no reply
he was seized with a bit of trembling
he looked towards heaven and in his glance at war gathered slowly
when the eyelid was full the year trickled down his livid cheek and he said almost in a stammer quite low and to himself while his eyes were plugged in the depths of you
o ideal
thou alone exist est
the bishop experienced an indescribable shock
after a pause the old man raised a finger heavenward and said the infinite is
he is there
if the infinite had no person person would be without limit it would not be infinite in other words it would not exist
there is the bank
that i of the infinite is god
the dying man had pronounced these last words in a loud voice and with the shiver of ecstasy as though he beheld someone
when he had spoken his eyes closed
the effort had exhausted hij
it was evident that he had just lived through in a moment the few hours which had been left to him
that which he had said brought him nearer to him who is in death
the supreme moment was approaching
the bishop understood this time pressed it was as a priest that he had come from extreme cold new she had passed by degrees to extreme emotion he gazed at those closed eyes he took that wrinkled aged and ice cold hand in his and bent over the dying man
this hour is the hour of god
do you not think that it would be regrettable if we had met in vain
the convention art opened his eyes again
a gravity mingled with gloom was imprinted on his countenance
bishop said he with a slowness which probably a rose more from his dignity of soul than from the failing of his strength i have passed my life in meditation study and contemplation
i was sixty years of age when my country called me and commanded me to concern myself with its affairs
i obeyed
abuses existed i combated them tyrannies existed i destroyed them rights and principles existed i proclaimed and confessed them
our territory was invaded i defended it france was menaced i offered my breast
i was not rich i am poor
i have been one of the masters of the state the vaults of the treasury were encumbered with specie to such a degree that we were forced to shore up the walls which were on the point of bursting beneath the weight of gold and silver i dined in dead tree street at twenty two sous
i have su scored the oppressed i have comforted the suffering
i tore the cloth from the altar it is true but it was to bind up the wounds of my country
i have always upheld the march forward of the human race forward towards the light and i have sometimes resisted progress without pity
i have when the occasion offered protected my own adversaries men of your profession
and there is at pete them in flanders at the very spot where the merovingian kings had their summer palace a convent of urbanist's the abbey of sainte claire en beaulieu which i saved in
i have done my duty according to my powers and all the good that i was able
after which i was hunted down pursued persecuted blackened jeered at scorned cursed proscribed
for many years past i with my white hair have been conscious that many people think they have the right to despise me to the poor ignorant masses i present the visage of one damned
and i accept this isolation of hatred without hating anyone myself
now i am eighty six years old i am on the point of death
what is it that you have come to ask of me
your blessing said the bishop
and he knelt down
when the bishop raised his head again the face of the convention art has become august
he had just expired
the bishop returned home deeply absorbed in thoughts which can not be known to us
he passed the whole night on prayer
on the following morning some bold and curious per some attempted to speak to him about member of the convention the contented himself with pointing heavenward
from that moment here doubled his tenderness and brotherly feeling towards all children and sufferers
any allusion to that old see echo bay caused him to fall into a singular preoccupation
no one could say that the passage of that soul before his and the reflection of that grand conscience upon his did not count for something in his approach to perfection
this pastoral visit naturally furnished an occasion for a murmur of comment in all the little local coterie s
was the bedside of such a dying man as that the proper place for a bishop
there was evidently no conversion to be expected
all those revolutionists are back sliders
then why not here
what was there to be seen there
he must have been very curious indeed to see a soul carried off by the devil
one day a dowager of the impertinent variety who thinks herself spiritual addressed this sally to him monseigneur people are inquiring when your greatness will receive the red cap
oh
oh
that's a coarse color replied the bishop
it is lucky that those who despise it imac a precede it in a hat
chapter xi a restriction we should incur a great risk of receiving ourselves were as to conclude from this that monseigneur welcome was a philosophical bishop of a patriotic cure
his meeting which may almost be designated as his union with conventions rug left behind it in his mind a sort of astonishment which rendered to'm still more gentle
that is all
although monseigneur bienvenue as far from being a politician this is perhaps the place to indicate very briefly what his attitude was in the events of that epoch supposing that monseigneur bienvenu ever dreamed of having an attitude
let us then go back a few years
sometime after the elevation of m
muriel to the episcopate the emperor had made him a baron of the empire in company with many other bishops
the arrest of the pope took place as everyone knows on the night of the tutor method july on this occasion m
muriel was summoned by napoleon to the synod of the bishops of france and italy convened at paris
this synod was held at notre dame and assembled for the first time ont meth of june under the presidency of cardinal beach
k
muriel was one of the ninety five bishops who attended it
but he was present only at one sitting and at three or four private conferences
bishop of a mountain diocese living so very close to nature in ductivity and deprivation it appeared that he imported among these eminent personages ideas which altered the temperature of the assembly
he very soon returned to she was interrogated as to this speedy return and he replied i embarrassed them
the outside air penetrated to them through me
i produced on them the effect of an open door
on another occasion he said what would you have
those gentlemen are princes
i am only a poor peasant bishop
the fact is that is displeased them
among other strange things it is said that he chanced to remark one evening when he found himself at the house of one of his most notable colleagues what beautiful clocks
what beautiful carpets
what becky if no liveries
they must be a great trouble
i would not have all those super foul ties crying incessantly in my ears' there are people who are hungry
there are people who are sold
there are poor people
there are poor people
' let us remark by the way that the hatred of luxury is not an intelligent hatred
this hatred would involve the hatred of the arts
nevertheless in churchmen luxury is wrong except in connection with representations and ceremonies
it seems to reveal habits which have very little that is charitable about them
an opulent priest is a contradiction
the priest just keep close to the poor
how can one come in contact incessantly night and day with all this distress all these misfortunes and this poverty without having about one's own person a little of that misery like the dust of labor
is it possible to imagine a man near a brazier who is not warm
can one imagine a workman who is working near a furnace and who has neither a singer hair nor blackened gail's not a drop of sweat not a speck of ashes on his face
the first proof of charity in the priest in the bishop especially is poverty
this is no doubt what the bishop of'd thought
it must not be supposed however that he stared what we call the ideas of the century on certain delicate points
he took very little part in the theological quarrels of the moment and maintained silence on questions in which church and state were implicated but if he had been strongly pressed it seems that he would have been found to be an ultra montane rather than a gallivan
since we are making a portrait and since we do not wish to conceal anything we are forced to add that he was glacial towards napoleon in his decline
beginning with behave in his adherence to or applauded all hostile manifestations
he refused to see him as he passed through on his return from the island of elba and he abstained from ordering public prayers for the emperor in his diocese during the hundred days
besides his sister mademoiselle baptist one he had two brothers one a general the others prefect
he wrote to both with tolerable frequency
he was harsh for a time towards the former because holding a command in provence at the epoch of the disembarkation at cannes the general had put himself at the head of twelve hundred men and had pursued the emperor as though the latter had been a person whom one is desirous of allowing to escape
his correspondence with the other brother the ex perfect a fine worthy man who lived in retirement at paris due cassette remained more affection are
this monseigneur bienvenu also had his hour of party spirit his hour of bitterness his cloud
the shadow of the passions of the moment traversed this grand and gentle spirit occupied with eternal things
certainly such a man would have done well not to entertain any political opinions
let there be no mistake as to our meaning we are not confounding what is called political opinions with the grand aspiration for progress with the sublime faith patriotic democratic humane which in our day should be the very foundation of every generous intellect
without going deeply into questions which are only in directly connected with the subject of this book we will simply say this it would have been well if monseigneur bienvenu had not been a royalist and if his glance had never been for a single instant turned away from that serene contemplation in which is distinctly discernible above the fictions and the hatreds of this world above the stormy vicissitudes of human things thebes king of those three pure radiances truth justice and charity
while admitting that it was not for a political office that god created monseigneur welcome we should have understood and admired his protest in the name of right and liberty his proud opposition his just buy perilous resistance to the all powerful napoleon
but that which pleases us if people who are rising please susie's's in the case of people who are falling
we only love the fray so long as there is danger and in any case the combatants of the first hour have alone the right to be the exterminators of the last
he who has not been a stubborn accused in prosperity should hold his peace in the face of ruin
the denuncia tor of success is the only legitimate executioner of the fall
as for us when providence intervenes and strikes we let it work
commenced to disarm us
in the cowardly breach of silence of that taciturn legislative body emboldened by catastrophe possessed only traits which aroused indignation
and it was a crime to applaud in in the presence of those marshals who betrayed in the presence of that senate which passed from one dunghill to another insulting after having deified in the presence of that idolatry which was loosing its footing and spitting on its idol it was a duty to turn aside the head
in when the supreme disasters filled the air when france was seized with a shiver at their sinister approach when waterloo could be dimly discerned opening before napoleon the mournful acclamation of the army and the people to the condemned of destiny had nothing laughable in it and after making all allowance for the despot a heart like that of the bishop one ought not perhaps to have failed to recognize the august and touching features presented by the embrace of a great nation and a great man on the brink of the abyss
with this exception he was in all things just true equitable intelligent humble and dignified beneficent and kindly which is only another sort of benevolence
he was a priest a safe and a man
it must be admitted that even in the political views with which we have just reproached him and which we are disposed to judge almost with severity he was tolerant and easy more so perhaps than we who are speaking here
the porter of the town hall had been placed there by the emperor
he was an old noncommissioned officer of the old guard a member of the legion of honor at austerlitz as much of a bona p artist as the eagle
this poor fellow occasionally let slip inconsiderate remarks which the law then stigmatized as seditious speeches
after the imperial profile disappeared from the legion of honor he never dressed himself in his regimentals as he said so that he should not be obliged to wear his cross
he had himself devoutly removed the imperial effigy from the cross which napoleon has given him this made a hole and he would not put anything in its place
i will die he said rather than wear the three frogs upon my heart
he liked to scoff aloud st louis xviii
the youth old creature in english gaiters
he said let him take himself off to prussia with that queue of his
he was happy to combine in the same in predation the two things which he host detected prussia and england
he did it so often that he lost his place
there he was turned out of the house with his wife and children and without bread
the bishop sent for him reproved him gently and appointed him beadle in the cathedral
in the course of nine years monseigneur bienvenu had by dint of holy deeds and gentle manner's filled the town off with a sort of tender and filial reference
even his conduct towards napoleon had been accepted and tacitly pardoned as it were by the people the good and weakly flock who adored their emperor but loved their bishop
chapter xii the solitude of monseigneur welcome a bishop is almost always surrounded by a full squadron of little anne's just as a general is by a covey of young officers
this is what that charming saint francois de sales calls somewhere le site fees blanc sc sc sc allow priests
every career has its aspirants who form a train for those who have attained eminence in it
there is no power which has not it's dependents
there is no fortune which has not it's court
the seekers of the future eddy around the splendid present
every metropolis has its staff of officials
every bishop who possesses the least influence has about him his patrol of cherubim from the seminary which goes the round and maintains good order in the episcopal palace and mounts guard over monseigneur's smile
top lease a bishop is equivalent to getting one's foot in the stirrup for a sub diaconate
it is necessary to walk one's path discreetly the apostleship does not disdain the canon ship
just as there are bigwigs elsewhere there are big hit resin the church
these are the bishops who stand well at court who are rich well endowed skilful accepted by the world who know how to pray no doubt but who know also how to her who feel little scruple at making a whole diocese dance attendance in their person who are connecting links between the sacristy and diplomacy who are anne's rather than priests prelates rather than bishops
happy those who approach them
being persons of influence they create a shower about them upon the assiduous and the favored and upon all the young men who understand the art of pleasing of large parishes prev ends archi diaconate's chaplain cies and cathedral posts while awaiting episcopal honors
as they advance themselves they cause their satellites to progress also it is a whole solar system on the march
the irradiance casts a gleam of purple over their suite
their prosperity is crumbled up behind the scenes into nice little promotions
the larger the diocese of the patron the father the curacy for the favorite
and then there is rome
a bishop who understands how to become an archbishop an archbishop who knows how to become a cardinal carries you with him as conc lavish you enter a court of papal jurisdiction you receive the pallium and behold
you are an auditor the gap also chamberlain then monsignor and from a grace to an eminence is only a step and between the eminence and the holiness there is but the smoke of a ballot
every skull cap may dream of the tiara
the priest is nowadays the only man who can become a king in a regular manner and what a king
the supreme king
then what a nursery of aspirations is a seminary
how many blushing choristers how many youthful anne's best of their heads perret he's lot of milk
who knows how easy it is for ambition to call itself vocation
in good faith perchance and receiving itself devoted that it is
monseigneur bienvenu poor humble retiring was not accounted among the big hit res
this was plain from the complete absence of young priest's about him
we have seen that he did not take in paris
not a single figure dreamed of eng rafting itself on this solitary old man
not a single sprouting ambition committed the folly of putting forth its foliage in his shadow
his canons and grand vicars were good old men rather vulgar like himself walked up like him in this diocese without exit to a cardinal ship and who resembles their bishop with this difference that they were finished and he was completed
the impossibility of growing great under monseigneur bienvenu was so well understood that no sooner had the young men whom he ordained left the seminary than they got themselves recommended to the archbishops of six or of such and went off in a great hurry
for in short we repeat it men wish to be pushed
a saint who dwells in a paroxysm of abnegation is a dangerous neighbor he might communicate to you by contagion an incurable poverty anand by locus of the joints which are useful in advancement and in short more renunciation than you desire and this infectious virtue is avoided
hence the isolation of monseigneur bienvenu
we live in the midst of a gloomy society
success that is the lesson which falls drop by drop from the slope of corruption
belts and in passing that success is a very hideous thing
it's false resemblance to merit receives men

chapter xiii what he believed we are not obliged to sound the bishop off on the score of orthodoxy
in the presence of such a soul we feel ourselves in no mood but respect
the conscience of the just man should be accepted on his word
moreover certain nature's being given we admit the possible development of all beauties of human virtue in a belief that differs from our own
what did he think of this dogma or of that mystery
these secrets of the inner tribunal of the conscience are known only to the tomb where would enter naked
the point on which we are certain is that the video culties of faith never resolved themselves into hypocrisy in his case
no decay is possible to the diamond
he believed to the extent of his powers
credo in p q then he often exclaimed
moreover he drew from good works that amount of satisfaction which suffices to the conscience and which whispers to a man thou art with god
the point which we consider it our duty to note is that outside of and beyond his faith as it were the bishop possessed an excess of love
it was in that quarter qui a multi mahavir because he loved much that he was regarded as vulnerable by serious men grave persons and reasonable people favorite lock tions of our sad world where egotism takes its word of command from pedantry
what was this excess of love
it was a serene benevolence which overflowed men as we have already pointed out and which on occasion extended even to things
he lived without disdain
he was indulgent towards god's creation
every man even the best has within him a thoughtless harshness which he reserves for animals
the bishop of'd had none of that harshness which is peculiar to many priests nevertheless
he did not go as far as the brahmin but he seemed to have weighed this saying of ecclesiastes who knoweth whither the soul of the animal north
hideous ness of aspect deformity of instinct troubled him not and did not arouse his indignation
he was touched almost softened by them
it seemed as though he went thoughtfully a way to seek beyond the hounds of life which is apparent the cause the explanation of the excuse for them
he seemed at times to be asking god to commute these penalties
he examined without wrath and with the eye of a linguist who is deciphering a palimpsest that portion of chaos which still exists in nature
this're very sometimes caused him to utter odd sayings
one morning he was in his garden and thought himself alone but his sister was walking behind him unseen by him suddenly he paused and gazed at something on the ground it was a large black hairy frightful spider
his sister heard him say poor beast
it is not it's fault
why not mention these almost divinely childish sayings of kindness
puerile they may be but these sublime pier iii ties were peculiar to saint francisd' assisi and of marcus aurelius
one day he sprained his ankle in his effort to avoid stepping on an ant
this loved this just man
sometimes he fell asleep in his garden and then there was nothing more vegetable possible
monseigneur bienvenu had formerly been if the stories and by his youth and even in regard to his manhood were to be believed a passionate and possibly a violent man
his universal sua city was less an instinct of nature than the result of a brand conviction which had filtered into his heart through the medium of life and had trickled there slowly thought by thought for in a character as in stock there may exist apertures made by drops of water
these hollowware in efface able these forms tions are indestructible
in as we think we have already said he reached his we betty fifth birthday but he did not appear to be more than sixty
he was not fall he was rather plump and in order to combat this tendency he was fond of taking longer rolls on foot his step was firm and his form was but slightly bent a detail from which we do not pretend to draw any conclusion
gregory xvi
at the age of eighty held himself erect and smiling which did not prevent him from being a bad bishop
monseigneur welcome had what the people terms fine head but so amiable waste that they forgot that it was gone
when he conversed with that infantile gayety which was one of his charms and of which we have already spoken people felt at their ease with him and joy seemed to radiate from his whole person
his fresh and ruddy complexion his very white teeth all of which he had preserved and which were displayed by his smile gave him that open and easy air which cause the remark to be made of a manhe'sa good fellow and of an old man he is a fine man
that it will be recalled was the effect which he produced upon napoleon
on the first encounter and to one who saw him for the first time he was nothing in fact but a fine man
but is one remained near him for a few hours and beheld him in the least degree pensive the fine man became gradually transfigured and took on some imposing quality i know not what his broad and serious brow rendered august by his white locks became august also by virtue of meditation majesty radiated from his goodness though his goodness ceased not to be radiant one experienced something of the emotion which one would feelin be holding a smiling angel slowly unfold his wings without ceasing to smile
respect an unutterable respect penetrated you by degrees and mounted to your heart and one felt that one had before him one of those strong thoroughly tried and indulgent souls where thought is so grand that it can no longer be anything but gentle
as we have seen prayer the celebration of the offices of religion almsgiving the consolation of the afflicted the cultivation of a bit of land fraternity frugality hospitality renunciation confidence study work filled every day of his life
filled is exactly the word certainly the bishop's day was quite full to the brim of good words and good deeds
nevertheless it was not completely sold or rainy weather prevented his passing an hour or two in his garden before going to bed and after the two women had retired
it seemed to be a sort of rife with him to prepare himself for slumber my meditation in the presence of the grand spectacles of the nocturnal heavens
sometimes if the two old women were not asleep they heard him pacing slowly along the walls at a very advanced hour of the night
he was there alone communing with himself peaceful adoring comparing the serenity of his heart with the serenity of the ether moved amid the darkness by the visible splendor of the constellations and the invisible splendor of god opening his heart to the thoughts which fall from the unknown
at such moments while he offered his heart at the hour when nocturnal flowers offer their perfume illuminated like a lamp amid the starry night as he poured himself out in ecstasy in the midst of the universal radiance of creation he could not have told himself probably what was passing in his spirit he felt something take it's flight from him and something descend into min
mysterious exchange of the abysses of the soul with the abysses of the universe
he thought of the grandeur and presence of god of the future eternity that strange mystery of the eternity pasta mystery still more strange of all the infinities which pierced their way into all his senses beneath his eyes and without seeking to comprehend the in comprehensible he gazed upon it
he did not study god he was dazzled by him
he considered those magnificent conjunct kind of atoms which communicate aspects to matter reveal forces by verifying them create individual ities in unity proportions in extent the innumerable in the infinite and through light produce beauty
these conjunctions are formed and dissolved incessantly hence life and death
he seated himself on a wooden bench with his back against a decrepit vine he gazed at the stars past the puny and stunted silhouettes of his fruit trees
this quarter of an were so poorly planted so encumbered with mean buildings and sheds was dear to him and satisfied his wants
what more was needed by this old man who divided the leisure of his life where there was so little leisure between gardening in the daytime and contemplation at night
was not this narrow enclosure with the heavens for a ceiling sufficient to enable him how does god in his most divine works in turn
does not this comprehend all in fact
and what is there peer to desire beyond it
a little garden in which to walk and immensity in which to dream
at one's feet that which can be cultivated and plucked overhead that which one can study and meditate upon some flowers on earth and all the stars in the sky
chapter xiv what he thought one last word
since this sort of details might particularly at the present moment and to use an expression now in fashion give to the bishop off a certain pantheistic al physiognomy and induce the belief either to his credit or discredit that he entertained one of those personal philosophies which are peculiar to our century which sometimes spring up in solitary spirits and there take on a form and grow until they usurp the place of religion we insist upon it that no tons of those persons who knew monseigneur welcome would have thought himself authorized to think anything of the sort
that which enlightened this man was his heart
his wisdom was made of the light which comes from there
no systems many works
abstruse speculations contain vertigo nl there is nothing to indicate that he risked his mind in apocalypse s
the apostle maybe dating but the bishop must be timid
he would probably have felt a scruple at sounding too far in advance certain problems which are in a manner reserved for terrible great minds
there is a sacred horror beneath the porches of the enigma those gloomy openings stand yawning there but something tells you you a passerby in life that you must not enter
woe to him who penetrates thither
geniuses in the impenetrable depths of abstraction and pure speculation situated so to speak above all dogmas propose their ideas to god
their prayer audaciously offers discussion
their adoration interrogs yes
this is direct religion which is full of anxiety and responsibility for him who attempts its steep cliffs
human meditation has no limits
at his own risk and peril it analyzes and digs deep into its own be dazzle nent
one might almost say that by a sort of splendid reaction it with it ga sales nature the mysterious world which surrounds us renders back what it has received it is probable that the contempo store are contemplated
however that maybe there are on earth men who are they men
perceive distinctly at the verge of the horizons of revert the heights of the absolute and who have the terrible vision of the infinite mountain
monseigneur welcome was one of these men monseigneur welcome was not a genius
he would have feared those sub limitless hence some very great men even like swedenborg and pascal have slipped into insanity
certainly these powerful reveries have their moral utility and by these arduous paths one approaches to ideal perfection
as for him he took the path which shortens the gospel's
he did not attempt to impart to tisch a sublette folds of elijah's mantle he projected no ray of future upon the dark groundswell of events he did not seem to condense inflame the light of things he had nothing of the pro one hand nothing of the magician about him
this humble soul loved and that was all
that he carried prayer to the pitch of a superhuman aspiration is prone ble but one can no more pray too much than one can love too much and if it is a heresy to pray beyond the texts saint theresa and saint jerome would be heretics
he inclined towards all that groans and all that ex plates
the universe appeared to him like an immense malady everywhere he felt fever everywhere he heard the sound of suffering and without seeking to solve the enigma he strove to dress the wound
the terrible spectacle of created things developed tenderness in him he was occupied only in funding for himself and in inspiring others with the best way to compassionate and relieve
that which exists was for this good and rare priest a permanent subject of sadness which sought consolation
there are men who toil at extracting gold he toiled at the extraction of pity
universal misery was his mind
the sadness which reigned everywhere was but an excuse for unfailing kindness
love each other he declared this to be complete desired nothing further and that was the whole of his doctrine
one day that man who believed himself to be a philosopher the senator who has already been alluded to said to the bishop just survey the spectacle of the world all war against all the strongest has the most wit
your love each other is nonsense
well replied monseigneur welcome without contesting the point if it is nonsense the soul should shut itself upon it as the pearl in the oyster
thus he shut himself up he lived there he was absolutely satisfied with it leaving on one side the prodigious questions which attract and terrify the fathomless perspectives of abstraction the precipices of metaphysics all those profundo ties which converge for the apostle in god for the atheist in nothingness destiny good and evil the way of being against being the conscience of man the thoughtful com nambu pick of the animal the transformation in death the recapitulation of existences which the tomb contains the in comprehensible grafting of successive lives on the persistent i. the essence the substance the nile and the end the soul nature liberty necessity perpendicular problems sinister obscurities where lean the gigantic archangels of the human mind formidable abysses which lucretius man oh saint paul van de contemplate with eyes flashing lightning which seems ny its steady gaze on the infinite to cause stars to blaze forth there
monseigneur bienvenu was simply a man who took note of the exterior of mysterious questions without scrutinizing them and without troubling his own mind with them and who cherished in his own soul a grave respect for darkness
book second the fall chapter i. the evening of a way of walking early in the month of october about an hour before sunset a man who was travelling on foot entered the little town off the few inhabitants who were at their windows or on their thresholds at the moment stares at this traveller with a sort of uneasiness
it was difficult to encounter a wayfarer of more wretched appearance
he was a man of medium stature thick set and robust in the prime of life
he might have been forty six or forty eight years old
a cap with a drooping leather visor partly concealed his face burned and fanned by sun and wind and dripping with perspiration
his shirt of coarse yellow linen fastened at the neck by a small silver and not permitted a view of his hairy breast he had a cravat twisted into a string trousers of blue drilling worn and threadbare white on one knee and torn on the other an old gray tattered blouse patches on one of the elbows with a bit of green cloth sewer on with two me a tightly packed soldier knapsack well buckled and perfectly new on his back an enormous knotty stick in his hand iron shox shoes on his stocking less feet a shaved head and a long beard
the sweat the near the journey on foot the dust added i know not what sordid quality to this dilapidated whole
his hair was closely cutter bristling for it had begun to grow a little and did not seem to have been cut for some time
no one knew him
he was evidently only a chance passerby
whence came he
from the south from the seashore perhaps for he made his entrance into'd by the same street which seven months previously had witnessed the passage of the emperor napoleon on his way from cannes to paris
this man must have been walking all day
he seemed very much fatigued
some women of the ancient market town which is situated below the city had seen him pause beneath the trees of the boulevard gas sendo and drink at the fountain which stands at the end of the promenade
he must have been very thirsty for the children who followed him saw him stop again for a drink two hundred paces further on at the fountain in the marketplace
on arriving at the corner of the the pouch every he turned to the left and directed his steps toward the town hall
he entered then came out a quarter of an hour later
agenda due was seated near the door on the stone bench which general drouot had mounted on the th of march to read to the frightened throng of the inhabitants off the proclamation of the gulf juan
the man pulled off his cap and humbly saluted the gendarme
the gendarme without replying to his salute stated attentively at him followed him for awhile with his eyes and then entered the town hall
there then existed at racine inn at the sign of the cross off olbas
this inn had for a landlord a certain jacquin la barre a man of consideration in the town on account of his relationship to another la barre who kept the ing of the three dauphine in grenoble and had served in the guides
at the time of the emperor's landing many rumors had circulated throughout the country with regard to this inn of the three dauphine
it was said that general bertrand disguised as a carter had made frequent trips thither in the month of january and that he had distributed crosses of honor to the soldiers and handfuls of good to the citizens
the truth is that when the emperor entered grenoble he had refused to install himself at the hotel of the prefecture he had thanked the mayor saying i am going to the house of a brave man of my acquaintance and he had be taken himself to the three dauphine
this glory of the la barre of the three dauphine was reflected upon the la barre of the cross of silva data distance office and twenty leagues
it was said of him in the town that is the cousin of the man of grenoble
the man bent his steps towards this inn which was the best in the countryside
he entered the kitchen which opened on a level with the street
all the stoves were lighted a huge fire blazer fault in the fireplace
the host who was also the chief room was going from one crew pan to another very busily superintending an excellent dinner designed for the wagoner's whose loud talking conversation and laughter were audible from an adjoining apartment
anyone who has travelled knows that there is no one who indulges in better cheer than wagoner s
a rat marmot flanked by white partridges and heather cocks was turning on a long spot before the fire on the stove two huge warps from pamela user and a trout from lake all oz were cooking
the most hearing the door open and seeing a newcomer enter said without raising his eyes from his stoves what do you wish air
food and lodging said the man
nothing easier replied the host
at that moment he turned his head took in the traveller's appearance with a single glance and added by paying for it
the man drew a large leather purse from the pocket of his blouse and answered i have money
in that case we are at your service said the host
the man put his purse back in his pocket removed his knapsack from his back put it on the ground near the door retained his stick in his hand and seated himself on a low stool close to the fire
die in the mountains
the evenings are cold there in october
but as the most sent back and forth be scrutinized the traveller
will dinner be ready soon
said the man
immediately replied the landlord
while the newcomer was warming himself before the fire with his back turned the worthy host jacquin la barre drew a pencil from his pocket then tore off the corner of an old newspaper which was lying on a small table near the window
on the white margin he wrote a line or two folded it without sealing and then intrusted this scrap of paper to a child who seemed to serve him in the capacity both of scullion and lackey
the landlord whispered a word in the scullion's ear and the child set off on a run in the direction of the town hall
the traveller saw nothing of all this
once more he inquired will dinner be ready soon
immediately responded the host
the child returned
he brought back the paper
the most unfolded it eagerly like a person who is expecting a reply
he seemed to read it attentively then tossed his head and remained thoughtful for a moment
then he took a step in the direction of the traveller who appeared to be immersed in reflections which were not very serene
i can not receive you sir said he
the man half rose
what
are you afraid that i will not pay you
do you want me to pay you in advance
i have money i tell you
it is not that
what then
you have money yes said the man
and i said the host have no room
the man resumed tranquilly put me in the stable
i can not
why
the horses take up all the space
very well
retorted the man a corner of the loft then a truss of straw
we will see about that after dinner
i can not give you any dinner
this declaration made in a measured but firm to be struck the stranger as grave
he rose
ah
bag
but i am dying of hunger
i have been walking since sunrise
i have travelled twelve leagues
i pay
i wish to eat
i have nothing said the landlord
the man burst out laughing and turned towards the fireplace and the above's nothing
and all that
all that is engaged
by whom
by messieurs the wagoner s
how many are there of them
twelve
there is enough food there fort wet t u
they have engaged the whole of it and paid for it in advance
the man seated himself again and said without raising his voice i am at shinn i am hungry and i shall remain
then the most bent down to his ear and said in a tone which made him start go away
at that moment the traveller was bending forward and thrusting some brands into the fire with the irons hoc top of his staff he turned quickly round and as he opened his mouth to reply the host based steadily at him and added still in a low voice stop
there's enough of that sort of talk
do you want me to tell you your name
your name is jean valjean
now so you want me to tell you who you are
when i saw you come in. i suspected something i sent to the town hall and this was the reply that was sent to me
can you read
so saying he held out to the stranger fully unfolded the paper which had just travelled from the inn to the town hall and from the town hall to the inn
the man cast a glance upon it
the landlord resumed after a pause
i am in the habit of being polite to everyone
go away
the man dropped his head picked up the knapsack which he had deposited on the ground and took his departure
he chose the principal street
he walked straight on at a venture keeping close to the houses like a sad and humiliated man
he did not turn round a single time
had he done so he would have seen the most of the cross of coon we standing on his threshold surrounded by all the guests of his inn and all the passersby in the street talking vivaciously and pointing him out with his finger and from the glances of terror and distrust cast by the group he might have divined that his arrival would speedily become an event for the whole town
he saw nothing of all this
people who are crushed do not look behind them
they know but too well the evil fate which follows them
thus he proceeded for some time walking on without ceasing traversing at random streets of which he knew nothing forgetful of his fatigue as is often the case when a man is sad
all at once he felt the pangs of hunger sharply
night was drawing near
he glanced about him to see whether he could not discover some shelter
the fine hostelry was closed to him he was seeking some very humble public house some novel however lowly
just then a light flashed up at the end of the streets spine branch suspended from across beam of iron was outlined against the white sky of the twilight
he proceeded thither
it proved to be in fact a public house
the public house which is in the rue de chat faut
the wayfarer halted for a moment and peeped through the window into the interior of the low studded room of the public house illuminated by a small lamp on a table and by a large fire on the hearth
some men were engaged in drinking there
the landlord was warming himself
an iron pot suspended from a crane bubbles over the flame
the entrance to this public house which is also a sort of an inn is by two doors
one opens on the street the other upon a small yard filled with manure
the travellers are not enter by the street door
he slipped into the yard halted again then raised the latch timidly and opened the door
who goes there
said the master
someone who wants supper and bed
good
we furnish supper and bed here
he entered
all the men who were drinking turned round
the lamp illuminated him on one side the firelight on the other
they examined him for some time while he was taking off his knapsack
the host said to him there is the fire
the supper us cooking in the pot
come and warm yourself comrade
he approached and seated himself near the hearth
he stretched out his feet which were exhausted with fatigue to the fires fine odor was emitted by the pit
all that could be distinguished of his face beneath his cap which was well pulled down assumed a vague appearance of comfort mingled with that other poignant aspect which habitual suffering bestows
it was more over a firm energetic and melancholy profile
this physiognomy was strangely composed of began by seeking humble and ended by seeking severe
the eyes home beneath it slashes like a fire beneath brushwood
one of the men seated at the table however was a fishmonger who before entering the public house of the rue de chat faut had been to stable his horse at la barre's
it chanced that he had that very morning encountered this in pre possessing stranger on the road between brasd' asse and i have forgotten the name
i think it was esco union
now when he met him the man who then seemed already extremely weary had requested him to take him on his cry port to which the fishmonger had made no reply except byte doubling his gait
this fishmonger had been a member half an hour previously of the group which surrounded jacquin la barre and had himself related his disagreeable encounter on the morning to the people at the cross of colfax
from where he sat he made an imperceptible sign to the tavern keeper
the tavern keeper went to him
they exchanged a few words in a low tone
the man had again become absorbed in his reflections
the tavern keeper returned to the fireplace laid his hand abruptly on the shoulder of the man and said to him you are going to get out of here
the stranger turned round and replied gently am
you know
yes
i was sent away from the other inn
and you are to be turned out of this one
where would you have me go
elsewhere
the man took his stick and his knapsack and departed
as he went out some children who had followed him from the cross of colfax and who seemed to be lying in wait for him threw stones at him
he retraced his steps in anger and threatened them with his stick the children dispersed like a flock of birds
he passed before the prison
at the door hung an iron chain attached to a bell
he rang
the wicket opened
turnkey said he removing his cap politely will you have the kindness to admit me and give me a lodging for the night
a voice replied the prison is not an inn
get yourself arrested and you will be admitted
the wicket closed again
he entered a little street in which there were many gardens
some of them are enclosed only by hedges which lends a cheerful aspect to the street
in the midst of these gardens and hedges he caught sight of a small house of a single story the window of which was lighted up
he peered through the page as he had done at the public house
within was a large white washed room with a bed draped in printed cotton stuff and a cradle in one corner a few wooden chairs and a double barrelled fun hanging on the wall
a table was spread in the centre of the room
a copper lamp illuminated the tablecloth of coarse white linen the pewter jun shining like silver and filled with wine and the brown smoking soup tureen
at this tables at a man of about forty with a jerry and open countenance who was candling a little child on his knees
close by a very young woman was nursing another child
the father was laughing the child was laughing the mother was willing
the stranger paused a moment in revert before this tender and calming spectacle
what was taking place within him
he alone could have told
it is probable that he thought that this joyous house would be hospitable and that in a place where he beheld so much happiness he would find perhaps a little pity
he tapped on the page with a very small and feeble knock
they did not hear him
he tapped again
he heard the woman say it seems to me husband that someone is knocking
no replied the husband
he tapped a third time
the husband rose took the lamp and went to the door which he opened
he was a man of lofty stature half peasant half artisan
he wore a huge leather apron which reached to his left shoulder and which a hammer a red handkerchiefs powder horn and all sorts of objects which were upheld by the tire lead in a pocket causes to bulge out
he carried his head thrown backwards his shirt widely opened and turned back displayed his full neck white and bars
he had thick eyelashes enormous black whiskers prominent eyes the lower part of his face like a shout and besides all this that air of being on his own ground which is indescribable
pardon me sir said the wayfarer could you in consideration of payment give me a plate of soup and a corner of that she'd yonder in the garden in which to sleep
tell me can you
for money
who are you
demanded the master of the house
the man replied i have just come from put mouse on
i have walked all day long
i have travelled twelve leagues
can you
if i pay
i would not refuse said the peasant to lodge any respectable man who would pay me
but why do you not go to the inn
there is no room
bah
impossible
this is neither a fair not a market day
have you been to la barre
yes
well
the traveller replied with embarrassment i do not know
he did not receive me
have you been to what's his name's in the rusch affair
the stranger's embarrassment increased he stammered he did not receive me either
the peasant's countenance assumed an expression of distrust he surveyed the newcomer from head to feet and suddenly exclaimed with a sort of shudder are you the man
he cast a fresh glance upon the stranger took three steps backwards placed the lamp on the table and took his gun down from the wall
meanwhile at the words are you the man
the woman had risen had clasped her two children in her arms and had taken refuge precipitate it behind her husband staring in terror at the stranger with her bosom uncovered and with frightened eyes as she murmured in slow to get so marquee
all this took place unless time than it requires to picture it to one's self
after having scrutinized the man for several moments as one scrutinised a viper the master of the house returned to the door and said clearout
for pity's sake a glass of water said the man
a shot from my gun
said the peasant
then he closed the door violently and the man heard him shoot two large bolts
a moment later the window shutter was closed and the sound of a bar of iron which was placed against it was audible outside
night continued to fall
a cold wind from the alps was blowing
by the light of the expiring day the stranger perceived in one of the gardens which bordered the streets sort of hut which seemed to him to be built of sods
he climbed over the wooden fence resolutely and found himself in the garden
he approached the hut it's door consisted of a very low and narrow aperture and it resembled those buildings which road laborers construct for themselves along the roads
he thought without doubt that it was in fact the dwelling of a road laborer he was suffering from cold and hunger but this was at least a shelter from the cold
this sort of dwelling is not usually occupied at night
he threw himself flat on his face and crawled into the hut
it was warm there and he found a tolerably good bed of straw
he lay for a moment stretched out on this bed without the power to make a movement so fatigued waste
then as the knapsack on his back was in his day and as it furnished moreover a pillow ready to his hand he set about in buckling one of the straps
at that moment a ferocious growl became audible
he raised his eyes
the head of an enormous dog was outlined in the darkness at the entrance of the hut
it was a dog's kennel
he was himself vigorous and formidable he armed himself with his staff made a shield of his knapsack and made his way out of the kennel in the best way he could not without enlarging the rents in his tags
he left the garden in the same manner but backwards being obliged in order to keep the dog respectful to have recourse to that manoeuvre with his stick which masters in that sort of fencing designate as larose c ouverte
when he had not without difficulty re passed the fence and found himself once more in the street alone without refuge without shelter without a roof over his head chased even from that bed of straw and from that miserable kennel he dropped rather than seated himself on a stone and it appears that a passerby heard him exclaim i am not even a dog
he soon rose again and resumed his match
he went out of the town hoping to find some tree or haystack in the fields which would afford him shelter
he walked thus for a one time with his head still drooping
when he felt himself far from every human habitation he raised his eyes and gazed search ingly about him
he was in a field
before him was one of those low hills covered with close cut stubble which after the harvest resemble shaved heads
the horizon was perfectly black
this was not alone the obscurity of night it was caused by very low hanging clouds which seemed to rest upon the hill itself and which were mounting and filling the whole sky
meanwhile as the moon was about to rise and as there was still floating in the zenith a remnant of the brightness of twilight these clouds formed at the summit of the sky a sort of shit is march whence a gleam of light fell upon the earth
the earth was thus better lighter than the sky which produces a particularly sinister effect and the hill whose contour was poor and means as outlined vague and wan against the gloomy horizon
the whole effect was hideous petty lugubrious and narrow
there was nothing in the field or on the hill except a deformed tree which writhed and shivered a few paces distant from the wayfarer
this man was evidently very far from having those delicate habits of intelligence and spirit which render one sensible to the mysterious aspects of things nevertheless there was something in that sky in that hill in that plain in that tree which was so profoundly desolate that after a moment of immobility and're very he turned back abruptly
there are instants when nature seems hostile
he retraced his steps the gates of'd were closed
d. which had sustained sieges during the wars of religion was still surrounded in by ancient walls flanked by square towers which have been demolished since
he passed through a breach and entered the town again
it might have been eighto'clock in the evening
as he was not acquainted with the streets here commenced his walk at random
in this way he came to the prefecture then to the seminary
as he passed through the cathedral square he shook his fist at the church
at the corner of this square there is a printing establishment
it is there that the proclamations of the emperor and of the on perkal guard to the army brought from the island of elba and dictated by napoleon himself were printed for the first time
worn out with fatigue and no longer entertaining any hope he lay down on a stone bench which stands at the doorway of this printing office
at that moment an old woman came out of the church
she saw the man stretched out in the shadow
what are you doing there my friend
said she
he answered harshly and angrily as you see my good woman i am sleeping
the good woman who was well worthy the name in fact was the marquise de ron this bench
she went on
i have had a mattress of wood for nineteen years said the man today i have a mattress of stone
you have been a soldier
yes my good woman a soldier
why do you not go to the inn
because i have no money
alas
said madame der i have only foursome in my purse
give it come all the same
the man took the four skis
madam ever continued you can not obtain lodgings in an inn for so small as uk
but have you tried
it is impossible for you to pass the night thus
you are cold and hungry no doubt
someone might have given you a lodging out of charity
i have knocked at all doors
well
i have been driven away everywhere
the good woman touched the man's arm and pointed out to him on the other side of the streets shall lie house which stood beside the bishop's palace
you have knocked at all doors
yes
have you knocked at that one
no
knock there
chapter ii prudence counselled to wisdom
that evening the bishop off after his promenade through the town remained shut up rather late in his room
he was busy over a great work on duties which was never completed unfortunately
he was carefully compiling everything that the fathers and the doctors have said on this important subject
his book was divided into two parts firstly the duties of all secondly the duties of each individual according to the class to which he belongs
the duties of all are the great duties
there are four of these
saint matthew points them out duties towards god matt
vi
duties towards one's self matt
v
duties towards one's neighbor matt
vii
duties towards animals matt
vi
as for the other duties the bishop found them pointed out and prescribed elsewhere to sovereigns and subjects in the epistle to the romans to magistrates to wives to mothers to young men by saint of her to husband's father's children and servants in the epistle to the ephesians to the faithful in the epistle to the hebrews to virgins in the epistle to the corinthians
out of these precepts he was laboriously constructing a harmonious whole which he desired to present to souls
an eighto'clock he was still at work writing with a good deal of inconvenience moon little squares of paper with a big book open on his knees when madame magloire entered according to her wont to get the silverware from the cupboard near his bed
a moment later the bishop knowing that the table was set and that his sister was probably waiting for him why this book rose from his table and entered the dining room
the dining room was an oblong a part ment with a fireplace which had a door opening on the street as we have said and a window opening on the garden
madame magloire was in fact just putting the past touches to the table
as she performed this service she was conversing with mademoiselle baptist one
alamo stood in the table the table was near the fireplace
's wood fire was burning there
one can easily picture to one's self these two women both of whom were over sixty years of age
madame magloire small plump vivacious mademoiselle baptist in event of slender trail somewhat taller than her brother dressed in a town of pgce colored silk of the fashion of which she had purchased at that date in paris and which had lasted ever since
to borrow vulgar phrases which possess the merit of giving utterance in a single word to an idea which a whole page would hardly suffice to express madame magloire had the air of a peasant and mademoiselle baptist one that of a lady
madame magloire wore a white quilted caps gold jeannette cross on a velvet ribbon upon her neck the only bit of feminine jewelry that there was in the house a very whitefish k puffing out from a town of coarse black woollen stuff with large short sleeves an apron of cotton cloth in red and green checks knotted found the waist with a green ribbon with a stomache for the same attached by two pins at the upper corners coarse shoes on her feet and yellow stockings like the women of marseilles
mademoiselle baptist one's gown was cut on the patterns of with a short waist a narrow sheath like skirt puffed sleeves with flaps and buttons
she concealed her gray hair under a frizz edwin known as the baby rib
madame magloire had an intelligent vivacious and kindly air the two corners of her mouth unequally raised and her upper lip which was larger than the lower imparted to her a rather grabbed and imperious look
so long as monseigneur held his peace she talked to him resolutely with a mixture of respect and freedom but as soon as monseigneur began to speak as we have seen she obeyed passively like her mistress
mademoiselle baptist one did not even speak
she confined herself to obeying and pleasing him
she had never been pretty even when she was young she had large blue prominent eyes and along arched nose but her whole view re her whole person breathed fort jan ineffable goodness as we stated in the beginning
she had always been predestined to gentleness but faith charity hold those three virtues which kilroy darn the soul had gradually elevated that gentleness to sanctity
nature had made her a lamb religion had made her an angel
poor sainted virgin
sweet memory which has vanished
mademoiselle baptist one has so often narrated what passed at the episcopal residence that evening that there are many people now living who still recall the most minute details
at the moment when the bishop entered madame magloire was talking with considerable vivacity
she was haranguing mademoiselle baptist one on a subject which was familiar to her and to which the bishop was also accustomed
the question concerned the lockup on the entrance door
it appears that while procuring some provisions for supper madame magloire had heard things in divers places
people had spoken or a prowler of evil appearances suspicious vagabond had arrived who must be somewhere about the town and those who should take it into their heads to return home page that night might be subjected to unpleasant encounters
the police was very badly organized moreover because there was no love lost between the prefect and the mayor who sought to injure each other by making things happen
it behooves wise people to play the part of their own police and to guard themselves well and care must be taken to suit close bar and barricade their houses and to fasten the doors well
madame magloire emphasized these last words but the bishop had just come from his room where it was rather cold
he seated himself in front of the fire and warmed himself and then fell to thinking of other things
he did not take up the remark dropped with design by madame magloire
she repeated it
then mademoiselle baptist one desirous of satisfying madame magloire without displeasing her brother ventured to say timidly did you hear what madame magloire is saying brother
i have heard something of it in a vague way replied the bishop
then half turning in his chair placing his hands on his knees and raising towards the old servant woman his cordial face which so easily grew joyous and which was illuminated from below by the firelight come what is the matter
what is the matter
areas in any great danger
then madame magloire began the whole story arrest exaggerating it a little without being aware of the fact
it appeared that a bohemian a barefooted vagabond a sort of dangerous mendicant was at that moment in the town
he had presented himself at jacquin la barre's to obtain lodgings but the latter had not been willing to take him in
he had been seen to arrive by the way of the boulevard gas sendo and roam about the streets in the glow ming
a gallows bird with a terrible case
really
said the bishop
this willingness to interrogate encouraged madame magloire it seemed to her to indicate that the bishop was on the point of becoming alarmed she pursued triumphantly yes monseigneur
that is how it is
there will be some sort of catastrophe in this town tonight
everyone says so
and withal the police is so badly regulated a useful repetition
the idea of living in a mountainous country and not even having lights in the streets at night
one goes out
black as ovens indeed
and is an monseigneur and mademoiselle there days with me i interrupted his sister say nothing
what my brother does is well done
madame magloire continued as though there had been no protest we say that this house is not safe at all that if monseigneur will permit i will go and tell paul in his ego is the locksmith to come and replace the ancient locks on the doors we have them and it is only the work of a moment for i say that nothing is more terrible than a door which can be opened from the outside with a patch by the first passerby and i say that we need bolts monseigneur if only for this night moreover monseigneur has the habit of always saying' come in' and besides even in the middle of the night i mon dieu
there is no need to ask permission
at that moment there came a tolerably violent knock on the door
come in said the bishop
chapter iii the heroism of passive obedience
the door opened
it opened wide with a rapid movement as though someone had given it an energetic and resolute push
a man entered
we already know the man
it was the wayfarer whom we have seen wandering about in search of shelter
he entered advanced a step and halted leaving the door open behind him
he had his knapsack in his shoulders his cudgel in his hands rough audacious weary and violent expression in his eyes
the fire on the hearth lighted him up
he was hideous
it was a sinister apparition
madame magloire has not even the strength to utter a cry
and trembled and stood with her mouth wide open
mademoiselle baptist one turned round be held the man entering and half started up in terror then turning her head by degrees towards the fire place again she began to observe her brother and her face became once more profoundly calm and serene
the bishop fixed a tranquil eye on the man
as he opened his mouth doubtless to ask the newcomer what he desired the man tested both hands in his staff directed his gaze at the old man and the two women and without waiting for the bishop to speak he said in a loud voice see here
my name is jean valjean
i am a convict from the galleys
i have passed nineteen years in the galleys
i was liberated four days ago and am on my way to pont de life which is my destination
i have been walking for four days since i left toulon
i have travelled a dozen leagues today on foot
this evening when i arrived in these parts i went to an inn and they turned me out because of my yellow passport which i had shown at the town hall
i had to do it
i went to an inn
they said to me've off' at both places
no one would take me
i went to the prison the jailer would not admit me
i went into a dog's kennel the dog big me and chased me off as though he had been a man
one would have said that he knew who i was
i went into the fields intending to sleep in the open air beneath the stars
there were no stars
i thought it was going to rain and i reentered the town to seek the recess of a doorway
yonder in the square i meant to sleep on a stone bench
a good woman pointed out your house time and said to me' knock there
' i have knocked
what is this place
do you keep an inn
i have money savings
one hundred and nine france fifteen sous which learned in the galleys by my labor in the course of nineteen years
i will pay
what is that time
i have money
i am very weary twelve leagues on foot i am very hungry
are you willing that i should remain
madame magloire said the bishop you will set another place
the man advanced three paces and approached the lamp which was on the table
stop he resumed as though he had not quite understood that's not it
did you hear
i am a galley slaves convict
i come from the galleys
he drew from his pocket a large sheet of yellow paper which he unfolded
here's my passport
yellow as you see
this serves to expel me from every place where i go
will you read it
i know how to read
i learned in the galleys
there is a school there for those who choose to learn
hold this is what they put on this passport' jean valjean discharged convict native of' that is nothing to you' has been nineteen years in the galleys five years for housebreaking and burglary fourteen years for having attempted to escape on four occasions
he is a very dangerous man
' there
everyone has cast me out
are you willing to receive me
is this an inn
will you give me something to eat and a bed
have you a stable
madame magloire said the bishop you will put white sheets on the bed in the alcove
we have already explained the character of the two women's obedience
madame magloire retired to execute these orders
the bishop turned to the man
sit down air and warm yourself
we are going to sup in a few moments and your bed will be prepared while you are sipping
at this point the man suddenly comprehended
the expression of his face up to that time somber and harsh bore the in print of style faction of doubt of joy and became extraordinary
he began stammering like a crazy man really
what
you will keep me
you do not drive me north
a convict
you call me air
you do not address msac thou
' get out of here you do g
' is what people always say home
i felt sure that you would expel me so i told you at once who i am
oh what a good woman that was who directed or higher
i am going to sup
a bed with a mattress and sheets like the rest of the world
a bed
it is nineteen years since i have slept in a bed
you actually do not want me to go
you are good people
besides i have money
i will pay well
pardon me monsieur the innkeeper but what is your name
i will pay anything you ask
you are a fine man
you are an innkeeper are you not
i am replied the bishop a priest who lives here
a priest
said the man
oh what a fine priest
then you are not going to demand any money of me
you are the cure are you not
the cure of this big church
well
i am a fool truly
i had not perceived your skull cap
as he spoke he deposited his knapsack and his cudgel in a corner replaced his passport in his pocket and seated himself
mademoiselle baptist one based mildly at him
he continued you are humane monsieur le sure you have not scorned me
a good priest is a very good thing
then you do not require me to pay
no. said the bishop keep your money
how much have you
did you not tell me one hundred and nine france
and fifteen sous added the man
one hundred and mike france fifteen sous
and how long did it take you to earn that
nineteen years
nineteen years
the bishop sighed deeply
the man continued i have still the whole of my money
in four days i have spent only twenty five sous which i earned by helping unload some wagons at grasse
since you are an abbe i will tell you that we had a chaplain in the galleys
and one day i saw a bishop there
monseigneur is what they call him
he was the bishop of ma more at marseilles
he is the cure who ruled over the other cures you understand
pardon me i say that very badly but it is such a far off thing to me
you understand what we are
he said mass in the middle of the valleys on an altar
he had a pointed thing made of gold on his head of glittered in the bright light of midday
we were all ranged in lines on the three sides with cannons with lighted matches facing us
we could not see very well
he spoke but he was too far off and we did not hear
that is what a bishop is like
while he was speaking the bishop had gone and shut the door which had remained wide open
madame magloire returned
she brought a silver form and spoon which she placed on the table
madame magloire said the bishop place those things as near the fire as possible
and turning to his guest the night wind is harsh on the alps
you must be colds or
each time that he uttered the words or in his voice which was so gently grave and polished the man's face lighted up
monsieur to a convict is like a glass of water to one of the shipwrecked of the medusa
ignominy thirsts for consideration
this lamp gives a very bad light said the bishop
madame magloire understood him and went to get the two silver candlesticks from the chimney piece in monseigneur's bedchamber and placed them lighted on the table
monsieur le cure said the man you are good you do not despise me
you receive me into your house
you light your candles for me
yet i have not concealed from you whence i come and that i am an unfortunate man
the bishop who was sitting close to him gently touched his hand
you could not help telling me who you were
this is not my house it is the house of jesus christ
this door does not demand of him who enters whether he has a name but whether he has a brief
you suffer you are hungry and thirsty you are welcome
and do not thank me do not say that i receive you in my house
no one is at home here except the man who needs a refuge
i say to you who are passing by that you are much more at home here than i am myself
everything here is yours
what need gavel to know your name
besides before you told me you had one which i knew
the man opened his eyes in astonishment
really
you knew what i was called
yes replied the bishop you are called my brother
stop monsieur le cure exclaimed the man
i was very hungry when i entered here but you are so good that i no longer know what has happened to me
the bishop looked at him and said you have suffered much
on the red coat the ball on the ankle a plank to sleep on heat cold took the convicts the thrashing's the double chain for nothing the cell for one word even sick and in bed still the chain
dogs dogs are happier
nineteen years
i am forth six
now there is the yellow passport
that is what it is like
yes resumed the bishop you have come from a very sad place
listen
there will be more joy in heaven over the year bathed face of a repentant signed than over the white robes of a hundred just men
if you emerge from that saw place with thoughts of hatred and of wrath against mankind you are deserving of pity if you emerge with thoughts of goodwill and of peace you are more worthy than any one of us
in the meantime madame magloire had served supper soup made with water oil bread and salt a little gas on a bit of mutton find a fresh cheese and a large load of the bread
she had of her own accord added to the bishop's ordinary care a bottle of his old mauve swine
the bishop's race at once assumed that expression of gayety which is peculiar to hospitable natures
to table
he cried vivaciously
as was his custom when a stranger supper with him he made them and it on his right
mademoiselle baptist one perfectly peaceable and natural took her seat at his left
the bishop asked a blessing then helped the soup himself according to his custom
the man began to eat with avidity
all at once the bishop said it strikes me there is something missing on this table
madame magloire had in fact only placed the three sets of forms and spoons which were absolutely necessary
now it was the usage of the house when the bishop has anyone to supper to lay out the whole six sets of silver on the tablecloth an innocent ostentation
this graceful semblance of luxury was a kind of child's play which was full of charm in that gentle and severe household which raised poverty into dignity
madame magloire understood the remark went out without saying a word and a moment later the three sets of silver forms and spoons demanded by the bishop were glittering upon the cloth symmetrically arranged before the three persons seated at the table
chapter iv details concerning the cheese fairies of ponta flier
now in order to convey an idea of what passed at that table we can not do better than to transcribe here a passage from one of mademoiselle baptist one's letters to madame void chevron wherein the conversation between the convict and the bishop is described with ingenious minute news
this man paid no attention to anyone
he ate with the for a city of a starving man
however after supper he said' monsieur le cure of the good for all this is far too good for me but i must say that the carter's who would not allow me to eat with them keep a better table than you do
' between ourselves the remark rather shocked me
my brother replied' they are more fatigued than i
'' n o' returned the man' they have more money
you are poor i see that plainly
you can not be even a curate
are you really a cure
a hit the good god were but just you certainly ought to be a cure
'' the good god is more than just' said my brother
a moment later he added' monsieur jean valjean is it to pintar life that you are going
'' with my road marked out for me
' i think that is what the man said
then he went on' i must be on my way by daybreak tomorrow
travelling is hard
if the nights are sold the days are not
'' you are going to a good country's aid my brother
' during the revolution my family was ruined
i took refuge in franche context first and there i lived for some time by the toil of my hands
my will saw good
i found plenty to occupy me
one has only to choose
there are paper mills tanneries distilleries oil factories watch factories on a large scale steel mills copperworks twenty iron foundries at least four of which situated at low sat chatillon at aid in court and at heure are tolerably large
' i think i am not mistaken in saying that those are the names which my brother mentioned
then he interrupted himself and addressed me' have we got some relatives in those parts my dear sister
' i replied' we did have some among others m
we live net who was captain of the gates at pintar lied under the old regime
'' yes' resumed my brother' by tim' one had no longer any relatives one had only one's arms
i worked
they have in the country of ponta flier whither you are going monsieur valjean a truly patriarchal and truly charming industry my sister
it is their cheese fairies which they call fruit is rss
' then my brother while urging the man to eat explained to him with great minute news what these fruit keres of ponta flier were that they were divided into two classes the big barns which belong to the rich and where there are forty or fifty cows which produce from seven to eight thousand cheeses each summer and the associated fruit is rss which belong to the poor these are the peasants of mid mountain who hold their cows in common and share the proceeds
' they engage the services of a cheese maker whom they call the true in the true in receives the milk of the associates three times a day and marks the quantity in a double tally
it is towards the end of april that the work of the cheese dairies begins it is towards the middle of june that the cheese makers drive their vows to the mountains
' the man recovered how animation as he ate
my brother made him drink that food mauve swine which he does not drink himself because he says that wine is expensive
my brother imparted all these details with that easy gayety of his with which you are acquainted interspersing his words with graceful attention's home
he recurred frequently to that comfortable tradeoff turin as though he wished the man to understand without advising him directly and harshly that this would afford him a refuge
one thing struck me
this man was what i have told you
well neither during supper nor during the entire evening did my brother utter a single word with the exception of a few words about jesus when he entered which could remind the man of what he was not of what my brother was
to all appearances it was an occasion for preaching him a little sermon and of impressing the bishop on the convict so that a mark of the passage might remain behind
this might have appeared to anyone else who had this unfortunate man in his hands to afford a chance to nourish his soul as well as his body and to bestow upon him some reproach seasoned with moralizing and advice or a little commiseration with an exhortation to conduct himself better in the future
my brother did not even ask him from what country became not what was his history
for in his history there is a fault and my brother seemed to avoid everything which could remind him of it
to such a point did he carry it that stone time when my brother was speaking of the mountaineers of pintar life who exercise a gentle labor near heaven and who he added are happy because they are innocent he stopped short fearing lest in this remark there might have escaped him something which might sound the man
by dint of reflection i think i have comprehended what was passing in my brother's heart
he was thinking no doubt that this man whose name is jean valjean had his misfortune only too vividly present in his mind that the best things as to divert him from it and to make him believe it only momentarily that he was a person like any other by treating him just in his ordinary way
is not this indeed to understand charity well
is there not dear madame something truly evangelical in this delicacy which abstains from sermon from moralizing from allusions
and is not the truest pity when a man has a sore point not to touch it at all
it has seemed to me that this might have been my brother's private thought
in any case what i can say is that if he entertained all these ideas he gave no sign of them from beginning to end even to me he was the same as he is every evening and he's upper with this jean valjean with the same air and in the same manner in which he would have supped with m
gedeon le provost or with the curate of the parish
towards the end when he had reached the first here came a knock at the door
it was not yet her baud with her little one in her arms
my brother missed the child on the brow and borrowed fifteen sous which i had about me to give him other herbs us
the man was not paying much need to anything then
he was no longer talking and he seemed very much fatigued
after poor old get baud had taken her departure my brother said grace then he turned to the man and said to him' you must be in great need of your bed
' madame magloire cleared the table very promptly
i understood that we must retire in order to allow this travelled to go to sleep and we both went upstairs
nevertheless i sent madame magloire down a moment later to carry to the man's bed a goat skin from the black forest which was in my room
the nights are frigid and that keeps one warm
it is a pity that this skin i sold all the hair is falling out
my brother bought it while he was in germany at fort lingen near the sources of the danube as well as the little ivory handled knife which i use at table
madame magloire returned immediately
we said our prayers in the drawing room where we hang up the linen and then we each retired to our own chambers without saying a word to each other
chapter v tranquillity after nodding his sister good night monseigneur bienvenu took one of the two silver candlesticks from the table handed the other to his guest and said to him monsieur i will conduct you to your room
then an followed him
as might have been observed from what has been said above the house was so arranged that in order to pass into the oratory where the alcove was situated or to get out of it it was necessary to traverse the bishop's bedroom
at the moment when he was crossing this apartment madame magloire was putting away the silverware in the cupboard near the head of the new
this was her last care every evening before she went to bed
the bishop installed his guest in the alcove
a fresh white bed had been prepared there
the man set the candle down on a small table
sell said the bishop may you pass a good night
tomorrow morning before you set out you shall drink a cup of warm milk from our cows
thanks monsieurl' abbe said the man
hardly had he pronounced these words full of peace when all of a sudden and without transition he made a strange movement which would have frozen the two sainted women with horror had they witnessed it
even at this day it is difficult for us to explain what inspired him at that moment
did he intend to convey a warning or to throw out a menace
was he simply obeying a sort of instinctive impulse which was obscure even to him weir
he turned abruptly to the old man folded his arms and n ending upon his host a savage gaze he exclaimed in a hoarse voice am
really
you lodge me in your house close to yourself like this
he broke off and added with a laugh in which there lurked something monstrous have you really reflected well
how do you know that i have not been an assassin
the bishop replied that is the concern of the good god
then gravely and moving his lips like one who is praying or talking to himself he raised two fingers of his right hand and he showed his benediction on the man who did not bow and without turning his head of looking behind him he returned to his bedroom
when the alcove was in use a large serve curtain drawn from wall to wall concealed the altar
the bishop knelt before this curtain as he passed and said a brief prayer
a moment later he was in his garden walking meditating contemplating his heart and soul wholly absorbed in those grand and mysterious things which god shoes at night to the eyes which remain open
as for the man he was actually do fatigued that he did not even profit by the nice white sheets
snuffing out his candle with his nostrils after the manner of convicts he dropped all dressed as he was upon the bed where he immediately fell into a profound sleep
midnight struck as the bishop returned from his garden to his apartment
a few minutes later all were asleep in the little house
chapter vi jean valjean towards the middle of the night jean valjean woke
jean valjean came from a poor peasant family of brie
he had not learned to read on his childhood
when he reached man's estate he became a tree pruners trader miles
his mother was named jeanne mathieu his father was called jean valjean or via jean probably a sobriquet and a contraction of villa is an here's jean
jean valjean was of that thoughtful but not gloomy disposition which constitutes the peculiarity of affectionate natures
on the whole however there was something decidedly sluggish and insignificant about jean valjean in appearance at least
he had lost his father and mother at a very early age
his mother had died of a milk fever which has not been properly attended to
his father agree pruner like himself had been killed by a fall from a tree
all that remained to jean valjean was a sister older than himself a widow with seven children boys and girls
this sister had brought up jean valjean and so long as she had a husband she lodged and fed her young brother
the husband died
the eldest of the seven children's as eight years old
the youngest one
jean valjean had just attained his twenty fifth year
he took the father's place and in his turn supported the sister who had brought him up
this was done simply as a duty and even a little churlish lyon the part of jean valjean
thus his youth had been spent in rude and ill paid tool
he had never known a kind woman friend in his native parts
he had not had the time to fall in love
he returned at night weary and ate his broth without uttering a word
his sister mother jeanne often took the best part of his repast from his bowl while he was eating a bit of me at a slice of bacon the heart of the cabbage to give to one of her children
as he went on eating with his head bent over the table and almost into his soul his long hair falling about his bowl and concealing his eyes he had the air of perceiving nothing and allowing it
there was a trade rolled not far from the valjean thatched cottage on the other side of the lane a farmer's wife named marie claire the valjean children habitually famished sometimes went to borrow from marie claire a pint of milk in their mother's name which they drank behind a hedge or in some alley corner snatching the jun from each other so hastily that the little girls spilled it on their aprons and down their necks
if their mother had known of this marauding she would have punished the delinquents severely
jean valjean gruffly and grumbling of paid marie claire for the pint of milk behind their mother's back and the children were not punished
in pruning season he earned eighteen sousa day then he hired out as a haymaker as laborers and a thereon a farm as a drudge
he did whatever he could
his sister worked also but what could she do with seven little children
it was a sad group enveloped in misery which was being gradually annihilated
a very hard winter came
jean had no work
the family had no bread
no bread literally
seven children
one sunday evening maybe this a beau the naked on the church square at face rolled was preparing to go to bed when he heard a violent blow on the grated front of his shop
he arrived in time to see an arm passed through a hopf made by a blow from a fist through the grating and the glass
the arms fixed a loaf of bread and carried it off
is a beau ran out in haste the robber fled at the full speed of his legs
usage sudan after him and stopped him
the thief had flung away the load but his arm was still bleeding
it was jean valjean
this took place in
jean valjean was taken before the tribunals of the time for theft and breaking and entering an inhabited house at night
he had a gun which he used better than anyone else in the world he was a bit of a poacher and this injured his case
there exists a legitimate prejudice against poachers
the poacher like the smugglers mac os too strongly of the brigand
nevertheless we will remark cursor ily there is still an abyss between these races of men and the hideous assassin of the towns
the poacher lives in the forest the smuggler lives in the mountains or on the sea
the cities make ferocious men because they make corrupt men
the mountain the sea the forest make savage men they develop the fierce side but often without destroying the humane side
jean valjean was pronounced guilty
the terms of the code were explicit
there occur formidable hours in our civilization there are moments when the penal laws decree a shipwreck
what an ominous minute is that in which society draws back and consummated the irreparable abandonment of a sentient being
jean valjean was condemned to five years in the galleys
on the dog april the victory of monte not he won by the general in chief of the army of italy whom the message of the directory to the five hundred of the diffl' oreal year iv
calls buona parte was announced in paris on that same day a great gang of galley slaves was put in chains at bu cette
jean valjean formed a part of that gang
an old turnkey of the prison who is now nearly eighty years old still recall's perfectly that unfortunate wretch who was chained to the end of the fourth line in the north angle of the courtyard
he was seated on the ground like the others
he did not seem to comprehend his position except that it was horrible
it is probable that he also was disentangling from amid the vague ideas of a poor man ignorant of everything something excessive
while the bolt of his iron collar was being riveted behind his head with heavy blows from the hammer he wept his tears stifled him they impeded his speech he only managed to say from time to time i was a tree pruner at face rolled
then still sobbing he raised his right hand and lowered it gradually seven times as though he were touching in succession seven heads of unequal heights and from this gesture it was divined that the thing which he had done whatever it was he had done for the sake of clothing and nourishing seven little children
he set out for toulon
he arrived there after a journey of twenty seven days on a cart with a chain in his neck
at toulon he was clothed in the red cassock
all that has constituted his life even to his name was effaced he was no longer even jean valjean he was number
what became of his sister
what became of the seven children
who troubled himself about that
what becomes of the handful of leaves from the young tree which is sawed off at the root
it is always the same story
these poor living beings these creatures of god henceforth without support without guide without refuge wandered away at random who even knows
each in his own direction perhaps and little by little buried themselves in that cold most which engulfs solitary destinies gloomy shades into which disappear in succession so many unlucky heads in the sombre march of the human race
they quitted the country
the clock tower of what had been their village forgot them the boundary line of what had been their field forgot them after a few years' residence in the galleys jean valjean himself forgot them
if that heart where there had been a wound there was a scar
that is all
only once during all the time which he spent at toulon did he hear his sister mentioned
this happened i think towards the end of the fourth year of his captivity
i know nor through what channels the news reached him
someone who had known them in their own country had seen his sister
she was in paris
she lived in a poor street rear saint sulpice in the rue du vin dre
she had with her only one child a little boy the youngest
where were the other six
perhaps she did not know herself
every morning she went to a printing office no
rue du sabot where she was a folder and stitcher
she was obliged to be there at sixo'clock in the morning long before daylight in winter
in the same building with the printing office there was a school and to this school she took her little boy who was seven years old
but as she entered the printing office at six and the school only opened at seven the child had to wait in the courtyard for the school to open for an hour one hour of a winter night in the open air
they would not allow the child to come into the printing office because he was in the way they said
when the workmen passed in the morning they beheld this poor little being seated on the pavement overcome with drowsiness and often fast asleep in the shadow crouched down and doubled up over his basket
when it rained an old woman the port read took pity on him she took him into her den where there was a pallet a spinning wheel and two wooden chairs and the little ones lumbered in a corner pressing himself close to the cat that he might suffer less from cold
at seveno'clock the school opened and he entered
that is what was told to jean valjean
they talked to him about it for one day it was a moment a flash as though a window had suddenly been opened up on the destiny of those things whom he had loved them all closed again
he heard nothing more forever
nothing from them ever reached him again he never be held them he never met them again and in the continuation of this mournful history they will not be met with any more
towards the end of this fourth year jean valjean's turn to escape arrived
his comrades assisted him as is the custom in that sad place
he escaped
he wandered for two days in the fields at liberty of being at liberty is to be hunted to turn the head every instant to quake at the slightest noise to be afraid of everything of a smoking glob of a passing man of a barking dog of a galloping horse of a striking click of the day because one can see if the night because one can not see if the highway of the path of a bush of sleep
on the evening of the second day he was captured
he had neither eaten not slept for thirty six hours
the maritime tribunal condemned him for this crime to a prolongation of his term for three years which made eight years
in the sixth year his turn to escape occurred again be availed himself of it but could not accomplish his flight fully
he was missing at roll call
the cannon were fired and at night the patrol found him hidden under the keel of a vessel in process of construction he resisted the valley guards who seized him
escape and rebellion
this case provided for by a special code was punished by an addition of five years two of them in the double chain
thirteen years
in the tenth year his turn came round again he again profited by it he succeeded no better
three years for this fresh attempt
sixteen years
finally i think it was during his thirteenth year he made a last attempt and only succeeded in getting're taken at the end of four hours of absence
three years for those four hours
nineteen years
in october he was released he had entered therein for having broken a pane of glass and taken a loaf of bread
room for a brief patent jesus
this is the second time during his studies on the penal question and damnation by law that the author of this book has come across the theft of a list of bread as the point of departure for the disaster of a destiny
claude the us had stolen a loaf jean valjean had stolen a loaf
english statistics prove the fact that fourth sets out of five in london have hunger for their immediate cause
jean valjean had entered the galleys sobbing and shuddering he emerged impassive
he had entered in despair he emerged gloomy
what had taken place in that soul
chapter vii the interior of despair let us try to say it
it is necessary that society should look at these things because it is itself which creates them
he was as we have said an ignorant man but he was not a fool
the light of nature was ignited in him
unhappiness which also possesses a clearness of vision of its own augmented the small amount of daylight which existed in this none
beneath the cudgel beneath the chain in the cell in hardship beneath the burning sun if the galleys upon the plank bed of the convict he withdrew into his own consciousness and meditated
he constituted himself the tribunal
he began by putting himself on trial
he recognized the fact that he was not an innocent man unjustly punished
he admitted that he had committed an extreme and blameworthy act that that loaf of bread would probably not have been refused to him had he asked for it that in any case it would have been better to wait until he could get it through compassion or through work that it is not an unanswerable argument to say can one wait when one is hungry
that in the first place it is very rare for anyone to die of hunger literally and near that fortunately or unfortunately man is sox institut de that he can suffer long and much both morally and physically without dying that it is therefore necessary to have patience that that would even have been better for those poor little children that it had been an act of madness for him a miserable unfortunate wretch to take society at large violently by the collar and to imagine that one can escape from misery through theft that that is in any case a poor door through which to escape from misery through which infamy enters in short that he was in the wrong
then he asked himself whether he had been the only one in fault in his fatal history
whether it was not a serious thing that he a laborer out of work that he an industrious man should have lacked bread
and whether the fault once committed and confessed the chastisement had not been ferocious and did proportioned
whether there had not been more abuse on the part of the law in respect to the penalty than there had been on the part of the culprit in respect to his fault
whether there had not been an excess of weights in one balance of the scale in the one which contains expiation
whether the overweight of the penalty was not equivalent to the annihilation of the crime and did not result in reversing the situation of replacing the fault of the delinquent by the fault of the repression of converting the guilty man into the victim and the debtor into the creditor and of ranging the law definitely on the side of the man who had violated it
whether this penalty complicated by successive aggravations for attempts at escape had not ended in becoming a sort of outrage perpetrated by the stronger upon the feeble ra crime of society against the individuals crime which was being committed a fresh every day a crime which had lasted nineteen years
he asked himself whether human society could have the right to force its members to suffer equally in one case for its own unreasonable lack of foresight and in the other case for its pitiless foresight and to seize a poor man forever between a defect and an excess a default of work and an excess of punishment
whether it was not outrageous for society to treat this precisely those of its members who were the least well endowed in the division of goods made by chance and consequently the most deserving of consideration
these questions put and answered he judged society and condemned it
he condemned it to his hatred
he made it responsible for the fate which he was suffering and he said to himself that it might be that one day he should not hesitate to call it to account
he declared to himself that there was no equilibrium between the harm which he had caused and the harm which was being done to him he finally arrived at the conclusion that his punishment was not in truth unjust but that it most assuredly was iniquitous
anger may be both foolish and absurd one can be irritated wrongfully one is exasperated only when there is some show of right on one's side at bottom
jean valjean felt himself exasperated
and besides human society had done him nothing but harm he had never seen anything of its ave that angry face which it calls justice and which it shows to those whom it strikes
men had only touched him to bruise hum
every contact with them had been a blow
never since his infancy since the days of his mother of his sister had he ever encountered a friendly word and a kindly glance
from suffering to suffering he had gradually arrived at the conviction that life is a war and that in this war he was the conquered
he had no other weapon than his hate
he resolved to whet it in the valleys and to hear it away with him when he departed
there was at toulon a school for the convicts kept by the ignorant in friars where the most necessary branches were taught to those of the unfortunate men who had a mind for them
he was of the number who had a mind
he went to school at the age of forty and learned to read to write to cipher
he felt that to fortify his intelligence was to fortify his hate
in certain cases education and enlightenment can serve to eke out evil
this is a sad thing to say after having judged society which had caused his unhappiness be judged providence which had made society and he condemned it also
thus during nineteen years of torture and slavery this soul mounted and at the same time fell
light entered it on one side and darkness of the other
jean valjean had not as we have seen an evil nature
he was still good when he arrived at the galleys
get here condemned society and felt that he was becoming wicker be there condemned providence and was conscious that he was becoming impious
it is difficult not to indulge in meditation at this point
does human nature thus change utterly and from top to bottom
can the man created good by god be rendered wicked by man
can the soul be completely made over by date and become evil rate being evil
can the heart become misshapen and contract incurable decor nities and infirmities under the oppression of ad is proportionate unhappiness as the vertebral column beneath follow a vault
is there not in every human soul was there not in the soul of jean valjean in particular a first spark a divine element incorruptible in this world immortal in the other which good can develop can ignite and make to glow with splendor and which evil can never wholly extinguish
grave and obscure questions to the last of which every physiologist would probably have responded no and that without hesitation had he be held at toulon during the hours of repose which were for jean valjean hours of're very this gloomy galley slaves faced with folded arms upon the bar of some capstan with the end of his chain thrust into his pocket to prevent its dragging serious silent and thoughtful a parish of the laws which regarded the man with wrath condemned by civilization and regarding heaven with severity
certainly and we make no attempt to die simulate the fact the observing physiologist would have beheld an irremediable misery he would perchance have pitied this sick man of the law's making but he would not have even essayed any treatment he would have turned aside his gaze from the caverns of which he would have caught a glimpse within this soup and liked and eat the portals of hell he would have effaced from this existence the word which the finger of god has nevertheless inscribed upon the brow of every man hope
was this state of his soul which we have attempted to analyze as perfectly clear to jean valjean as we have tried to render it for those who read us
did jean valjean distinctly perceive after their formation and had he seen distinctly during the process of their formation all the elements of which his moral misery was composed
had this rough and unlettered man gathered a perfectly clear perception of the succession of ideas through which he had by degrees mounted and descended to the lugubrious aspects which had for so many years formed the inner horizon of his spirit
waste conscious of all that passed within him and of all that was working there
that is something which we do not presume to a rate it is something which we do not even believe
there was too much ignorance in jean valjean even after his misfortune to prevent much vagueness from still lingering there
a thing she did not rightly know himself what he felt
jean valjean was in the shadows he suffered in the shadows he hated in the shadows one might have said that he hated in advance of himself
he dwelt habitually in this shadow feeling his way like a blind man and a dreamer
only at intervals there suddenly came to him from without and from within an access of wrath a surcharge of suffering alicia and rapid flash which illuminated his whole soul and caused to appear abruptly all around him in front behind amid the gleams of a frightful light the hideous precipices and the sombre perspective of his destiny
the flash passed the night closed in again and where was us
if no longer knew
the peculiarity of pains of this nature in which that which is pitiless that is to say that which is brutalizing predominates is to transform a man little by little by a sort of stupid transfiguration into a wild beast sometimes into a ferocious beast
jean valjean's successive and obstinate attempts at escape would alone suffice to prove this strange working of the law upon the human soul
jean valjean would have renewed these attempts utterly useless and foolish as they were as often as the opportunity has presented itself without reflecting for an instant on the result nor on the experiences which he had already gone through
he escaped impetuously like the wolf who finds his cage open
instinct said to him flee
reason would have said remain
but in the presence of so violent a temptation reason vanished nothing remained but instinct
the beast alone acted
when he was recaptured the fresh severities inflicted on him only served to render him still more wild
one detail which we must not on it is that he possessed a physical strength which was not approached by a single one of the denizens of the galleys
at work at paying out a cable or winding up a capstan jean valjean was worth four men
he sometimes lifted and sustained enormous weights on his back and when the occasion demanded it be replaced that implement which is called a jack screw and was formerly called orgy will ride whence we may remark in passing is derived the name of the rue mon for the linear the halles fish market in paris
his comrades had nicknamed him mean the jack's crew
once when they were repairing the balcony of the town hall at toulon one of those admirable carya tide of puget which support the balcony bed and loosened and was on the point of falling
jean valjean who was present supported the cary a tie with his shoulder and gave the workmen time to arrive
his suppleness even exceeded his strength
certain convicts who were forever dreaming of escape ended by making a veritable science of force and skill combined
it is the science of muscles
an entire system of mysterious statics is daily practised by prisoners men who are forever envious of the flies and birds
to climb a vertical surface and to find point q of support where hardly a projection was visible was play to jean valjean
an angle of the wall being given with the tension of his back and legs with his elbows and his heels fitted into the unevenness of the stone he raised himself as if by magic to the third story
he sometimes mounted thus even to the roof of the galley prison
he spoke but little
he laughed not at all
an excessive emotion was required to wring from him once or twice a year that lugubrious laugh or the convict which is like the echo of the laugh of a demon
to all appearance he seemed to be occupied in the constant contemplation of something terrible
he was absorbed in fact
athwart the unhealthy perceptions of an incomplete nature and a crushes intelligence he was confused it conscious that some monstrous thing was resting on him
in that obscure and wan shadow within which he crawled each time that he turned his neck and essayed to raise his glance he perceived with terror mingled with rage a sort of frightful accumulation of things collecting and mounting above him beyond the range of his vision laws prejudices men and deeds whose outlines escaped him whose mass terrified him and which was nothing else than that prodigious pyramid which we call civilization
he distinguished here and there in that swarming and formless mass now near him now afar off and on inaccessible tablelands some group some detail vividly illuminated here the valley sergeant and his cudgel there the gendarme and his sword yonder the mitted archbishop away at the top like a sort of sun the emperor crowned and dazzling
it seemed to him that these distant splendors far from dissipating his night rendered it more funereal and more black
all this laws prejudices deeds men things went and came above him over his head in accordance with the complicated and mysterious movement which god imparts to civil ization walking over him and crushing him with i know not what peacefulness in its cruelty and i yes or ability in its indifference
souls which have fallen to the bottom of all possible misfortune unhappy men lost in the lowest of those limbo sat which no one any longer looks there proved of the law feel the whole weight of this human society so formidable for him who is without so frightful for him who is beneath resting upon their heads
in this situation jean valjean meditated and what could be the nature of his meditation
if the grain of millet beneath the millstone has thoughts it would doubtless think that same thing which jean valjean thought
all these things realities full of spectres phantasm stories full of realities had eventually created for him a sort of interior state which is almost indescribable
at times amid his conduct toll he paused
he fell to thinking
his reason at one and the same time roper and more troubled than of yore rose in revolt
everything which had happened to him seemed to him absurd everything that surrounded him seemed to him impossible
he said to himself it is a dream
he gazed at the valley sergeant standing a few paces from him the valley sergeant seemed a phantom to him
all of a sudden the phantom wealth in a blow with his cudgel
visible nature hardly existed for him
it would almost be true to say that there existed for jean valjean neither sun not find summer days nor radiant sign of fresh april dawns
i know not what vent hole daylight habitually illumined his soul
to sum up in conclusion that which can be summed up and translated into positive results in all that we have just pointed out we will confine ourselves to the statement that in the course of nineteen years jean valjean the inoffensive fred l. diner of fave rolled the formidable convict of toulon had become capable thanks to the manner in which the galleys had moulded him of two sorts of evil action firstly of evil action which was rapid in premeditated dashing entirely instinctive in the nature of reprisals for the evil which he had undergone secondly of evil action which was serious grave consciously argued out and premeditated with the false ideas which such a misfortune can furnish
his deliberate deeds passed through three successive phases which natures of a certain stamp can alone traverse reasoning will perseverance
he had for moving causes his habitual death bitterness of soul a profound sense of indignities suffered the reaction even against the good the innocent and the just if there are any such
the point of departure like the point of arrival for all his thoughts was hatred of human law that hatred which if it be not arrested in its development by come providential incident becomes within a given time the hatred of society then the hatred of the human race then the hatred of creation and which manifests itself by a vague incessant and brutal desire to do harm to some living being no matter whom
it will be perceived that it was not without reason that jean valjean's passport described him as a very dangerous man
from year to hear this soul had dried away slowly but with fatal sureness
when the heart is dry the eye is dry
on his departure from the galleys it had been nineteen years since he had shed a year
chapter viii billows and shadows a man overboard
what matters it
the vessel does not halt
the wind blows
that sombre ship has a path which it is forced to pursue
it passes on
the man disappears then reappears he plunged he rises again to the surface he calls he stretches out his arms he is not heard
the vessel trembling under the hurricane is wholly absorbed in its own workings the passengers and sailors do not even see the drowning man his miserable head is but a speck amid the immensity of the waves
he gives vent to desperate cries from out of the depths
what a spectre is that retreating sail
he gazed and gazes at it frantically
it retreats it grows do not diminished in size
he was the debug just now he was one of the crew he went and came along the deck with the rest he had his part of breath and of sunlight he was a living man
now what has taken place
he has slipped he has fallen all is at an end
he is in the tremendous sea
underfoot he has nothing but what else's and crumbles
the bill is storm and lashed by the wind encompass him hideously the tossing's of the abyss bear him away all the tongues of water wash over his head a populace of wages spots upon him confused openings half devour him every time that he sinks he catches glimpses of precipices filled with night frightful and unknown vegetation's seize him knot about his feet draw him to them he is conscious that he is becoming an abyss that he forms part of the foam the waves toss him from one to another he drinks in the bitterness the cowardly ocean attacks him furiously to drown him the enormity plays with his agony
it seems as though all that water were hate
nevertheless he struggles
he tries to defend himself he tries to sustain himself he makes an effort he swims
he his perth strength all exhausted instantly combats the inexhaustible
where the nis the ship
yonder
barely visible in the pale shadows of the horizon
the wind blows in gusts all the foam overwhelms him
he raises his eyes and he holds only the livid ness of the clouds
he witnessed a mid his death pangs the immense madness of the sea
he is tortured by this madness he heard noises strange to man which seem to come from behind the limits of the earth and from one knows not what frightful region beyond
there are birds in the clouds just as there are angels above human distresses but what can they do for him
they sing and fly and float and hehe rattles in the death agony
he feels himself buried in those two infiniti fx the ocean and the sky at one and the same time the one is a tomb the other is a shroud
night descend she has been swimming for hours his strength is exhausted that ship that distant thing in which there were men had vanished he is alone in the formidable twilight gulf he sinks he stiffens himself he twists himself he feels under him them in stroud billows of the invisible he shouts
there are no more men
where is god
he shouts
help
help
he still shouts in
nothing on the horizon nothing in heaven
he implored the expanse the waves the seaweed the reef they are deaf
genesee she's the tempest the imperturbable tempest of eye only the infinite
around him darkness for solitude the stormy and non sentient tumult the undefined curling of those wild waters
in him horror and fatigue
beneath him the depths
not a point of support
he thinks of the gloomy adventures of the corpse in the limitless shadow
the bottomless cold paralyzes him
his hands contract con bul sively they close and grasp nothingness
winds clouds whirlwinds gusts useless stars
what is to be done
the desperate man gives up he is weary he chooses the alternative of death he resists not he lets himself to us abandons his grip and then he tossed for evermore in the lugubrious dreary depths of engulf ment
oh implacable march of human societies
oh losses of men and of souls on the way
ocean into which falls all that the law let's slip
disastrous absence of help
oh moral death
the sea is the inexorable social night into which the penal laws doing their condemned
the sea is the immensity of wretchedness
the soul going downstream in this gulf may become a corpse
who shall resuscitate it
chapter ix new troubles when the hour came for him to take his departure from the galleys when jean valjean heard in his dad the strange words thou art free
the moment seemed improbable and unprecedented a day of vivid light a day of the true light of the living suddenly penetrated within him
but it was not long before this day paled
jean valjean had been dazzled by the idea of liberty
he had believed in a new life
he very speedily perceived what sort of liberty it is to which a yellow passport is provided
and this was encompassed with much bitterness
he had calculated that his earnings during his sojourn in the valley sought to amount to a hundred and seventy one france
it is but just to add that he had forgotten to include in his calculations the forced repose of sundays and festival days during nineteen years which entailed a diminution of about eighty france
at all events his board had been reduced by various local levies to the sum of one hundred and nine francs fifteen sous which had been counted out to him on his departure
he had understood nothing of this and had thought himself wronged
let us say the word robbed
on the day following his liberation he saw at grease in front of an orange flower distillery some men engaged in unloading bales
he offered his services
business was pressing they were accepted
he set to work
he was intelligent robust adroit he did his best the master seemed pleased
while he was at works gendarme passed observed him and demanded his papers
it was necessary to show him the yellow passport
that done jean valjean resumed his labor
a little while before he had questioned one of the workmen as to the amount which they earned each day at this occupation he had been told thirty sous
when evening arrived as he was forced to set out again on the following day he presented himself to the owner of the distillery and requested to be paid
the owner did not utter a word but handed him fifteen sous
he objected
he was told that is enough for the e
he persisted
the master looked him straight between the eyes and said to him beware of the prison
there again be considered that he had been robbed
society the state by diminish in this board had robbed him wholesale
now it was the individual who was sobbing him at retail
liberation is not deliverance
one gets free from the galleys but not from the sentence
that is what happened to him at grasse
we have seen on what manner he was received a tech alters the man aroused as the cathedral clock struck two in the morning jean valjean awoke
what woke him was that his bed was too good
it was nearly twenty years since he had slept in a bed and although he had not increased the sensation was too novel not to disturb his slumbers
he had slept more than four hours
his fatigue had passed away
he was accustomed not to devote many hours to repose
he opened his eyes and stared into the gloom which surrounded him then he closed them again with the intention of going to sleep once more
when many varied sensations have agitated the day when various matters preoccupy the mind one falls asleep once but not a second time
sleep comes more easily than it returns
this is what happened to jean valjean
he could not get to sleep again and he fell to thinking
he was at one of those moments when the thoughts which one has in one's mind are troubled
there was a sort of dark confusion in his brain
his memories of the olden time and of the immediate present floated there pell hell and mingled confusedly losing their proper forms becoming did proportionately large then suddenly disappearing as in a muddy and perturbed pool
many thoughts occurred to him but there was one which kept constantly presenting itself a fresh and which drove away all others
we will mention this thought at once he had observed the six sets of silver forms and spoons and the ladle which madame magloire had placed on the table
those six sets of silver haunted him
they were there
a few paces distant
just as he was traversing the adjoining room to reach the one in which he then was the old servant woman had been in the act of placing them in a little cupboard near the head of the bed
he had taken careful note of this cupboard
on the right as you entered from the dining room
they were solid
and old silver
from the lab of one could get at least two hundred francs
double what he had earned in nineteen years
it is true that he would have earned more of the administration had not robbed him
his mind wavered for a whole hour in fluctuations with which there was certainly mingled some struggle
threeo'clock struck
he opened his eyes again drew himself up abruptly into a sitting posture stretched out his arm and felt of his knapsack which he had thrown down on a corner of the alcove then he hung his legs over the edge of the bed and placed his feet on the floor and thus found himself almost without knowing it seated on his bed
he remained for a time thoughtfully in this attitude which would have been suggestive of something sinister for anyone who had seen him thus in the dark the only person awake in that house where all were sleeping
all of a sudden he stooped down removed his shoes and placed them softly on them at beside the bed then he resumed his thoughtful attitude and became motionless once more
throughout this hideous meditation the thoughts which we have above indicated moved incessantly through his brain entered withdrew reentered and in a manner oppressed him and then he thought also without knowing why and with the mechanical persistence of revert of a convict named brevet whom he had known in the galleys and whose trousers had been upheld by a single suspended of knitted cotton
the checkered pattern of that suspended recurred incessantly to his mind
he remained in this situation and would have so remained in definitely even until daybreak had not the clock struck one the half or quarter hour
it seemed to him that that stroke said tom income of
he rose to his feet hesitated still another moment and listened all was quiet in the house then he walked straight ahead with short steps to the window of which he caught a glimpse
the night was not very dark there was a full moon across which courses large clouds driven by the wind
this created outdoors alternate shadow and gleams of light eclipses they bright openings of the clouds and indoors a sort of twilight
this twilight sufficient to enable a person to see his way intermittent on account of the clouds resembled the sort of logic light which falls through an air hole in a cellar before which the passers by come and co
on arriving at the window jean valjean examined it
it had not eating it opened in the garden and was fastened according to the fashion of the country only by a small pin
he opened it but as a rush of cold and piercing air penetrated the room abruptly he closed it again immediately
be scrutinized the garden with that attentive base which studies rather than looks
the garden was enclosed by a tolerably low white wall easy to climb
far away at the extremity he perceived tops of trees spaced at regular intervals which indicated that the wall separated the garden from an avenue of land planted with trees
having taken this survey he executed a movement like that of a man who has made up his mind strode to his also be grasped his knapsack opened in fumbled in it pulled out of it something which he placed on the bed put his shoes into one of his pockets shut the whole thing up again threw the knapsack on his shoulders put on his cap drew the visordown over his eyes felt for his cudgel went and placed it in the angle of the window then returned to the bed and resolutely seized the object which he had deposited there
it resembled a short bar of iron pointed like spike at one end
it would have been difficult to distinguish in that darkness for what employment that bit of iron could have been designed
perhaps it was a lever possibly it was a club
in the daytime it would have been possible to recognize it as nothing more than a miner's candlestick
convicts were at that period sometimes employed in quarrying stone from the lofty hills which environ toulon and it was not rate for them to have miners' tools at their command
these miners' candlesticks are of massive iron terminated at the lower extremity by a point by means of which they are stuck into the rock
he took the candlestick in his right hand holding his breath and trying to deaden the sound of his tread he directed his steps to the door of the adjoining room occupied by the bishop as we already know
on arriving at this door he found it a jar
the bishop had not closed it
chapter xi what he does jean valjean listened
not a sound
he gave the doors push
he pushed it gently with the top of his finger lightly with the furtive and uneasy gentleness of a cat which is desirous of entering
the door yielded to this pressure and made an imperceptible and silent movement which enlarged the opening a little
he waited a moment then gave the door a second and an older push
it continued to yield in silence
the opening was now large enough to allow him to pass
but near the door there stood a little table which formed an embarrassing angle with it and barred the entrance
jean valjean recognized the difficulty
it was necessary at any cost to enlarge the aperture still further
he decided on his course of action and gave the door a third push more energetic than the two preceding
this time a badly oiled hinge suddenly thu the dam is the silence a hoarse and prolonged cry
jean valjean shuddered
the noise of the hinge rang in his ears with something of the piercing and formidable sound of the trump of the day of iucn menu
in the fantastic exaggerations of the first moment he almost imagined that that hinge had just become animated and had suddenly assumed a terrible live and that it was barking like a dog to arouse everyone and earn and to wake those who were asleep
he halted shuddering bewildered and fell back from the tips of his toes upon his heels
he heard the arteries in his temples beating like two forge hammers and it seemed to him that his breath issued from his breast with the roar of the wind issuing from a cavern
it seemed impossible to him that the horrible clamor of that irritated hinge should not have disturbed the entire household like the shock of an earthquake the door pushed by jim had taken the alarm and had shouted the old man would rise at once the two old women would shriek our people would come to their assistance in less than a quarter of an hour the town would be in an uproar and the gendarmerie on hand
for a moment he thought himself list
he remained where he was petrified like the statue of salt not daring to make a movement
several minutes elapsed
the door had fallen wide open
he ventured to peek into the next room
nothing had stirred there
he lent a near
nothing was moving in the house
the noise made by the rush things had not awakened anyone
this first danger was last but there still reigned a frightful tumult within him
nevertheless he did not retreat
even when he had thought himself lost he had not drawn back
his only thought now was to finish as soon as possible
he took a step and entered the room
this room was in a state of perfect calm
here and there vague and confused forms were distinguishable which in the daylight were papers scattered on a table plan folios volumes piled upon a stool an armchair heaped with clothing apr ie dick and which at that your we're only shadowy corners and whitish spots
jean valjean advanced with precaution taking care not to knock against the furniture
he could hear at the extremity of the room the even and tranquil breathing of the sleeping bishop
he suddenly came to a halt
he was near the bed
he had a eroded there sooner than he had thought for
nature sometimes mingles her effects and her spectacles with our actions with sombre and intelligent appropriate news as though she desired to make us reflect
for the last half hour a large cloud had covered the heavens
at the moment when jean valjean paused in front of the best his cloud parted as though on purpose and a day or light traversing the long window suddenly illuminated the bishop's pale face
he was sleeping peacefully
he lay in his bed almost completely dressed on account of the cold if the bases calls in a garment of brown wool which covered his arms to the wrists
his head was thrown back on the pillow in the careless attitude of repose his hand adorned with the pastoral ring and whence had fallen so many good deeds and so many holy actions was hanging over the edge of the bed
his whole face was illumined with a vague expression of satisfaction of hope and on felicity
it was more than a smile and almost a radiance
before upon his brow the indescribable reflection of a light which was invisible
the soul of the just contemplated in sleep a mysterious heaven
a reflection of that heaven rested on the bishop
it was at the same time a luminous transparency for that heaven was within him
that heaven was his conscience
illustration the fall b. the fall at the moment when the day of moonlight superposed itself so to speak up on that inward radiance the sleeping bishop seemed as in a glory
it remained however gentle and veiled in an ineffable half light
that moon in the sky that slumbering nature that garden without aquifer that house which was so calm the hour the moment the silence added some solemn and unspeakable quality to the venerable repose of this man and enveloped in a sort of serene and majestic aureole that white hair those closed eyes that face in which all was hope and all was confidence that head of an old man and that slumber of an infant
there was something almost divine in this man who was thus august without being himself aware of it
jean valjean was in the shadow and stood motionless with his iron candle stick in his hand frightened by this luminous old man
never had he beheld anything like this
this confidence terrified him
the moral world has no grander spectacle than this a troubled and uneasy conscience which has arrived on the brink of an evil action comreg playing the slumber of the just
that slumber in that isolation and with a neighbor like himself had about it something sublime of which he was vaguely but imperiously conscious
no one could have told what was passing within him not even himself
in order to attempt to form an idea of it it is necessary to think of the most violent of things in the presence of the most gentle
even on his visage it would have been impossible to distinguish anything with certainty
it was a sort of haggard astonishment
he gazed at it and that was all
but what was his thought
it would have been impossible to divine it
what was evident was that he was touched and astounded
but what was the nature of this emotion
his eye never quitted the old man
the only thing which was clearly to be inferred from his attitude and his physiognomy was a strange indecision
one would have said that he was hesitating between the two abysses the one in which one loses one's self and that in which one saves one's self
he seemed prepared to crush that skull or to kiss that hand
at the expiration of a few minutes his left arm rose slowly towards his brow and he took off his cap then his arm fell back with the same deliberation and jean valjean fell to meditating once more his cap in his left hand his club in his right hand his hair bristling all over his savage head
the bishop continued to sleep in profound peace beneath that terrifying gaze
the gleam of the moon rendered confusedly visible the crucifix over the chimney piece which seemed to be extending its arms to both of them with a benediction for one and pardon for the other
suddenly jean valjean replaced his cap on his brow then stepped rapidly past the bed without glancing at the bishop straight to the cupboard which he saw me at the head he raised his iron candle stick as though to force the lock the key was there he opened it the first thing which presented itself to him was the basket of silverware he seized it traverses the chamber with long strides without taking any precautions and without troubling himself about the noise gained the door reentered the oratory opened the window seized his cudgel best rode the windowsill of the ground floor put the silver into his knapsack threw away the basket crossed the garden leaped over the wall like a tiger and fled
chapter xii the bishop works the next morning at sunrise monseigneur bienvenu was strolling in his garden
madame magloire ran up to him in utter consternation
monseigneur monseigneur
she exclaimed does your grace know where the basket of silver is
yes replied the bishop
jesus the lord be blessed
she resumed i did not know what had become of it
the bishop had just picked up the basket in a flower bed
he presented it to madame magloire
here it is
well
said she
nothing in it
and the silver
at returned the bishop so it is the silver which troubles you
idon't know where it is
great good god
it is stolen
that man who was here last night had stolen it
in a twinkling with all the vivacity of an alert old woman madame magloire had rushed to the oratory entered the alcove and returned to the bishop
the bishop had just bent down and was signing as he examined a plant of cochlear ia des full line which the basket had broken as it fell across the bed
he rose up at madame magloire's cry
monseigneur the man is gone
the silver has been stolen
as she uttered this exclamation her eyes fell upon a corner of the garden where traces of the wall having been scaled were via unit
the coping of the wall had been torn away
stay
yonder is the way he went
he jumped over into focus file to an e
at the abomination
he has stolen our silver
the bishop remained silent for a moment then he raised his grave eyes and said gently to madame magloire and in the first place was that silver ours
madame magloire was speechless
another silence ensued then the bishop went on madame magloire i have for a long time detained that silver wrongfully
it belonged to the poor
who was that man
a poor man evidently
alas
jesus
returned madame magloire
it is not for my sake not for mademoiselle's
it makes no difference to us
but it is for the sake of monseigneur
what is monseigneur to eat with now
the bishop gaze father with an air of amazement
at some
are there no such things as pewter forms and spoons
madame magloire shrugged her shoulders
pewter has an odor
iron forms and spoons then
madame magloire made an expressive grimace
iron has a taste
very well said the bishop wooden ones then
a few moments later he was breakfast inn at the very table at which jean valjean had sat on the previous evening
as heard his breakfast monseigneur welcome remarked gayly to his sister who said nothing and to madame magloire who was grumbling under her breath that one really does not need either form or spoon even of wood in order to dip a bit of bread in a cup of milk
a pretty idea truly said madame magloire to herself as she went and came to take in a man like that
and to lodge him close to one's self
and how fortunate that he did nothing but steal
at mon dieu
it makes one shudder to think of it
as the brother and sister were about to rise from the table there came a knock at the door
come in said the bishop
the door opened
a singular and violent group made its appearance on the threshold
three men were holding a fourth man by the collar
the three men were gendarmes the other was jean valjean
a brigadier of gendarmes who seemed to be in command of the group was standing near the door
he entered and advanced to the bishop making a military salute
monseigneur said he
at this word jean valjean who was rejected and seemed overwhelmed raised his head with an air of st. up fraction
monseigneur
he murmured
so he is not the cure
silence
said the gendarme
he is monseigneur the bishop
in the meantime monseigneur bienvenu had advanced as quickly as his great are permitted
ah
here you are
he exclaimed looking at jean valjean
i am glad to see you
well but how is this
i have you the candlesticks too which are of silver like the rest and for which you can certainly get two hundred francs
why did you not carry them away with your forks and spoons
jean valjean opened his eyes wide and stared at the venerable bishop with an expression which no human tongue can render any account of
monseigneur said the brigadier of gendarmes so what this man said is true then
we came across him
he was walking like a man who is running away
we stopped him to look into the matter
he had this silver and he told you interposed the bishop with a smile that it had been given to him by a kind old fellow of a priest with whom he had passed the night
i see how the matter stands
and you have brought him back here
it is a mistake
in that case replied the brigadier we can let him go
certainly replied the bishop
the gendarmes released jean valjean who recoiled
is it true that i am to be released
he said in an almost inarticulate voice and as though he were talking in his sleep
yes thou art released dost thou not understand
said one of the gendarmes
my friend resumed the bishop before you go here are your candlesticks
take them
he stepped to the chimney piece took the two silver candlesticks and brought them to jean valjean
the two women looked on without uttering a word without a gesture without a look which could die concert the bishop
jean valjean was trembling in every limb
he took the two candlesticks mechanically and with a bewildered air
now said the bishop go in peace
by the way when you return my friend it is not necessary to pass through the garden
you can always enter and depart through the street door
it is never fastened with anything but a patch either by day or by night
then turning to the gendarmes you may retire gentlemen
the gendarmes retired
jean valjean was like a man on the point of fainting
the bishop drew near to him and said in a low voice do not forget never forget that you have promised to use this money in becoming an honest man
jean valjean who had no recollection of ever having promised anything remained speechless
the bishop had emphasized the words when he uttered them
he resumed with solemnity jean valjean my brother you no longer belong to evil but to good
it is your soul that i buy from you i withdraw it from black thoughts and the spirit of perdition and i give it to god
chapter xiii little gervais jean valjean left the town as though he were fleeing from it
he set out at a very tasty pace through the fields taking whatever roads and paths presented themselves to him without perceiving that he was incessant life tracing his steps
he wandered thus the whole morning without having eaten anything and without feeling hungry
he was the prey of a throng of novel sensations
he was conscious of a sort of date he did not know against whom it was directed
he could not have told whether he was touched or humiliated
there came over him at moments a strange emotion which he resisted and to which he opposed the hardness acquired during the last twenty years of his life
this state of mind fatigued him
he perceived with dismay that the sort of frightful calm which the injustice of his misfortune had conferred upon him was giving way within him
he asked himself what would replace this
at times he would have actually preferred to be in prison with the gendarmes and that things should not have happened in this way it would have agitated him less
although the season was tolerably far advanced there were still a few late flowers in the hedgerows here and there whose odor as he passed through them in his march recalled to him memories of his childhood
these memories were almost intolerable to him it was so long since they had recurred to jim
unutterable thoughts assembled within him in this manner all day long
as the sun declined to its setting casting long shadows athwart the soil from every pebble jean valjean sat down behind a bush upon a large ruddy plain which was absolutely deserted
there was nothing on the horizon except the alps
not even the spire of a distant village
jean valjean might have been three leagues distant from's a path which intersected the plain passed a few paces from the bush
in the middle of this meditation which would have contributed not a little to render his days terrifying to anyone who might have encountered him a joyous sound became audible
he turned his head and saw a little savoyard about ten years of age coming up the path and singing his hurdy gurdy on his hip and his marmot fox on his back
one of those gay and gentle children who go from land to land affording a view of their knees through the holes in their trousers
without stopping missing the law halted in his march from time to time and played at knuckle bones with some coins which he had in his hand his whole fortune probably
among this money there was one for the ou piece
the child halted beside the bush with our perceiving jean valjean and tossed up his handful of sous which up to that time he had caught with a good deal of adroit news on the back of his hand
this time the forty so i piece escaped him and went rolling towards the brushwood until it reached jean valjean
jean valjean set his foot upon it
in the meantime the child had looked after his coin and had caught sight of him
he showed no astonishment but walked straight up to the man
the spot was absolutely solitary
as far as the eye could see there was not a person on the plain or in the path
the only sound was the tiny feeble cried of a flock of birds of passage which was traversing the heavens at an immense height
the child was standing with his back to the son which cast threads of gold in his hair and em purples with its blood red gleam the savage face of jean valjean
sue said the little savoyard with that childish confidence which is composed of ignorance and innocence my money
what is your name
said jean valjean
little gervais sud
go away said jean valjean
sir resumed the child give me back my money
jean valjean dropped his head and made no reply
the child began again my money air
jean valjean's eyes remained fixed on the earth
my piece of money
cried the child my white piece
my silver
it seemed as though jean valjean did not hear him
the child grasped him by the collar of his blouse and shook him
at the same time he made an effort to displace the big iron shod shoe which rested on his treasure
i want my piece of money
my piece of forty sous
the child wept
jean valjean raised his head
he still remained seated
his eyes were troubled
he gazed at the child in a sort of amazement then he stretched out his hand towards his cudgel and cried in a terrible voice who's there
is it replied the child
little gervais
i
give me back my god by sous if you please
take your foot away air if you please
then irritated though he was so small and becoming almost menacing come now will you take your foot away
take your foot away or we'll see
ah
it's still you
said jean valjean and rising abruptly to his feet his foot stool resting on the silver piece he added will you take yourself off
the frightened child looked at him then began to tremble from head to foot and after a few moments of stupor he set out running at the top of his speed without daring to turn his neck or to utter a cry
nevertheless lack of breath forced him to halt after a certain distance and jean valjean heard him sobbing in the midst of his own're very
at the end of a few moments the child had disappeared
the sun had set
the shadows were descending around jean valjean
he had eaten nothing all day it is probable that he was feverish
he had remain as standing and had not changed his attitude after the child's flight
the breath headed his chest at long and irregular intervals
his gaze fixed ten or twelve paces in front of him seemed to be scrutinizing with profound attention the shape of an ancient fragment of blue earthenware which had fallen in the grass
all at once he shivered he had just begun to feel the chill of evening
he settled his cap more firmly on his brow sought mechanically to cross and button his blouse advanced a step and stopped to pick up his cudgel
at that moment he caught sight of the forty so i piece which his foot had half ground into the earth and which was shining among the pebbles
it was as though he has received a galvanic stock
what is this
he muttered between his teeth
here coiled three laces then halted without being able to detach his gaze from the spot which his foot had trodden but an instant before as though the thing which lay glittering there in the gloom had been an open eye riveted upon him
at the expiration of a few moments he darted convulsively towards the silver coin seized it and straightened himself up again and began to gaze afar off over the plain at the same time casting his eyes towards all points of the horizon as he stood there erect and shivering like a terrified wild animal which is seeking refuge
he saw nothing
night was calling the plain was cold and vague great banks of violet haze were rising in the gleam of the twilight
he said am
and set out rapidly in the direction in which the child had disappeared
after about thirty pace she paused looked about him and saw nothing
then he shouted with all his might little gervais
little gervais
he paused and waited
there was no reply
the landscape was gloomy and deserted
he was encompassed by space
there was nothing around him but an obscurity in which his gaze was lost and a silence which engulfed his voice
an icy north wind was blowing and imparted to things around him a sort of lugubrious life
the bushes shook their thin little arms with incredible fury
one would have said that they were threatening and pursuing someone
he set out on his march again then he began to run and from time to time he halted and shouted into that solitude with a voice which was the most formidable and the most disconsolate that it was possible to hear little gervais
little gervais
assuredly of the child had heard him he would have been alarmed and would have taken goods are not to show himself
but the child was no doubt already far away
he encountered a priest on horseback
he stepped up to him and said monsieur le fire have you seen a child pass
nl said the priest
one named little gervais
i have seen no one
he drew two five franc pieces from his money bag and handed them to the priest
monsieur le cure this is for your poor people
monsieur le sure he was a little lad about ten year sold with an admit i think and a hurdy gurdy
one of those savoyard's you know
i have not seen him
little gervais
there are no villages here
can you tell me
if he is like what you say my friend he is a little stranger
such persons pass through these parts
we know nothing of them
jean valjean seized two more coins office brands each with violence and gave them to the priest
for your poor he said
then he added wildly monsieur o' abbe have me arrested
i am a thief
the priest put spurs to his horse and fled in haste much alarmed
jean valjean set out on a run in the direction which he had first taken
in this way he traversed a tolerably long distance gazing calling shouting by the metro one
two or three times he ran across the plain towards something which conveyed to him the effect of a human being declining or crouching down it turned out to be nothing but brushwood or rocks nearly on a level with the earth
at length at a spot where three paths intersected each other he stopped
the moon had risen
he sent his gaze into the distance and shouted for the last time little gervais
little gervais
little gervais
his shout died away in the most without even awakening an echo
he murmured yet once more little gervais
but in a feeble and almost inarticulate voice
it was his last effort his legs gave way abruptly under him as though an invisible power had suddenly overwhelmed him with the weight of his evil conscience he fell exhausted on a large stone his fists clenched in his hair and his face on his knees and he cried i am a wretch
then his heart burst and he began to cry
it was the first time that he had wept in nineteen years
when jean valjean left the bishop's house he was as we have seen quite thrown out of everything that had been his thought hitherto
he could not yield to the evidence of what was going on within him
he hardened himself against the angelic action and the gentle words of the old man
you have promised me to become an honest man
i buy your soul
i take it away from the spirit of perversity i give it to the good god
this recurred to his mind unceasingly
to this celestial kindness he opposed pride which is the fortress of evil within us
he was indistinctly conscious that the pardon of this priest was the greatest assault and the most formidable artsci which had moved him yet that his occur act was finally settled if he resisted this clemency that if he yielded he should be obliged to renounce that hatred with which the actions of other men had filled his soul through so many years and which pleased him that this time it was necessary to conqueror to be conquered and that a struggle a colossal and final struggle had been begun between his viciousness and the goodness of that man
in the presence of these lights he proceeded like a man who is intoxicated
as he walked this with haggard eyes did he have a distinct perception of what might result to him from his adventures td
did he understand all those mysterious murmurs which warn of import une the spirit at cereal n moments of life
did a voice whisper in his ear that he had just passed the solemn hour of his destiny that there no longer remained a middle course for him that if he were not henceforth the best of men he would be the worst that it behooves him now so to speak to mount higher than the bishop or call lower than the convict that if he wished to become good he must become an angel that if he wished to remain evil he must become a monster
here again some questions must be put which we have already put to ourselves elsewhere did he catch some shadow of all this in his thought in a confused way
misfortune certainly as we have said does form the education of the intelligence nevertheless it is doubtful whether jean valjean was in a condition to disentangle all that we have here indicated
if these ideas occurred to him he but caught glimpses of rather than saw them and they only succeeded in throwing him into an unutterable and almost painful state of emotion
on emerging from that black and deformed thing which is called the galleys the bishop had hurt his soul as too vivid a light would have hurt his eyes in emerging from the dark
the future life the possible life which offered itself to him henceforth all pure and radiant filled him with the more and anxiety
he no longer knew where he really was
like an owl who should suddenly see the sunrise the convict has been dazzled and blinded as it were by virtue
that which was certain that which he did not doubt was that he was no longer the same man that everything about him was changed that it was no longer in his power to make it as though the bishop had not spoken to him and had not touched him
in this state of mind he had encountered little gervais and had robbed him of his forty sous
why
he certainly could not have explained it was this the last effect and the supreme effort as it were of the evil thoughts which he had brought away from the galleys a remnant of impulse a result of what is called in statics acquired force
it was that and it was also perhaps even less than that
let us say it simply it was not he who stole it was not the man it was the beast who by habit and instinct had simply placed his foot upon that money while the intelligence was struggling amid so many novel and hitherto unheard of thoughts be setting it
when intelligence reawakened and be held that action of the brute jean valjean recoiled with anguish and uttered a cry of terror
illustration awakened b awakened it was because strange phenomenon and one which was possible only in the situation in which he found himself in stealing the money from that child he had done a thing if which he was no longer capable
however that maybe this last evil action had a decisive effect on him it abruptly traversed that chaos which he bore in his mind and dispersed it placed on one side the thick obscurity and on the other the light and acted on his soul in the state in which it then was as certain chemical reagents act upon a troubled mixture by precipitating one element and clarifying the other
first of all even before examining himself and reflecting all bewildered like one who seeks to save himself he tried to find the child in order to return his money to him then when he recognized the fact that this was impossible he halted in despair
at the moment when he exclaimed i am a wretch
he had just perceived what he was and he was already separated from himself to such a degree that he seemed to himself to be no longer anything more than a phantom and as if he had there before him in flesh and blood the hideous valley convict jean valjean cudgel in hand his blouse on his hips his knapsack filled with stolen objects on his back with his resolute and gloomy visage with his thoughts filled with abominable projects
excess of unhappiness had as we have remarked made him in some sort a visionary
this then was in the nature of a vision
he actually saw that jean valjean that sinister face before him
he had almost reached the point of asking himself who that man was and he was horrified by him
his brain was going through one of those violent and yet perfectly calm moments in which're very is so profound that it absorbs reality
one no longer be holds the object which one has before one and one sees as though apart from one's self the figures which one has in one's own mind
thus he contemplated himself so to speak face to face and at the same time athwart this hallucination he perceived in a mysterious depths sort of light which he at first took for a torch
on scrutinizing this light which appeared to his conscience with more attention he recognized the fact that it possessed a human form and that this torch was the bishop
his conscience weighed in turn these two men thus placed before in the bishop and jean valjean
nothing less than the first was required to soften the second
by one of those singular effects which are peculiar to this sort of ecstasies in proportion as his're very continued as the bishop grew great and resplendent in his eyes so did jean valjean grow less and vanish
after a certain time he was no longer anything more than a shade
all at once he disappeared
the bishop alone remained be filled the whole soul of this wretched man with a magnificent radiance
jean valjean wept for a long time
he wept burning heat she sobbed with more weakness than a woman with more fright than a child
as he wept daylight penetrated more and more clearly into his soul an extraordinary lights light at once ravishing and terrible
his past life his first fault his long expiation his external britishness his internal hardness his dismissal to liberty rejoicing in manifold plans of vengeance what had happened to him at the bishop's the last thing that he had done that theft of forty sous from a child a crime all the more cowardly and all the more monstrous since it had come after the bishop's pardon all this recurred to his mind and appeared clearly to him but with a clearness which he had never hitherto witnessed
he examined his life and it seemed horrible to him his soul and it seemed frightful to him
in the meantime a gentle light tested over this life and this soul
it seemed to him that he beheld satan by the light of paradise
how many hours dishes depth us
what did he do after he had wept
whither did he go
no one ever knew
the only thing which seems to be authenticated us that that same night the carrier who served grenoble at that epoch and who arrived at d about threeo'clock in the morning saw as he traverses the street in which the bishop's residence was situated a man in the attitude of prayer kneeling on the pavement in the shadow in front of the door of monseigneur welcome

this is what floats up confusedly pell kell for the year and is now forgotten
history neglects nearly all these particulars and can not do otherwise the infinity would overwhelm it
nevertheless these details which are wrongly called trivial there are no trivial facts in humanity nor little leaves in vegetation are useful
it is of the physiognomy of the years that the physiognomy of the centuries is composed
in this year of four young parisians arranged a fine farce
chapter ii a double quartette these parisians came one from toulouse another from limoges the third from cahors and the fourth from montauban but they were students and when one says student one says parisian to study in paris is to be born in paris
these young men were insignificant everyone has seen such faces four specimens of humanity taken at random neither good nor bad be otherwise not ignorant neither geniuses not fool's handsome with that charming april which is called twenty years
they were four oscars for at that epoch arthurs did not yet exist
burn for him the perfumes of araby
exclaimed romance
oscar advances
oscar i shall be told him
people had just emerged from ossian elegance was scandinavian and caledonian the pure english style was only to prevail later and the first of the arthur's wellington had but just won the battle of waterloo
these oscars bore the names one of felix thilo my eq of toulouse the second list o life of canoes the next faneuil of limoges the last bla chevelle of montauban
naturally each of them had his mistress
bla chevelle loved favourite so named because she had been in england pistol is favored dahlia who had taken for her nickname the name of a flower faneuil idolized se phone an abridgment of josephine tho i oh yes haddam to be called the blonde because of her beautiful sunny hair
favourite dahlias ephone and fan time were four ravishing young women perfumes and radiant still a little like working women and not yet entirely divorced from their needles somewhat disturbed by intrigues but still retaining on their faces something of the serenity of toil and in their souls that flower of honesty which survives the first fall in woman
one of the four was called the young because she was the youngest of them and one was called the old the old one was twenty three
not to conceal anything the three first were more experienced more heedless and more emancipated into the tumult of life than can find the blonde who was still in her first illusions
dahlias ephone and especially favourite could not have said as much
there is fair easy been more than one episode in their romance though hardly begun and the lover who had borne the name of a dolphin the first chapter had turned out to be alphonse in the second and gustave in the third
poverty and coquet ry are two fatal counsellors ones colds and the other flatters and the beautiful daughters of the people have both of them whispering in the idea reach on its own side
these badly guarded souls listen
hence the falls which they accomplish and the stones which are thrown at them
they are overwhelmed with splendor of all that is immaculate and inaccessible
alas
what if the jungfrau were hungry
favourite having been in england was admired by dahlia and ze phone
she has had an establishment of her own very early in life
her father was an old unmarried professor of mathematics a brutal man and a braggart who went out to give lessons in spite of his age
this professor when he was a young man had one day seen a chambermaid's gown catch on a fender he had fallen in love in consequence of this accident
the result has been favourite
she met her father from time to time and he bowed to her
one morning an old woman with the air of a devotee had entered her apartments and has said to her you do not know me make noise lle
no
i am your mother
then the old woman opened the sideboard and ate and drank had a mattress which she owned brought in and installed herself
this cross and pious old mother never spoke to favourite remained hours without uttering a word breakfasted diner and supper for four and went down to the porter's quarters for company where she spoke ill of her daughter
it was having rosy nails that were too pretty which had drawn dahlia to list plied to others perhaps to idleness
how could shemale such nails work
she who wishes to remain virtuous must not have pity on her hands
as for zep time she had conquered game jul by her roguish and caressing little way of saying yes sir
the young men were comrades the young girls were friends
such lives are always accompanied by such friendships
goodness and philosophy are two distinct things the proof of this is that after making all due allowances for these little irregular households favourites ephone and dahlia were philosophical young women who levantine was a good girl
good
someone will exclaim and tho i oh yes
solomon would reply that love forms a part of wisdom
we will confine ourselves to saying that the love off an times as a first love a sole love a faithful love
steal one of all the four was not called though a single one of them
fan time was one of those beings who blossom so to speak from the dregs of the people
though she had emerged from the most unfathomable depths of social shadow she bore on her brow the sign of the anonymous and the unknown
she was born atm
shrm
of what parents
who can say
she had never known father or mother
she was called fan time
why can give
she had never borne any other name
at the epoch of her birth the directory still existed
she had no family names he had no family no. baptismal name the church no longer existed
she bore the name which pleased the first random passerby who had encountered her when a very small child running bare legged in the street
she received the name as she received the water from the clouds upon her brow when it rained
she was called little fan time
no one knew more than that
this human creature had entered life in just this way
at the age offend anyone quitted the town and went to service with some farmers in the neighborhood
at fifteen she came to paris to seek her fortune
fan time was beautiful and remained pure as long as she could
she was a lovely blonde with fine teeth
she had good and pearls for her dowry but her gold was on her head and her pearls were in her mouth
she worked for her living then still for the sake of her living for the heart also has its hunger she loved
she loved tho i oh yes
an amour for him passion for her
the streets of the latin quarter filled with throngs of students and g rosettes saw the beginning of their dream
f anyone had long evaded tho i oh yes in the mazes of the bill of the pantheon where so many adventurers twins and in twine but in such a way as constantly to encounter him again
there is a way of avoiding which resembles seeking
in short the ec log he took place
bla chevelle list plier and faneuil formed a sort of group of which tho i oh yes was the head
it was he who possessed the wit
t holon yes was the antique old student he was rich he had an income of four thousand francs four thousand francs
a splendid scandal on mount sainte genevieve
t hill my www as a fast man of thirty and badly preserved
he was wrinkled and toothless and he had the beginning of a bald spot of which he himself said with sadness the skull at thirty the knee at fort j
his digestion was mediocre and he had been attacked by a watering in one eye
but in proportion as his youth disappeared gayety was kindled be replaced his teeth with buf foundries his hair with mirth his health with irony his feeling she laughed incessantly
he was dilapidated but still in flower
his youth which was packing up for departure long before its time beat a retreat in good order bursting with laughter and no one saw anything but fire
he had had a piece rejected at the vaudeville
he made a few verses now and then
in addition to this he doubted everything to the last degree which is a vast force in the eyes of the real
being thus ironical and bald he was the leader
iron is an english word
is it possible that i dont is derived from it
one day tho i oh yes took the three others aside with the gesture of an oracle and said to the mean time dahlia sep time and favourite have been reading is for nearly a year to give them a surprise
we have promised them solemnly that we would
they are forever talking about it to us home in particular just as the old women in naples cry to saint januari us' faccia hi all its two miracoil yellow face perform thy miracle' so our beauties daytime incessantly' t holon yes when will you bring forth tour surprise
' at the same time old parents keep writing to us
pressure on both sides
the moment has arrived it seems home let us discuss the question
thereupon tho i oh yes lowered his voice and articulated something so mirthful that a vast and enthusiastic grin broke out up in the four mouths simultaneously and bla chevelle exclaimed that is an idea
as holy tap room presented itself they entered and the remainder of their confidential colloquy was lost in shadow
the result of these shares was a dazzling pleasure party which took place on thr following sunday the four young men inviting the four young girls
chapter iii four and four it is hard nowadays to picture to one's self what's pleasure trip of students and gross free to the country was like forty five years ago
the suburbs of paris are no longer the same the physiognomy of what may be called circum parisian life has changed completely in the last half century where there was the cuckoo there is the railway car where there was a tender boat there is now the steamboat people speak of decamp nowadays as they spoke of saint cloud in those days
the paris it is a city which has france for its outskirts
the four couples conscientiously sent through with all the country follies possible at that time
the vacation was beginning and it was a warm bright summer day
on the prefer lng day favourite the only one who knew how to write had written the following hot holon yes in the name of the four it is a good hour to emerge from happiness
that is why they rise at fiveo'clock in the morning
then they went to saint cloud by the coach looked at the dry cascade and exclaimed this must be very beautiful when there is water
they breakfasted at the tegen our where cast wing had not yet been they treated themselves to a game if ring throwing under the quincy bx of trees of the grand fountain they ascended diogenes' lantern they gambled for macaroons at the roulette establish many of the pont de sevres picked bouquets who are aux bought reed pipes at neuilly are applet arts everywhere and were perfectly happy
the young girls rustled and charged like warblers escaped from their cage
it was a perfect delirium
from time to time they bestowed little taps on the young men
math final intoxication of life
adorable years

have you rambled through the brush do is holding aside the branches on account of the charming head which is coming on behind you
have you sold laughing down a slope all wet with rain with a beloved woman holding your hand and crying an my new boots
what a state they are in
let us say at once that that merry obstacles shower was lacking in the case of this good humored party although favourite had said as they set out with a magisterial and maternal home the slugs are crawling on the paths a sign of rain children
all four were madly pretty
a good old classic post them famous a good fellow who had an eleonore m
le chevalier de la boy is seas he strolled that day beneath the chestnut trees of saint cloud saw them pass about teno'clock in the morning and exclaimed there is one too many of them as he thought of the graces
favourite bla chevelle's friend the one aged three and twenty the old one raton in front under the great green boughs jumped the ditches stalked distractedly over bushes and presided over this merrymaking with the spirit of a young female faun
sep mind and dahlia whom chance had made beautiful in such a way that they set each off when they were together and completed each other never left each other more from an instinct of co que try that from friendship and clinging to each other they assumed english poses the first keepsakes had just made their appearance melancholy was dawning for women as later on byron own dawned for men and the hair of the tender sex began to droop file fully
sep time and dahlia had their hair dressed in rolls
low to life and faneuil who were engaged in discussing their professors explained tocantins the difference that existed between m
delvin court and h
blonde au
bla chevelle seemed to have been created expressly to carry favourite's single bordered imitation india shawl offer maud's manufacture on his arm on sundays
th plum yes followed dominating the group
he was very gay but one felt the force of government in him there was dictation in his jovial it this principal ornament was a pair of trousers of elephant leg pattern of man keen with straps of braided copper wire he carried as you that tamworth two hundred francs in his hand and as he treated himself to everything a strange thing called a cigar in his mouth
nothing was sacred to him he smoked
that tho i oh yes is astounding
said the others with generation
what trousers
what energy
as for fan time she was a joy to behold
her splendid teeth had evidently received an office from god laughter
she preferred to carry her little hat of sewer straw with its long white strings in her hand rather than on her head
her thick blond hair which was inclined to wave and which easily unfilled and which it was necessary to hasten up incessantly seemed made for the flight of galatea under the willows
her rosy lips babbled enchanting ly
the corners of her mouth voluptuous it turned up as in the antique masks over in one had an air of encouraging the audacious but her long shadow how she's dropped discreetly over the jollity of the lower part of the face as though to call a halt
there was something indescribably harmonious and striking about her entire dress
she wore a town of mauve bare be little reddish brown bus line whose ribbons traced and on her fine white open worked stockings and that sort of muslim spencer a marseilles invention whose names and soya corruption of the words quin seal it pronounced after the cashion of the same biere signifies fine weather heat and midday
the three others less timid as we have already said word low necked dresses without disguise which in summer beneath flower adorned hats are very graceful and enticing buffy the side of these audacious outfits blonde anyone's cane zou with its transparencies its indiscretion and its reticence concealing and displaying a tone and the same time seemed an alluring god's end of decency and the famous court of love presided over by the co comtesse de cette with the sea green eyes would perhaps have awarded the prize for claus try to this can saou in the contest for the prize of modesty
the most ingenious is at times the wisest
this does happen
brilliant if face delicate of profile with eyes of a deep blue heavy kids feet arched and small welch's and ankles admirably formed a white skin which here and there allowed the azure branching of the veins to be seen joya cheek that was young and fresh the robust throat of the juno of aegina a strong and supple nape of the neck shoulders modelled as though by vous you with a voluptuous simple in the middle visible through the muslim a gayety cooled by creaminess sculptural and exquisite such was fan time and beneath these feminine adornments and three ribbons one could divine as gator and in that statues soul
fan time was beautiful without being too conscious of it
those rare dreamer's mysterious priests of the beautiful who silently confront everything with perfection would have caught a glimpse in this little working woman through the transparency of her parisian grace of the ancient sacred euphony
this daughter of the shadows was thoroughbred
she was beautiful in the two ways style and rhythm
style is the form of the ideal rhythm is it's movement
we have said that can tune was not she was also modesty
to an observer who studied her attentively that which breathed from her athwart all the intoxication of her age the season and her love affair was an invincible expression of reserve and modesty
she remained a little astonished
this chaste astonishment is the shade of difference which separates psyche from venus
f anyone had the long white fine fingers of the vestal virgins to stirs the ashes of the sacred fire with a golden pig
although she would have refused nothing got hop oh yes as we shall have more than ample opportunity to see her face in reload was supremely virginal a sort of serious and almost austere dignity suddenly overwhelmed her at certain times and there was nothing more singular and disturbing than to see gayety become so suddenly extinct there and meditation succeed to cheerfulness without any transition state
this sudden and sometimes severely accentuated gravity resembled the disdain of a goddess
her brow her nose her chin presented that equilibrium of outline which is quite distinct from equilibrium of proportion and from which harmony of countenance results in the very characteristic interval which separates the base of the nose from the upper lip she had that imperceptible and charming top damysterious sign of chastity which makes barbero us see all in love with a diana found in the the azure so ciconia
love is a fault code ut
f anyone was innocence floating high over fault
chapter oct holon yes is so merry that he sings a spanish ditty that day was composed of dawn from one end to the other
all nature seemed to be having a holiday and to be laughing
the flower beds of saint cloud perfumed the air the breath of the seine rustled the leaves vaguely the branches testicular ed in the wind bees pillaged the jasmine's a whole bohemia of butterflies swooped down upon the yarrow the clover and the sterile oats in the august park of the king of france there was a lack of vagabonds the birds
the four merry couples mingled with the sun the fields the flowers the trees were resplendent
and in this community of paradise talking singing running dancing chasing butterflies plucking convolvulus setting their pink open work stockings in the tall grass fresh wild without malice all received to some extent the kisses of all with the exception off anyone who was hedged about with that vague resistance others composed of creaminess and wildness and who was in love
you always have a queer look about you said favourite timer
such things are joys
these passages of happy couples are a profound appeal to life and nature and make a caress and light spring forth from everything
there was once a fairy who created the fields and forests expressly for those in love in that eternal hedge school of lovers which is forever beginning a new and which will last as long as there are hedges and scholars
hence the popularity of spring among thinkers
the patrician and the knife grinder the duke and the peer the limb of the law the courtiers and townspeople as they used to say in olden times all are subjects of this fairy
they laugh and hunt and there is in the air the brilliance of an apotheosis what a transfiguration effected by love
notaries' clerks are gods
and the little cries the pursuits through the grass the waist's embraced on the fly those margins which are melodies those adoration's which burst forth in the manner of pronouncing a syllable those cherries torn from one mouth by another all this blazes forth and takes its place among the celestial glories

after breakfast the four couples went to what was then called the king's square to see a newly arrived plant from india whose name escapes our memory at this moment and which at that epoch was attracting all paris to saint cloud
it was a nice and charming shrub with a long stem whose numerous branches bristling and leafless and as fine as threads were covered with a million tiny white rosettes this gave the shrub the air of ahead of hair studded with flowers
there was always an admiring crowd about it
after viewing the shrub full oh yes exclaimed i offer you asses
and having agreed upon a price with the owner of the asses they returned by way of van free and i say
a hissy an incident occurred
the truly national park at that time owned by fourth in the contractor happened to be wide open
they passed the gates visited the manikin anchor its in his grotto tried the mysterious little effects of the famous cabinet of mirrors the wanton trap worthy of a satyr become a millionaire or of the cs get metamorphosed into apr la luz
they had stoutly shaken the swing attached to the two chestnut trees celebrated by the ad here bernie

idon't like to have people put on aids like that muttered favour off with a good deal of acrimony
after leaving the asses there was a fresh delight they crossed the seine in a boat and proceeding from passy on foot they reached the barrier ofl' etoile
they had been up since fiveo'clock that morning as the reader will remember but bag
there is no such thing as fatigue on sunday said favourite on sun say fatigue does not work
about threeo'clock the four couples frightened at their happiness were sliding down the russian mountains a singular edifice which then occupied the heights of beau job and who we undulating line was visible above the trees of the champs elysees
from time to time favourite exclaimed and the surprise
i claim the surprise
patience replied tho i oh yes
chapter vat bombards's the russian mountains having been exhausted they began to think about dinner and the radiant party of eight somewhat weary at last became stranded in bombards's public houses branch establishment which had been set up in the champs elysees by that famous restaurant keeper bomb area whose sign could then be seen in the rue de rivoli near delorme alley
a large but ugly room with an alcove and a bed at the end they had been obliged to put up with this accommodation in view of the sunday crowd two windows whence they could survey beyond the elms the quay and the river a magnificent august sunlight lightly touching the pages two tables upon one of them a triumphant mountain of bouquets mingled with the hats of men and women at the other the four couples seated found a merry confusion of platters dishes glasses and bottles jugs of need mingled with flasks of wine very little order on the table some disorder beneath it they made beneath the table a noise a clatter of the feet that was abominable says moliere
this was the state which the shepherd is to begin at fiveo'clock in the morning had reached at half past four in the afternoon
the sun was setting their appetites were satisfied
the champs elysees filled with sunshine and with people were nothing but light and dust the two things of which glory is composed
the horses of madly those n signing marbles were prancing in a cloud of gold
carriages were going and coming
a squadron of magnificent bodyguards with their clarion sat their head were descending the avenue de neuilly the white flag showing faintly rosy in the setting sun floated over the dome of the tuileries
the place de la concorde which has become the place louis xv
once more was choked with happy promenade r s
many wore the silver fleur de lys suspended from the white date red ribbon which had not yet wholly disappeared from button holes in the year
here and there choruses of little girls three to the wind dam is the passersby who formed into circles and applauded the then celebrated bourbon air which was destined to strike the hundred days with lightning and which had for its refrain rendez nous notre per ever and rendez nous not depere
give us back our father from ghent give us back our father
groups of dwellers in the suburbs in sunday array sometimes even decorated with the fleur de lys like the bourgeois scattered over the large square and the marigny square were playing strings and revolving on the wooden horse so there were engaged in drinking some journeyman printers had on paper caps their laughter was audible
everything was radiant
it was a time of undisputed peace and profound royalist security it was the epoch when a special and private report of chief of police angeles to the king on the subject of the suburbs of paris terminated with these lines taking all things into consideration sure there is nothing to be feared from these people
they are as heedless and as indolent assays
the populace is restless in the provinces it is not in paris
these are very pretty men site
it would take all of two of them to make one of your grenadiers
there is nothing to be feared in the part of the populace of paris the capital
it is remarkable that the statute of this population should have diminished in the last fifty years and the populace of the suburbs is still more puny than at the time of the revolution
it is not dangerous
in short it is an amiable rabble
prefects of the police do not seem impossible that a cat can transform itself into a lion that does happen however and in that lies the miracle wrought by the populace of paris
moreover the cat so despised by count angles possessed the esteem of the republics of old
in their eyes it was liberty incarnate and as though to serve as pendant to the minerva altera of the piraeus there stood on the public square in corinth the colossal bronze figure of a sat
the ingenious police of the restoration be held the populace of paris in foo rose colored a light it is not so much of an amiable rabble as it is thought
the parisian is to the frenchman am at the athenian was to the greek no one sleeps more soundly than he no one is more frankly frivolous and lazy than he no one can better assume the air of forgetfulness let him not be trusted nevertheless he is ready for any sort of cool deed but when there is glory at the end of it he is worthy of admiration in every sort of fury
given in a like he will produce the th of august give him a gun you will have austerlitz
he is napoleon's stay and wanton's resource
us if a question of country he enlists is it a question of liberty he tears up the pavements
beware
his hair filled with wrath is epic his blouse drapes itself like the folds of acyl amy's
take care
he will make of the first guerre net at which comes to hand said one forks
when the hour strikes this man of the faubourg's will grow in stature this little man will arise and his gaze will be terrible and his breath will become a tempest and there will issue forth from that slender chest enough wind god is arrange the folds of the alps
it is thanks to the suburban major paris that the revolution mixed with arms conquers europe
he sings it is his delight
proportion his song to his nature and you will see
as long as he has for refrain nothing but la cat manhole he only overthrows louis xvi
make him sing the marseillaise and he will feed the world
this note jotted down on the margin of angles' report we will return to our four couples
the dinner as we have said was drawing to its close
chapter via chapter in which they adore each other chat at table the chat of love it is as impossible to reproduce one as the other the chat of love is a cloud the chat at table is smoke
faneuil and dahlia were humming
tho long as was drinking
sep mine was laughing fan time smiling list plier blowing a wooden trumpet which he had purchased at saint cloud
favourite based tenderly at bla chevelle and said bla chevelle i adore you
this called forth a question from biz chevelle what would you do favourite if i were to cease to love you
i
cried favourite
ah
do not say that even in jest
if you were to cease to love me i would spring after you i would scratch you i should tend you i would throw you into the water i would have you arrested
bla chevelle smiled with the voluptuous self conceit of a man who is tickled in his self love
favourite resume dues i would scream to the police
am
i should not restrain myself not at all
rabble
bla chevelle threw himself back in his chair in an ecstasy and closed both eyes proudly
dahlia as cheats said on a low voice to favourite amid the uproar so you really idolize him deeply that bla chevelle of yours
i
i detest him replied favourite in the same tone seizing her fork again
he is avaricious
i love the little fellow opposite me in my house
he is very nice that young man do you know him
one can see that he is an actor by profession
i love actors
as soon as he comes in his mother says to him' ah
mon dieu
my peace of mind is gone
there he goes with his shouting
but my dear you are splitting my head
's one goes up today ridden targets to black holes as high as he can mount and there he sets to singing reclaiming how do i know what
so that he can be heard downstairs
he earns twenty sousa day at an attorney's by penning quibbles
he is the son of a former prevent or of saint jacques du haut pas
ah
he is very nice
he idolizes me so that one day when he saw me making batter for some pancakes he said to me'm an sells make your gloves into critters and i will eat them
' if i do not artists who can say such things as that
am
he is very nice
i am in a fair way to go out of my head over that little fellow
nevermind i tell bla chevelle that i adore him how i lie
hey
how i folie
favourite paused and then went on i am sad you see dahlia
it has done nothing but rain all summer the wind irrigate sme the wind does not abate
bla chevelle is very stingy there are hardly any green peas in the market one does not know what to eat
i have the spleen as the english say butter is so dear
and then you see it is horrible here we are dining in a room with age digit and that disgusts me with life

and dahlia exclaimed there is bantine on the point of crying over horses
how can one be such a pitiful cool as that
at that moment favourite folding her arms and throwing her head back looked resolutely qtr to pontes and said come now
the surprise
exactly
the moment has arrived replied tho i oh yes
gentlemen the hour for giving these ladies a surprise has struck
wait for us a moment ladies
it begins with a kiss said bla chevelle
on the broward edt holon yes
each bravely bestowed a kiss on his mistress's brow then all four filed out through the door with their fingers on their lips
favourite clapped her hands on their departure
it is beginning to be amusing already said she
don't be too long murmured fan time we are waiting for you
chapter is a merry end to mirth when the young girls were left alone they leaned two by two on the window sills chatting craning out their heads and talking from one window to the other
they saw the young men emerge from the cafe bombard a seminar m
the latter turned round made signs to them smiled and disappeared in that dusty sunday throng which makes a weekly invasion into the champs elysees
din't belong
cried fan time
what are they going to bring us
said de phone
it will certainly be something pretty said dahlia
formulary said favourite i want it to be of gold
their attention was soon distracted by the movements on the shore of the lake which they could see through the branches of the large trees and which diverted them greatly
it was the hour for the departure of the mail coaches and diligence s
nearly all the stage coaches for the south and west passed through the champs elysees
the majority followed the quay and went through the passy barrier
from moment to moment some huge vehicle painted yellow and black heavily loaded noisily harnessed rendered shapeless by trunks tarpaulins and fall see full of heads which immediately disappeared rushed through the crowd with all the sparks of a forge with dust for smoke and an air of duty grinding the pavements changing all the paving stones into steels
this uproar delighted the young girls
favourite exclaimed what a row
one would say that it was a pile of chains flying away
it chanced that one of these vehicles which they could only see with difficulty through the thick elms halted for a moment then set out against a gallop
this surprised dentine
that's odd
said she
i thought the diligence never stopped
favourite shrugged her shoulders
this fan time is surprising
i am coming to take a look at her out of curiosity
she is dazzled by the simplest things
suppose a case i am a traveller i say to the diligence' i will go on in advance you shall pick me up on the quay as you pass
' the diligence passes sees me halts and takes me
that is done every day
you do not know live my dear
in this manner a certain time elapsed
all at once favourite made's movement like a person who is just waking up
well said she and the surprise
yes by the way joined in dahlia the famous surprise
they are a very long time about it
said fan time
asean time concluded this with the waiter who had served them at dinner entered
he held in his hand something which resembled a letter
what is that
demanded favourite
the waiter replied it is a paper that those gentlemen left for these ladies
why did you not bring it at once
because said the waiter the gentlemen ordered me not to deliver it to the ladies for an hour
favourite snatched the paper from the waiter's hand
it was in fact a letter
shop
said she there is no address but this is what is written on it this is the surprise
she tore the letter open hastily opened it and read she knew how to read our beloved you must know that we have parents
parents you do not know much about such things
they are called fathers and mothers by the civil code which is puerile and honest
now these parents grown these old folks implore us these good men and these food women call us prodigal son's they desire our return and offer to kill valves for us
being virtuous we obey them
at the hour when you read this five fiery horses will be bearing us to our papas and mammas
we are pulling up our stakes as bosquet days
we are going we are gone
we flew in the arms of lafitte and on the wings off willard

mourn for us in haste and replace us with speed

the four young women looked at each other

an hour later when she had returned to her room she wept

book fourth
to confide is sometimes to deliver into a person's power chapter i. one mother meets another mother three was at mont vermeil near paris during the first quarter of this century a sort of cookshop which no longer exists
this cookshop was kept by some people named the barrier husband and wife
it was situated in boulanger lane
over the door there was aboard nailed flag against the wall
upon this board was painted something which resembled a man carrying another man on his back the latter wearing the big gilts paulette sofa general with large silver stars red spots represented blood the rest of the picture consisted of smoke and probably represented a battle
below ran this inscription at the sign of sergeant of waterloo zus argent de waterloo
nothing is more common than a car for a trick at the door of an oct rory
nevertheless the vehicle or to speak more accurately the fragment of a vehicle which encumbered the street in front of the cookshop of the sergeant of waterloo one evening in the spring of would certainly have attracted by its mass the attention of any painter who had passed that way
it was the fore carriage of one of those trucks which are used in wood extracts of country and which serve to transport thick planks and the trunks of trees
this fire carriage was composed of a massive iron axle tree with a pivot into which was fitted a heavy shaft and which was supported by two huge wheels
the whole thing was compact overwhelming and misshapen
it seemed like the gun carriage of an enormous cannon
the guts of the road had bestowed on the wheels the bellies thehun the axle and the shaft a layer of mud a hideous yellowish daub in this tolerably like that with which people are fond of ornament ing cathedrals
the wood was disappearing under mud and the iron beneath rust
under the axle free hung like drapery a huge chain worthy of some goliath of a convict
this chain suggested not the beams which it was it's office to transport but the mastodons and mammoths which it might have served to harness it had the air of the galleys but of cyclops an end superhuman valleys and it seemed to have been detached from some monster
homer would have found polyphemus with it and shakespeare caliban
why was that fire carriage of a truck in that place in the street
in the first place to encumber the street next in order that it might finish the process of rusting
there is a throng of institutions in the old social order which one comes across in this fashion as one walks about outdoors and which have no other reasons for existence than the above
the centre of the chain swung very near the ground in the middle and in the loop as in the role of a swing there were seated and grouped on that particular evening in exquisite interlace ment two little girl's one about two years and a half old the other eighteen months the younger in the arms of the other
a handkerchief cleverly knotted about them prevented their falling out
a mother had caught sight of that frightful chain and had said some
there's a plaything for my children
the two children who were dressed prettily and with some elegance were radiant with pleasure one would have said that they were two roses amid old iron their eyes were a triumph their fresh cheeks were full of laughter
one had chestnut hair the other brown
their innocent faces were two delighted surprises a blossoming shrub which greene a reacted to the ladder why perfumes which seemed to emanate from them the child of eighteen months displayed her pretty little bare stomach with the chaste indecency of childhood
above and around these two delicate heads all made of happiness and steeped in light the gigantic fire carriage how do with rust almost terrible all entangled in curves and wild angles rose in a vault like the entrance of a cavern
a few paces a part crouching down upon the threshold of the hostelry then other not a very pre possessing woman by the way though touching at that moment was swinging the two children by means of a long cord watching them carefully for fear of accidents with that animal and celestial expression which is peculiar to maternity
at every backward and forward swing the hideous links emitted a strident sound which resembled a set of rage the little girls were in ecstasies the setting sun mingled in this joy and nothing could be more charming than this caprice of chance which had made of a chain of fit and the swing of cherubim
as she rocked her little knew the mother hummer in a discordant voices romance then celebrated it must be said a warrior
her song and the contemplation of her daughters prevented her hearing and seeing what was going on in the street
in the meantime someone had approached her as she was beginning the first couple for the romance and suddenly she heard a voice saying very best her ear you have two beautiful children there madame
to the fair and tender imogene replied the mother continuing her romance then she turned her head
a woman stood before her a few paces distant
this woman also had a child which she carried in her arms
she was carrying in addition a large carpet bag which seemed very heavy
this woman's child was one of the most divine creatures that it is possible to behold
it was a girl two or three years of age
she would have entered into competition with the two other little ones so far as the toque try other dress was concerned she wore a cap of fine linen ribbons on her bodice and valenciennes lace on her cap
the folds of her skirt were raised so as to permit a view other white firm and dimpled leg
she was admirably rosy and healthy
the little beauty inspired a desire to take a bite from the apples of her cheeks
of her eyes nothing could be known except that they must be very large and that they had magnificent lashes
she was asleep
she slept with that slumber of absolute confidence peculiar to her age
the arms of mothers are made of tenderness in them children sleep profoundly
as for the mother her appearance was sad and poverty stricken
she was dressed like a working woman who is inclined to turn into a peasant again
she was young
was she handsome
perhaps but in that attire it was not apparent
her hair a golden lock of which had escaped seemed very thick but was severely concealed beneath an ugly tight close n unlike cap toed under the chin
a smile displays beautiful teeth when one has them but she did not smile
her eyes did not seem to have been dry for a very long time
she was pale she had a very weary and rather sickly appearance
she gazed upon her daughter asleep in her arms with the air peculiar to a mother who has nursed her own child
a large blue handkerchief such as the invalides use was folded into a fishy and concealed her figure clumsily
her hands were sunburnt and all dotted with freckles her forefinger was hardened and lacerated with the needle she wore a cloak of coarse brown woollen stuff alone brown and coarse shoes
it was ranting
it was fan time but difficult to recognize
nevertheless on scrutinizing her attentively it was evident that she still retained her beauty
a melancholy fold which resembled the beginning of it out wrinkled her right cheek
as for her toilette that aerial toilette of muslin and ribbons which seemed made of mirth of folly and of music full of bells and perfumed with lilacs had vanished like that beautiful and dazzling up at frost which is mistaken for diamonds in the sunlight it melts and leaves the branch quite black
ten months had elapsed since the pretty farce
what has taken place during those ten months
it can be divined
after abandonment straightened circumstances
f anyone had immediately lost sight of favourites ephone and dahlia the bond once broken on the side of the men it was loosed between the women they would have been greatly astonished has anyone told them a fortnight later that they had been friends there no longer existed any reason for such a thing
f anyone had remained alone
the father of her child gone alas
such ruptures are irrevocable she found herself absolutely isolated minus the habit of work and plus the taste for pleasure
drawn away by her liaison with tho longest i disdain the pretty grace which she knew she had neglected to keep her market open it was now closed to get
she had no resource
fab time barely knew how to read and did not know how to write in her childhood she had only been taught to sign her name she had a public letter writer invite an epistle to tho i oh yes then a second them a third
thilo myra replied to none of them
f anyone heard the gossips say as they looked at her child who takes those children seriously
one only shrugs one's shoulders over such children
then she thought of full oh yes who had shrugged his shoulders over his child and who did not take that innocent being seriously and her heart grew gloomy toward by atman
but what was due to do
she no longer knew to whom to apply
she had committed a fault but the foundation of her nature as will be remembered was modesty and virtue
she was vaguely conscious that she was on the verge of falling into distress and of gliding into a words state
courage was necessary she possessed it and held herself firm
the idea of returning to her native town of m
shrm
occurred to her
there someone might possibly know her and give her work yes but it would be necessary to conceal her fault
i had one user says he perceived the necessity of a separation which would be more painful than the first one
her heart contracted but she took her resolution
fan time as we shall see had the fierce bravery of life
she had already valiantly renounced find run addressed herself in linen and had put all her silk sell her ornaments all her ribbons and all her laces on her daughter the only vanity which was left to her and a holy one it was
she sold all that she had which produced for her two hundred francs her little dental did she had only about eighty france left
at the age of twenty two on a beautiful spring morning she quitted paris bearing her child on her back
anyone who had seen these two pass would have had pity on them
this woman had in all the world nothing but her child and the child had in all the world no one but this woman
f anyone had nursed her child and this had to recherche stands he coughed a little
we shall have no further occasion to speak of m
felix thou oh yes
let us confine ourselves to saying that twenty years later under king louis philippe he was a great provincial lawyer wealthy and influent is lewis e. elector and a very severe jury man he was still a man of pleasure
towards the middle of the day after having from time to time for the sake of testing herself travelled for three or four sousa league in what was then known as the petites voitures de s environs de paris the little suburban coach service can find found herself at mint vermeil in the alley boulanger
as she passed the the barrier hostelry the two little girls blissful in the monsters wing had dazzled her in a manner and she had halted in front of that vision of joy
charms exist
these two little girls were a charm got his mother
she gazed at them in much emotion
the presence of angels is an announcement of paradise
she thought that above this int she beheld the mysterious hereof providence
these two little creatures were evidently happy
she gazed at them she admired them in such emotion that at the moment when their mother was recovering her breath between two couplets other songs he could not refrain from addressing to her the remark which we have just read you have two pretty children madame
the most ferocious creatures are disarmed by caresses bestowed on their young
the mother raised her head and thanked her and bade the wayfarer sit down on the bench at the door she herself being seated on the threshold
the two women began to chat
my name is madame the barrier said the mother of the two little girls
we keep this inn
then her mind still running on her romance she resumed humming between her teeth it must be so i am a knight and i am off to palestine
this madame the barrier was a sandy complexioned woman thin and angular the type of the soldier's wife in all its unpleasantness and what was odd with a languishing air which she owed to her perusal of romances
she was a simpering but masculine creature
old romances produce that effect when rubbed against the imagination of cookshop woman
she was still young she was barely thirty
if this crouching woman had stood upright her lofty stature and her frame of a per am by laying colossus suitable for fairs might have frightened the traveller at the outset troubled her confidence and disturbed what caused what we have to relate to vanish
a person who is seated instead of standing erect destinies hang upon such a thing as that
the traveller told her story with skin nt modifications
that she was a working woman that her husband was dead that her work in paris had failed her and that she was on her way to seek it elsewhere in her own native parts that she had left paris that morning on foot that as she was carrying her child and felt fatigued she had got into the ville kimble coach when she met it that from ville kimble she had come to mont vermeil on foot that the little one had walked a little but not much because she was so young and that she had been obliged to take her up and the jewel had fallen asleep
at this words he bestowed on her daughter a passionate kiss which woke her
the child opened her eyes great blue eyes like her mother's and looked at what
nothing with that serious and sometimes severe aug of little children which is a mystery of their luminous innocence in the presence of our twilight of virtue
one would say that they feel themselves to be angels and that they know us to be meb
then the child began to laugh and although the mother held fast to her she slipped to the ground with the unconquerable energy of a little being which wished to run
all at once she caught sight of the two others in the swing stopped short and put out her tongue in sign of admiration
mother then a drier released her daughters made them descend from the swing and sale now amuse yourselves all three of you
children become acquainted quickly at that age and at the expiration of a minute the little the marxists were playing with the newcomer at making holes in the ground which was an immense pleasure
the newcomer was very gay the goodness of the mother is written in the gayety of the child she had seized a scrap of wood which served her for a shovel and energetically dug a cavity big enough for a fly
the grave digger's business becomes a subject for laughter when performed by a child
the two women pursued their chat
what is your little one's name
cosette
for co setter save up tracie
the child's name was emp tracie
but put off up bras is the mother had made cosette by that sweet and graceful instinct of mothers and of the populace which changes joseph s. into pepita and francoise into willette
it is a sort of derivative which did arranges and did converts the whole science of ethno logisys
we have known a grandmother who succeeded in turning theodore into rnon
how old issue
she is going on three
that is the age of my eldest
in the meantime the three little girls were grouped in an attitude of profound anxiety and blissful need an event had happened a big worm had emerged from the ground and they were afraid and they were in ecstasies over it
their radiant brows touched each other one would have said that there were three years in one aureole
how easily children get acquainted at once
exclaimed mother the barrier one would swear that they were three sisters
this remark was probably the spark which the other mother had been waiting for
she seized the the barrier's hand looked at her fixedly and said will you keep my child for me
the the barrier made one of those movements of surprise which signify neither assent not refusal
cosette's mother continued you see i can not take my daughter to the country
my work will not permit it
with a child one can find no situation
people are ridiculous in the country
it was the good god who caused me to pass your inn
when i caught sight of your little ones so pretty so clean and so happy or overwhelmed me
i said' here is a good mother
that is just the thing that will make three sisters
' and then it will not be long before i return
will you keep my child for me
i must see about it replied the the barrier
i will give you six francs a month
here a man's voice called from the depths of the cookshop not for less than seven france
and six months paid in advance
six times seven makes forty two said the the barrier
i will give it said the mother
and fifteen france in addition for preliminary expenses added the man's voice
total dirty seven france said madame the barrier
and she hummer vaguely with these figures it must be said a warrior
i will pay it said the mother
i have eighty france
i shall have enough left to reach the country by travelling on file
i shall earn money there and as soon as i have a little i will return for my darling
the man's voice resumed the little one has an outfit
that is my husband said the the barrier
of course she has an outfit the poor treasure
i understood perfectly that it was your husband
and a beautiful outfit top
a senseless outfit everything by the dozen and silk gown's like a lady
it is here in my carpet bag
you must hand it over struck in the man's voice again
of course i shall give it to you said the mother
it would be very queer if i were to leave my daughter white naked
the master's face appeared
that's good said he
the bargain was concluded
the mother passed the night at the inn gave up her money and left her child fastened her carpet had once more now reduced in volume by the removal of the outfit and light henceforth and set out on the following morning intending to return soon
people arrange such departures tranquilly but they are despairs
a neighbor of the the barriers met this mother as she was setting out and came back with the remark i have just seen a woman crying in the street so that it was enough to rend your heart
when cosette's mother had taken her departure the man said to the woman that will serve to pay my note for one hundred and get francs which falls due tomorrow i lacked fifty france
do you know that i should have had a bailiff and a protest after me
you played the mousetrap nicely with your young ones
without suspecting it said the woman
chapter ii first sketch of two in pre possessing figures the house which had been caught was a pitiful specimen but the cat rejoice seven over a lean mouse
who were these the barriers
let us say a word or two of them now
we will complete the sketch later on
these beings be longed to that bastard class composed of coarse people who have been successful and of intelligent people who have descended in the scale which is between the class called middle and the class denominated as inferior and which combines some of the effects of the second with nearly all the vices of the first without possessing the generous impulse of the working man nor the honest order of the bourne pls
they were of those dwarfed natures which if a full five chances to warn them up easily become monstrous
there was in the woman a substratum of the brute and in the man the material for a blackguard
both were susceptible in the highest degree of the sort of hideous progress which is accomplished in the direction of evil
there exist crab like souls which are continually retreating towards the darkness retro trading in life rather than advancing employing experience to augment their deformity growing incessantly worse and becoming more and more impregnated with an ever augmenting blackness
this man and woman possessed such souls
the barrier in particular was troublesome for a physio gnomish
one can only look at some men to district them for one feels that they are dark in both directions
they are uneasy in the rear and threatening in front
there is some thing of the unknown about them
one can no more answer for what they have done than for what they will do
the shadow which they bear in their glance denounces the m
from merely hearing them utter a word or seeing them make a gesture one obtains a glimpse of sombre secrets in their past and of sombre mysteries in their future
this the barrier if he himself was to be believed has been a soldier a sergeant he said
he had probably been through the campaign of and had even conducted himself with tolerable valor it would seem
we shall see later on how much truth there was in this
the sign of his hostelry was in allusion to one of his fears of arms
he had painted it himself for he knew how to do a little of everything and badly
it was at the epoch when the ancient classical romance which after having been did lie was no longer anything but low pick a still noble but ever more and more vulgar having fallen from mademoiselle de scuderi to madame bourbon m alarms and from madame de la fayette to madame barthelemy had it was setting the loving hearts of the port resses of paris aflame and even ravaging the suburbs to some extent
madame the barrier was just intelligent enough to read this sort of books
she lived on them
it then she frowned what brains she possessed
this had given her when very young and even a little later a sort of pensive attitude towards her husband as camp of a certain depth a ruffian lettered to the extent of the grammar coarse and find a tone and the same time but so far as sentimentalism was concerned given to the perusal of pinault le brun and in what concerns the sea as he said in his jargon a downright unmitigated lout
his wife was twelve or fifteen years younger than he was
later on when her hair arranged in a romantically dropping fashion began to grow gray when the maya era began to be developed from the pamela the female the barrier was nothing but a coarse vicious woman who had dabbled in stupid romances
now one can not read nonsense with impunity
the result was that her eldest daughter was named epo nine as for the younger the poor little thing came near being called goin are i know not to what diversion effected by a romance of eu fraud u menil she owed the fact that she merely bore the name of a selma
however we will remark by the day everything was not ridiculous and superficial in that curious epoch to which we are alluring and which may be designated as the anarchy of baptismal games
by the side of this romantic element which we have just indicated there is the social symptom
it is not fare for the next here's boy nowadays to bear the name of arthur alfred or alphonse and for the vicomte if there are still any vicomte's to be called thomas pierre or jacques
this displacement which places the elegant name on the plebeian and the rustic name on the aristocratic nothing else than an eddy of equality
the irresistible penetration of the new inspiration is there as everywhere else
beneath this apparent discord there is a great and a profound thing the french revolution
chapter iii the park it is not all in all sufficient to be wicked in order to prosper
the cookshop was in a bad way
thanks to the traveller's fifty seven france then archer had been able to avoid a protest and to honor his signature
on the following month they were again in need of money
the woman took cosette's outfit to paris and pawned it at the pawnbroker's for sixty france
as soon as that sum was spent the the barriers grew accustomed to look on the little girl merely as a child whom they were caring for out of charity and they treated her accordingly
as she had no longer any clothes they dressed her in the cast off petticoats and chemises of the the barrier beats that is to say in rags
they fed her on what all the rest had left a little better than the dog a little worse than the cat
moreover the cat and the dog were her habitual table companions code create with them under the table from a wooden bowl similar to the irs
the mother who had established herself as we shall see later on atm
shrm
write or more correctly caused to be written a letter every month that she might have new signed child
the the barriers replied invariably cosette is doing wonderfully well
at the expiration of the first six months the mother sent seven francs for the seventh month and continued her remittances with tolerable regularity from month to month
the year was not completed when the harriers and a time favors he is doing is in sooth
what does she expect us to do with her seven france
and he wrote to demand twelve grants
the mother whom they had persuaded into the belief that her child was happy and was coming in well submitted and forwarded the twelve france
certain natures can not love on the one hand without hating on the other
mother then add usr loved her two daughters passionately which caused her to hate the stranger
it is sad to think that the love of a mother can possess villainous aspects
little ass as the space occupied by cosette it seemed to her as though it were taken from her own and that that little child diminished the air which her daughters breathed
this woman like many women other sort had a load of caresses and a burden of blows and injuries to dispense each day
if she had not had cosette it is certain that her daughters idolized as they were would have received the whole of it but the stranger did them the service to divert the blows to herself
her daughters received nothing but caresses
cosette could not make a motion which did not draw down upon her head a heavy shower of violent goods and unmerited chastisement
the sweet treble being who should not have understood anything of this world or of god incessantly punished scolded i'll used beaten and seeing beside her two little creatures like herself who lives in a day of dawn
madame the gardler was vicious with cosette
epo nine and a selma were vicious
children at that age are only copies of their mother
the size is smaller than us all
a year passed then another
people in the village said those the barriers are good people
they are not rich and yet they are bringing up a poor child who was abandoned on their hands
they thought that cosette's mother had forgotten her
in the meanwhile the hardier having learned it is impossible to say by what obscure means that the child was probably a bastard and that the mother could not acknowledge it exacted fifteen france a month saying that the creature was growing and eating and threatening to send her away
let her not bother me he exclaimed or i'll fire her bear right into the middle of her secrets
i must have an increase
the mother paid the fifteen france
from year to hear the child grew and so did her wretchedness
as long as cosette was little she was the scapegoat of the two other children as soon as she began to develop a little that is to say before she was even five years old she became the servant of the household
five years old
the reader will say that is not probable
alas
it is true
social suffering begins at all ages
have we got recently seen the trial of a man named du millard an orphan turned bandit who from the age office as the official documents state being alone in the world worked for his living and stole
cosette was made to run on errands to sweep the roots the courtyard the street to wash the wishes to even carry burdens
the the barriers considered themselves all the more authorized to behave in this manner since the mother who was still atm
shrm
had become irregular in her payments
some months she was in arrears
if this mother had returned to mint vermeil at the end of these three years she would not have recognized her child
cosette so pretty and rosy on her arrival in that house was now thin and pale
she had an indescribably uneasy look
the sky creature said that he had diets
injustice has made her peevish and misery had made her ugly
nothing remained to her except her beautiful eyes which inspired pain because large as they were it seemed as though one be held in the ma still larger amount of sadness
it was a heartbreaking thing to see this poor child not yet six years old shivering in the winter in her old days of linen full of holes sweeping the street before daylight with an enormous broom in her tiny red hands and a year in her great eyes
illustration cossette sweeping grosse the sweeping she was called the lark in the neighborhood
the populace who are fond of these figures of speech had taken a fancy to bestow this name on this trembling frightened and shivering little creature no bigger than a bird who was awake every morning before anyone else in the house of the village and was always in the street or the fields before daybreak
only the little park never sang
book fifth
the descent
chapter i. the history of a progress in black glass trinkets and in the meantime what had become of that mother who according to the people at mont vermeil seemed to have abandoned her child
where was she
what was she doing
after leaving her little cosette with the the barriers she had continued her journey and had reached m
sign
this it will be remembered was in
f anyone had quitted her province ten years before
m
shrm
had changed its aspect
whilst anyone had been slowly descending from wretchedness to wretchedness her native town has prospered
about two years previously one of those industrial facts which are the grand events of small districts had taken place
this detail is important and we regard it as useful to develop it at length we should almost say to underline it
from time immemorial m
shrm
had had for its special industry the imitation of english jet and the black glass trinkets of germany
this industry has always vegetated on account of the high price of the raw material which reached on the manufacture
at the moment when fan time returned to m
shrm
an unheard of transformation had taken place in the production of black goods
towards the close of a man a stranger had established himself in the town and had been inspired with the idea of substituting in this manufacturer impact of resin and for bracelets in particular slides of sheet iron simply paid together for slides of soldered sheet iron
this very small change had effected's revolution
this very small change had in fact prodigiously reduced the cost of the raw material which had rendered it possible in the first place to raise the price of manufacture a benefit to the country in the second place to improve the workmanship an advantage to the consumer in the third place to sell at a lower price while fee bling the profit which was a benefit to the manufactur wr
thus these results ensued from one idea
in less than three years the inventor of this process has become rich which is good and had made everyone about him rich which is better
he was a stranger in the department
of his origin nothing was known of the beginning of his career very little
it was rumored that he had come to town with very little money a few hundred francs at the most
it was from this slender capital enlisted in the service of an ingenious idea developed by method and thought that he had drawn his own for hume and the fortune of the whole countryside
on his arrival at m
eur j
he had only the garments the appearance and the language of a working man
it appears that on the very day when he made his obscure entry into the little town of m
shrm
just at nightfall on a december evening knapsack on back and thorn club in hand al ar before had broken out in the town hall
this man had rushed into the flames and saved at the risk of his own life two children who belonged to the captain of the gendarmerie this is why they had forgotten to ask him for his passport
afterwards they had learned his name
he was called father madeleine
chapter ii madeleine he was a man about fifty years of age who had a preoccupied air and who was good
that was all that could be said about him
thanks to the rapid progress of the industry which he had so admirably reconstructed m
shrm
had become a rather important centre of trade
spain which consumes a good deal of black yet made enormous purchase at here each year
m
shrm
almost rivalled london and heroin in this branch of commerce
father madeleine's profits were such that at the end of the second year he was able to erect a large factory in which there were two vast work rooms one for the men and the other for women
anyone who was hungry could present himself there and was sure of finding employment and bread
father madeleine required of the men goodwill of the women pure morals and of all probity
he had separated the work rooms in order to separate the sexes and so that the women and girls might remain discreet
on this point he was inflexible
it was the only thing in which he was in a manner intolerant
he was all the more firmly set on this severity since m
shrm
being a garrison town opportunities for corruption abounded
however his coming had been a boon and his presence was a godsend
before father madeleine's arrival everything has languished in the country now everything lived with a healthy life of toil
a strong circulation warmed everything and penetrated everywhere
slack seasons and wretchedness were unknown
there was no pocket so obscure that it had not a little money in it now selling solidly that there was not some little joy within it
father madeleine gave employment to everyone
he reacted but one thing be an honest man
be an honest woman
as we have said in the midst of this activity of which he was the cause and the pivot father madeleine made his fortune but a singular thing in a simple man of business it did not seem as though that were his chief care
he appeared to be thinking much of others and little of himself
in he was known to have a sum of six hundred and thirty thousand francs lodged in his name with laffitte but before he serving these six hundred and thirty thousand francs he had spent more than a million for the town and its poor
the hospital was badly endowed he founded six beds there
m
shrm
is divided into the upper and the lower town
the lower town in which he lived had but one schools miserable novel which was falling to ruin is constructed two one for girls the other for boys
he allotted a salary from his own funds to the two instructors a salary twice as large as their meagre official salary and one day he said to someone who expressed surprise the two prime functionaries of the seats are the nurse and the schoolmaster
he created at his own expense an infant school a thing then almost unknown in france and a fund for aiding old and infirm workmen
as his factory was a centre and a quarter in which there were a good many indigent families rose rapidly around him he established there a free dispensary
at first when they watched his beginnings the good souls said he's a jolly fellows home and to get rich
when they saw him enriching the country before he enriched himself the good souls said he is an ambitious man
this seemed all the more probable since the man was religious and even practiced his religion to a certain degree a thing which was very favor aclu viewed at that epoch
he went regularly to low mass every sunday
the local deputy who nosed out all rivalry everywhere soon began to grow uneasy over this religion
this deputy had been a member of the legislative body of the empire and shared the religious ideas of a father of the ira you're known under the name of touche ducd' or range whose creature and friend he had been
he indulged in gentle taille that god with closed doors
but when he beheld the wealthy manufacturer madeleine going to low mass at seveno'clock he perceived in him a possible candidate and resolved to kursk him he took a jesuit confessor and went to high mass and to vespers
ambition was at that time in the direct acceptation of the words race to the steeple
the poor profited by this terror as well as the good god for the honorable deputy also founded two beds in the hospital which made twelve
nevertheless in a rumor one morning circulated through the town to the effect that on the representations of the prefect and in consideration of the services rendered by him to the country father madeleine was to be appointed by the king mayor of j
shrm
those who had pronounced this newcomer to be an ambitious fellow seized with delight in this opportunity which all men desire to exclaim there
what did we say
all m
shrm
was in an uproar
the rumor was well founded
several days later the appointment appeared in the moniteur
on the following day father madeleine refused
on this same year of the products of the new price as invented by madeleine figured in the industrial exhibition when the jury made their report the king appointed the inventors chevalier of the legion of honor
a great excitement in the little town
well so it was the cross that he wanted
father madeleine refused the cross
decidedly this man was an enigma
the good soul's got out of their predicament by saying after all he is some sort of an adventurer
we have seen that the country owed much to him the poor owed him everything he was so useful and he was so gentle that people had been obliged to honor and respect him
his work men in particular adored him and he endured this adoration with a sort of melancholy gravity
when he was known to be rich people in society bowed to him and he received invitations in the town he was called into en monsieur madeleine his work men and the children continued to call him father madeleine and that was what was most adapted to make him smile
in proportion as he mounted thrive invitations rained down upon him
society claimed him for its own
the prim little drawing room son m
shrm
which of course had at first been closed to the artisan opened both leaves of their folding doors to the million naire
they made a thousand advance who him
he refused
this time the good gossips had no trouble
he is an ignorant man of no education
no one knows where he came from
he would not know how to behave in society
it has not been absolutely proved that he knows how to read
when they saw him making money they said he is a man of business
when they saw him scattering his money about they said he is an ambitious man
when he was seen to decline honors they said he is an adventurer
when they saw him repulse society they said he is a brute
in five years after his arrival in m
shrm
the services which he had rendered to the district were so dazzling the opinion of the whole country roundabout was so unanimous that the king again appointed him mayor of the town
he again declined but the prefect resisted his refusal all the not abilities of the place came to implore him the people in the street besought him the urging was so vigorous that he ended by accepting
it was noticed that the thing which seemed chiefly to bring him to a decision was the almost irritated apostrophe addressed to him by an old woman of the people who called to him from her threshold in an angry way a good mayor is a useful thing
is he drawing back before the good which he can do
this was the third phase of his ascent
father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine
monsieur madeleine became monsieur lemaire
chapter iii sums deposited with laffitte on the other hand he remained as simple as on the first day
he had gray hair a serious eye the sunburned complexion of a laborer the thoughtful visage of a philosopher
he habitually wire what with a wide brim and a long coat of coarse cloth buttoned to the chin
he fulfilled his duties as mayor but with that exception he lived in solitude
he spoke to but few people
he avoided polite attention she escaped quickly he smiled to relieve himself of the necessity of talking he gave in order to get rid of the necessity for smiling the women's aid of him what a good natured bear
his pleasure consisted in strolling in the fields
he always took his meals alone with an open book've for whom which he dead
he had a well selected little library
he loved books books are cold but safe friends
in proportion as leisure came to him with fortune he seemed to take advantage of it to cultivate his mind
it had been observed that ever since his arrival at m
shrm
how language had grown more polished more choice and more gentle with every passing year
he liked to carry a gun with him on his strolls but he rarely made use of it
when he did happen to do so his shop tube was something so infallible as to inspire terror
he never killed an inoffensive animal
he never shot at a little bird
although he was no longer young it was thought that he was still prodigiously strong
he offered his assistance to anyone who was in need of it lifted a horse released a wheels logged in the mud or stopped a runaway bull by the horns
he always had his pockets full of money when he went out but they were empty on his return
when he passed through a village the tagged brats ran joyously after him and surrounded him like a swarm of gnats
it was thought that he must in the past have lived a country life since he knew all sorts of useful secrets which he taught to the peasants
he taught them how to destroy scuff on wheat by sprinkling it and the granary and inundating the cracks in the floor with a solution of common salt and how to chase away weevils by hanging up or foot in bloom everywhere on the walls and the ceilings among the grass and in the houses
he had recipes for exterminating from a field flight rates foxtail and all parasitic growths which destroy the wheat
he defended a rabbit warren against rate simply by the odor of a guinea pig which he placed in it
one day he saw some country people busily engaged in pulling up nettles be examined the plants which were uprooted and already dried and said they are dead
nevertheless it would be a good thing to know how to make use of them
when the nettle is going the leaf makes an excellent vegetable when it is older it has filaments and fibres like hemp and flax
bettie cloth is as good as linen cloth
chopped up nettles are good for poultry pounded they are good for horned cattle
the seed of the nettle mixed with fodder gives gloss to the hair of animals the root mixed with salt produces a beautiful yellow coloring matter
moreover it is an excellent may which can be cut twice
and what is required for the nettle
a little soil nov are no culture
only the seed falls as it is ripe and it is difficult to collect it
that is all
with the exercise of a little case the nettle could be made useful it is neglected and it becomes hurtful
it is exterminated
how many men resemble the nettle
he added after a pause remember this my friends there are no such things as bad plants or bad men
there are only bad cultivators
the children loved him because he knew how to make charming little trifles of straw and cocoa nuts
when he saw the door of a church hung in black he entered he sought out funerals as other men seek christenings
widowhood and the grief of others attracted him because of his great gentleness he mingled with the friends clad in mourning with families dressed in black with the priests groaning around a coffin
he seemed to like to give to his thoughts for text these funereal psal movies filled with the vision of the other world
with his eyes fixed in heaven he listened with a sort of aspiration towards all the mysteries of the infinite those sad voices which sing on the verge of the obscure abyss of death
he performed a multitude of good actions concealing his agency in them as a man conceals himself because of evil actions
he penetrated houses privately at night he ascended staircases furtively
a poor wretch on returning to his attic would find that his door had been opened sometimes even forced during his absence
the poor man made a clamor i've got some malefactor had been there
he entered and the first thing he beheld was a piece of gold lying forgo the non some piece of furniture
the male factor who had been there was rather madeleine
he was affable and sad
the people said there is a rich man who has not a haughty air
there is a happy man who has not a contented air
some people maintained that he was a mysterious person and that no one ever entered his chamber which was a regular and for its's cell furnished with winged your glasses and enlivened by cross bones and skulls of dead men
this was much talked of so that one of the elegant and malicious young women of m
shrm
came to him one day and asked monsieur le hairspray show us your chamber
it is said to be a grotto
he smiled and introduced them instantly into this grotto
they were well punished for their curiosity
the room was very simply furnished in mahogany which was rather ugly like all furniture of that sort and hung with paper worth twelve sous
they could see nothing remarkable about it except two candlesticks of antique pattern which stood on the chimney piece and appeared to be silverton they were hallmarked an observation full of the type of wit of petty towns
nevertheless people continued to say that no one ever got into the room and that it was a hermit's face a mysterious retreat whole atom b
it was also whispered about that he had immense sums deposited with laffitte with this peculiar feature that they were always at his immediate disposal so that it was added m
madeleine could make his appearance at laffitte's any morning sign a receipt and carry off his two or three millions in ten minutes
in reality these two or three millions were reducible as we have said to six hundred and thirty or forty thousand francs
chapter iv m
madeleine in mourning at the beginning of the newspapers announced the death of m
muriel bishop of d surnames monseigneur bienvenu who had died in the odor of sanctity at the age of eighty two
the bishop off to supply here a detail which the papers omitted had been blind for many years before his death and content to be blind as his sister was beside him
let us remark by the way that to be blind and to beloved is in fact one of the most strangely exquisite forms of happiness upon this earth where nothing is complete
to have continually at one's side a woman a daughter a sister a charming being who is there because you need her and because she can not do without you to know that we are indispensable to a person who is necessary to us to be able to incessantly measure one's affection by the amount of her presence which she bestows on us and to say to ourselves since she consecrated the whole of her time to me it is because i possess the whole of her heart to be told her thought in lieu of her face to be able to verify the fidelity of one being amid the eclipse of the world to regard the rustle of shown as the sound of wings to hear her come and to retire speak return sing and to think that one is the centre of these steps of this speech to manifest at each instant one's personal attraction to feel one's self all the more powerful because of one's infirmity to become in one's obscurity and through one's obscurity the star around which this angel gravitates few velocities equal this
the supreme happiness of life consists in the conviction that one is loved loved for one's own sake let us say rather lived in spite of one's self this conviction the blind man possessed
to be served in distress is to be caressed
does he lack anything
no
one does not lose the sight when one has love
and what love
w love wholly constituted of virtue
there is no blindness where there is certainty
soulseek's soul groping it and finds it
and this soul found and tested is a woman
ah and sustains you it is here a mouth lightly touched your brow it is her mouth you hear a breath very near you it is here
to have everything of her from her worship to her pity never to be left to have that sweet weakness aiding you to lean upon that immovable feed to touch providence with one's hands and to be able to take it in one's arms god made tangible what bliss
the heart that obscure celestial flower undergoes a mysterious blossoming
one would not exchange that shadow for all brightness
the angel soul is there uninterruptedly there if she departs it is but to return again she vanished like a dream and reappears like reality
one feels warmth approaching and behold
she is there
one overflows with serenity with gareth with ecstasy one is a radiance amid the night
and there are a thousand little cases
no things which are enormously that void
the most ineffable accents of the feminine voice employed to lull you and supplying the vanished universe to you
one is caressed with the soul
one sees nothing but one feels that one is adored
it is a paradise of shadows
it was from this paradise that monseigneur welcome had passed to the other
the announcement of his death was reprinted by the local journal of m
shrm
in the following day m
madeleine appeared clad wholly in black and with craps on his hat
this mourning was noticed in the town and commented on
it seemed to throw a light of m
madeleine's origin
it was concluded that some relationship existed between him and the venerable bishop
he has gone into mourning for the bishop of'd said the drawing rooms this raised m
madeleine's credit greatly and procured for him instantly and stone blow a certain consideration in the noble world of m
shrm
the microscopic faubourg saint germain of the place meditated raising the quarantine against m
madeleine the probable relative of a bishop
m
madeleine perceived the advancement which he had obtained by the more numerous courtesies of the old woman and the more plentiful smiles of the young ones
one evening a ruler in that petty great world who was curious by right of seniority ventured to ask him m
lemaire is doubtless a cousin of the late bishop of d
he said no madame
but resumed the dowager you are wearing mourning for him
he replied it is because i was a servant in his family in my youth
another thing which was remarked was that every time that he encountered in the town a young savoyard who was roaming about the country and seeking chimneys to sweep the mayor had him summoned inquired his name and gave him money
the little savoyard stood each other about it a great many of them passed that way
chapter v vague flashes on the horizon little by little and in the course of time all this opposition subsided
there had at first been exercised against m
madeleine in virtue of a sort of law which all those who rise must submit to blackening and calumnies then they grew to be nothing more than ill nature then merely malicious remarks then even this entirely disappeared respect became complete unanimous cordial and towards the moment arrived when the word monsieur lemaire was pronounced atm
shrm
with almost the same as sent as monseigneur the bishop had been pronounced und in
people came from a distance often leagues around to consult m
madeleine
he put an end to differences be prevented lawsuits be reconciled enemies
everyone took him for the judge and with good reason
it seemed as though he had for a soul the book of the natural law
it was like an epidemic of vegetation which in the course of six or seven years gradually took possession of the whole district
one single man in the town in the arrondissement absolutely escaped this contagion and whatever father madeleine did remained his opponent as though a sort of incorruptible and imperturbable instinct kept him on the alert and uneasy
it seems in fact as though there existed in certain men a veritable bestial instinct though pure and upright like all instincts which creates anti parties and sympathies which fatally separates one nature from another nature which does not hesitate which feels to disquiet which does not hold its peace and which never be lies itself clear in its obscurity infallible imperious intractable stubborn to all counsels of the intelligence and to all the dis solvents of reason and which in whatever manner destinies are arranged secretly warns the man dog of the presence of the man cat and the man box of the presence of the man lion
it frequently happened that when m
madeleine was passing along a street calm affectionate surrounded by the blessings of all a man of lofty stature clad in an iron gray frock coat armed with a heavy cane and wearing a battered hat turned found abruptly behind him and followed him with his eyes until he disappeared with folded arms and as low shake of the head and his upper lip raised in company with his power to his nose a sort of significant grimace which might be translated by what is that man after all
i certainly have seen him somewhere
in any case i am not his dupe
this person grave with a gravity which was almost menacing was one of those men who even when only seen by a rapid glimpse arrest the spectator's attention
his name was javert and he belonged to the police
atm
shrm
he exercised the unpleasant but useful functions of an inspector
he had not seen madeleine's beginnings
javert owed the lost which he occupied to the pro tection of m
chan phil let the secretary of the minister of state comte angeles then prefect of police at paris
when javert arrived at m
eur j
the fortune of the great many facturer was already made and father madeleine had become monsieur madeleine
certain police officers have a peculiar physiognomy which is complicated with an air of baseness mingled with an air of authority
javert possessed this physiognomy minus the baseness
it is our conviction that if souls were visible to the eyes we should be able to see distinctly that strange thing that each one individual of the human race corresponds to someone of the species of the animal creation and we could easily recognize this truth hardly perceived by the thinker that from the oyster to the eagle from the pig to the tiger all animals exist in man and that each one of them is in a man
sometimes even several of them at a time
animals are nothing else than the figures of our virtues and our gives straying before our eyes the visible phantoms of our souls
god shows them to us in order to induce is to reflect
only since animals are mere shadow's god has not made them capable of education in the full sense of the word what is the use
on the contrary our souls being realities and having a goal which is appropriate to them god has bestowed on them intelligence that is to say the possibility of education
social education when we'll find can always draw from a soil or whatever sort it may be the utility which it contains
this be it said is of course from the restricted point of view of the terrestrial life which is apparent and without prejudging the profound question of the anterior or ulterior personality of the beings which are not man
the visible i in nowise authorizes the thinker to deny the la tengo
having made this reservation let us pass on
now if the reader will admit for a moment with us that in every man there is one of the animal species of creation it will be easy for us to say what there was in police officer javert
the peasants of asturias are convinced that in every litter of wolves there is one dog which is killed by the mother because otherwise as he grew up he would devour the other little ones
give to this dog son of a wolf a human face and the result will be javert
javert has been born in prison of a fortune teller whose husband was in the galleys
as he grew up he thought that he was outside the pale of society and he despaired of ever're entering it
he observed that society in pardoning it excludes two classes of men those who attack it and those who guard if he had no choice except between these two classes at the same time he was conscious of an indescribable foundation of rigidity regularity and probity complicated with an inexpressible hatred for the race of bohemians whence he was sprung
he entered the police he succeeded there
at forty years of age he was an inspector
during his youth he had been employed in the convict establishments of the south
before proceeding further let us come to an understanding as to the words human face which we have just applied to javert
the human face of javert consisted of a flat nose with two deep nostrils towards which enormous whiskers ascended on his cheeks
one felt ill at ease when he saw these two forests and these two caverns for the first time
when javert laughed and his laugh was rare and terrible his thin lips parted and revealed to view not only his teeth but his gums and around his nose there formed a flattened and savage food as on the muzzle of a wild beast
is very serious was a watchdog when he laughed he was a tiger
as for the rest he had very little skull and a great deal of jaw his hair concealed his forehead and fell over his eyebrows between his eyes there was a permanent central brown like an imprint of wrath his gaze was obscure his mouth purses up and terrible h i said that of ferocious command
this man was composed of two very simple and two very good sentiments comparatively but he rendered them almost had by dint of exaggerating them respect for authority hatred of rebellion and in his eyes murder robbery all crimes are only forms of rebellion
he enveloped in a blind and profound faith everyone who had a function in the state from the prime minister to the rural policeman
he covered with scorn aversion and disgust everyone who had once crossed the legal threshold of evil
he was absolute and admitted no exceptions
on the one hand he said the functionary can make no mistake the magistrate is never the wrong
on the other hand he said these men are ieee media boy lost
nothing good can come from them
he fully shared the opinion of those extreme minds which attribute to human law i know got what power of making or if the reader will have it sk of authenticating demons and who places styx at the base of society
he was stoical serious austere a melancholy dreamer humble and haughty like fanatics
his glance was like a gimlet cold and piercing
his whole life hung on these two words watchfulness and supervision
he had introduced a straight line into what is the most crooked thing in the world he possessed the conscience of his usefulness the religion of his functions and he was a spy as other men are priests
woe to the man who fell into his hands
he would have arrested his own father of the latter had escaped from the valleys and would have renounced his mother if she had broken her bag
and he would have done it with that sort of inward satisfaction which is conferred by virtue
and withal a life of privation isolation abnegation chastity with never a diversion
it was implacable duty the police understood as the spartans understood sparta a pitiless lying in wait a ferocious honesty a marble informe they t using kdoc q
javert's whole par son was expressive of the man who skies and who withdraws himself from observation
the mystical school of joseph de maistre which at that epoch seasoned with lofty cosmogony those things which were called the ultra newspapers would not have failed to declare that have rt was a symbol
his brow was not visible it disappeared beneath his hat his eyes were not visible since they were lost under his eyebrows his chin was not visible for it was plunged in his cravat his hands were not visible they were drawn up in his sleeves and his cane was not visible he carried it undergoes oag
but when the occasion presented itself there was suddenly seem to emerge from all this shadow as from a nambucca dean arrow and angular forehead a baleful glance a threatening chin enormous hands and a monstrous cudgel
in his leisure moments which were far from frequent he read although he hated books this raised him to be not wholly illiterate
this could be recognized by some emphasis in his speech
as we have said he had no vices
when he was pleased with himself be permitted himself a pinch of snuff
there inlay his connection with humanity
the reader will have no difficulty in understanding that is very was the terror of that whole class which the annual statistics of the ministry of justice designated under the rubric vagrants
the name of javert routes them by its here utterance the face of javert petrified them at sight
such was this form of acidman
javert was like an eye constantly fixed on m
madeleine
an eye full of suspicion and conjecture
m
madeleine had finally perceived the fact but it seemed to be of no importance to him
he did not even put a question to have r. then with an sought not avoided him before that embarrassing and almost oppressive gaze without appearing to notice it
he treated javert with ease and courtesy as he did all the rest of the world
it was divined from some words which escaped javert that he has secretly investigated with that curiosity which belongs to the race and into which there enters as much instinct as will all the anterior traces which father madeleine might have left elsewhere
he seemed to know and he sometimes said in covert words that someone had gleaned certain information in a certain district about a family which had disappeared
once he chanced to say as he was talking to himself i think i have him
then he remained pensive for three days and uttered not a word
it seemed that the thread which he thought he held had broken
moreover and this furnishes the necessary corrective for the top absolute sense which certain words might present there can be nothing really infallible in a human creature and the peculiarity of instinct is that it can become confused thrown off the track and defeated
otherwise it would be superior to intelligence and the beast would be found to be provided with a better light than man
javert was evidently somewhat disconcerted by the perfect naturalness and tranquillity of m
madeleine
one day nevertheless his strange manner appeared to produce an impression on m
madeleine
it was on the following occasion
chapter vi father gauche le vent one morning m
madeleine was passing through an unpaved alley of m
she m
he heard a noise and saw a group some distance away
he approached
an old man named father rauch eleventh adjust fallen beneath his cart his horse having tumbled down
this gauche l event was one of the few enemies who mm
madeleine had at that time
when madeleine arrived in the neighborhood gauche le vent and a notary and a peasant who was almost educated had a business which was beginning to be in a bad way
fancy eleventh as seen this simple workman grow rich while he a lawyer was being ruined
this has filled him with jealousy and he had done all he could on every occasion to injure madeleine
then bankruptcy had come and as the old man had nothing left but as art and a horse and neither family nor children he had turned carter
the horse had two broken legs and could not rise
the old man was caught in the wheels
the fall had been so unlucky that the whole weight of the vehicle rested on his breast
the cart was quite heavily laden
father gauche l event was rattling in the throat in the most lamentable manner
they had tried but in vain to drag him out
an un methodical effort aid awkwardly given a wrong shake might kill him
it was impossible to disengage him otherwise than by lifting the vehicle off of him
javert who had come up at the moment of the accident had sent for snacks crew
m
madeleine arrived
people stood aside respectfully
help
cried old gauche le vent
who will be good and save the old man
m
madeleine turned towards those present is there a jack screw to be had
one has been sent for answered the peasant
how long will it take to get it
they have gone for the nearest to black it's place where there is a carrier but it makes no difference it will take a good quarter of an hour
a quarter of an hour
exclaimed madeleine
it had rained on the preceding night the soil was soaked
the cart wasson king deeper into the earth every moment and crushing the old carter's breast more and more
it was evident that his ribs would be broken in five minutes more
it is impossible to wait another quarter of an hour said madeleine to the peasants who were staring at him
we must
but it will be too late then
don't you see that the cart is sinking
well
listen resumed madeleine there is still room enough under the cart to allow a man to crawl beneath it and raise it with his back
only half a minute and the poor man can be taken out
is there anyone here who has stout loins and heart
there are five louisd' or to be earned
not a man in the group stirred
ten louis said madeleine
the persons present dropped their eyes
one of them muttered a man would need to be devilish strong
and then he runs the risk of getting crushed
come began madeleine again twenty louis
the same silence
it is not the wiki which is lacking said a voice
m
madeleine turned round and recognized javert
he had not noticed him on his arrival
javert went on it is strength
one would have to be a terrible man to do such a thing as lifts cart like that on his back
then gazing fixedly at m
madeleine he went on emphasizing every word that he uttered monsieur madeleine i have never known but one man capable of doing what you ask
madeleine shuddered
javert added with an air of indifference but without removing his eyes from madeleine he was a convict
ah
said madeleine
in the galleys at toulon
madeleine turned pale
meanwhile the cart continued to sink slowly
father gauche le vent rattled in the throat and shrieked i am strangling
my ribs are breaking
a screw
something
ah
madeleine glanced about him
is there then no one who wishes to earn twenty louis and save the life of this poor old man
no one stirred
javert resumed i have never known but one man who could take the place of a screw and he was that convict
ag
it is crushing me
cried the old man
madeleine raised his head met javert's falcon eye still fixed upon him looked at the motionless peasants and smiled sadly
then without saying a word he fell on his knees and before the crowd had even had time to utter a cry he was underneath the vehicle
a terrible moment of expectation and silence ensued
they beheld madeleine almost flat on his stomach beneath that terrible weight make two vain efforts to bring his knees and his elbows together
they shouted to him father madeleine come out
old gauche le vent himself said to him monsieur madeleine go away
you see that i am fated to die
leave me
you will get yourself crushed also
madeleine made no reply
all the spectators were panting
the wheels has continued to sink and it had become almost impossible for madeleine to make his way from under the vehicle
suddenly the enormous mass was seen to quiver the cart rose slowly the wheels half emerged from the ruts
they heard a stifled voice crying make haste
help
it was madeleine who had just made a final effort
they rushed forward s
the devotion of a single man had given force and courage to all
the carr was raised by twenty arms
old gauche l event was saved
madeleine rose
he was pale though dripping with perspiration
his clothes were torn and covered with mud
all wept
the old man kissed his knees and called him the good now
as for him before upon his countenance an indescribable expression of happy and celestial suffering and he fixed his tranquil eye on javert who was still staring at him
chapter vii gauche le vent becomes a gardener in paris rauch eleventh as dislocated his knee pan in his fall
father madeleine had him conveyed to an infirmary which he had established for his work men in the factory building itself and which was served by two sisters of charity
in the following morning the old man found a thousand franc bank note on his night stand with these words in gather madeleine's writing i purchase your horse and cart
the cart was broken and the horse was dead
faux telecentre covered by this knee remained stuff
m
madeleine on the recommendation of the sisters of charity and of his priest got the goodman a place as gardener in a female convent in the rue saint antoine in paris
some time afterwards m
madeleine was appointed mayor
the first time that is very be held m
madeleine clothed in the scarf which gave him authority over the town he felt the sort of shudder which award belt might experience on smelling a wolf in his master's clothes
from that time forth be avoided him as much as he possibly could
when the requirements of the service imperatively demanded it and he could not do otherwise than meet the mayor be addressed him with profound respect
this prosperity created atm
shrm
by father madeleine had besides the visible signs which we have mentioned another symptom which was nonetheless significant for not being visible
this never deceived
when the population suffers when work is lacking when there is no commerce the taxpayer resists imposts through penury he exhausts and over steps his respite and the states spends a great deal of money in the charges for compelling and collection
when work is abundant when the country is rich and happy the taxes are paid easily and cost the state nothing
it may be said that there is one infallible thermometer of the public misery and riches the cost of collecting the taxes
in the course of seven years the expense of collecting the taxes had diminished three fourths in the arrondissement of m
shrm
and this led to this arrondissement being frequently cited from all the rest by m
deville le then minister of finance
such was the condition of the country when fan time returned thither
no one remembered her
fortunately the door of m
madeleine's factory was like the face of a friend
she presented herself there and was admitted to the women's workroom
the trade was entirely new tocantins she could not be very skilful at it and she therefore earned but little by her cat's work but it was sufficient the problem was solved she was earning her living
chapter viii madame vic turn own expense thirty france on morality when bantine saw that she was making her living she felt joyful for a moment
to live honestly by her own labor what mercy from heaven
the taste for work had really returned to her
she fought a looking glass took pleasure in surveying in it usr youth her beautiful hair her fine teeth she forgot many things she thought only of cosette and of the possible future and was almost happy
she hired a little room and furnished on credit on the strength of her future work a lingering trace of her improvident days
as she was not able to say that she was married she took good care as we have seen not to mention her little girl
at first as the reader has seen she paid the the barriers promptly
as she only knew how to sign her name she was obliged to write through a public letter writer
she wrote often and this was notices
it began to be said in an undertone in the women's dorm room that can find wrote letters and that she had ways about her
there is no one for spying on people's actions like those who are not concerned in them
why does that gentleman never come except at nightfall
why does mr.
sp and so never hang his key on its nail on tuesday
why does he always take the narrow streets
why does madame always descend from her hackney coach before reaching her house
why does she send out to purchase six sheets of notepaper when she has a while stationed's shop full of it
etc.
there exist beings who for the sake of obtaining the key to these enigmas which are moreover of no consequence whatever to them spend more money waste more time take more trouble than would be required for ten good actions and that gratuitously for their own pleasure without receiving any other payment for their curiosity than curiosity
they will follow up such and such a major women for whole days they will do sentry duty for hours at a time in the corners of the streets under alleyway doors at night in cold and rain they will bribes transporters they will make the drivers of hackney coaches and lackeys tipsy buy awaiting maids u born a porter
why
for no reason
a pure passion for seeing knowing and penetrating into things
a pure inch for talking
and often these secret since known these mysteries made public these enigmas illuminated by the light of day bring in far as trophies fuels failures the ruin of families and broken lives to the great joy of those who have found out everything without any interest in the matter and by pure instinct
a sad thing
certain persons are malicious solely through a necessity for talking
their conversation the chat of the drawing room gossip of the anteroom is like those chimneys which consume wood rapidly they need a great amount of combustibles and their combustibles are furnished by their neighbors
's of any one was watches
in addition many a one was jealous of her golden hair and other white teeth
it was remarked that in the workroom she often turned aside in the midst of the rest to wipe away a text
these were the moments when she was thinking of her child perhaps also of the man whom she had loved
breaking the gloomy bonds of the past is a mournful task
it was observed that she wrote twice a month at least and that she paid the carriage on the letter
they managed to obtain the address monsieur monsieur the nerdier innkeeper at mont vermeil
the public writers good old man who could not fill his stomach with red wine without emptying his pocket of secrets was made to talk in the wine shop
in short it was discovered that can give had a child
she must be a pretty sort of a woman
an old gossip was found who made the trip to montrer neil talked to the then we do ers and said in her return for my five and thirty francs i have freed my mind
i have seen the child
the gossip who did this thing was a gorgon named madame vic turn key the guardian and doorkeeper of everyone's virtue
madame vic turn ken was fifty six and teen forced the mask of ugliness with the mask of age
a quavering voice a whimsical mind
this old dame had once been young astonishing fact
in her mouth in' she had married a monk who had fled from his cloister in a red cap and passed from the bernardi new to the jacobins
she was dry rough peevish sharp caprio is almost venomous all this in memory of her monk whose widow she was and who had ruled over her masterfully and bent her to his will
she was a mettle in which the rustle of the caddick was visible
at the restoration she had turned boron and that with so much energy that the priests had forgiven her her monk
she has a small property which she bequeathed with much ostentation to a religious community
she was in high favor at the episcopal palace of areas
so this madame vic turn ken went to mont vermeil and returned with the remark i have seen the child
all this took time
f anyone had been at the factory for more than a year when one morning the superintendent of the workroom handed her fifth france from the mayor told her that she was no longer employed in the shop and requested her in the mayor's name to leave the neighborhood
this was the very month when the then add legs after having we handed twelve france instead of such adjusted after fifteen france instead of twelve
fan time was overwhelmed
she could not leave the neighborhood she was in debt for her rent and furniture
fifty france was not sufficient to cancel this debt
she stammered a few supp locating words
the superintendent ordered her to leave the shop on the instant
besides fan time was only a moderately good work woman
overcome with shame even more than with despair she quitted the shop and returned to her room
so her fault was now known to everyone
she no longer felt strong enough to say sword
she was advised to see the mayor she did not care
the mayor had given her fifth france because he was good and had dismissed her because he was just
she bowed before the decision
chapter ix madame vic turn ken's success so the monk's widow was good for something
but m
madeleine had heard nothing of all this
life is full of just such combinations of events
m
madeleine was in the habit of almost never entering the women's workroom
at the head of this room he had placed an elderly spinster whom the priest had provided for him and he had full confidence in this super intend ent a truly respectable person firm equitable uptight full of the charity which consists in giving but not having in the same degree that charity which consists in understanding and unforgiving
m
madeleine relied wholly on her
the best men are often obliged to delegate their authority
it was with this full power and the conviction that she was doing right that the superintendent has instituted the suit judged condemned and executed fan time
as regards the fifty france she had given them from a fund which m
madeleine had intrusted to her for charitable purposes and for giving assistance to the work women and of which she rendered no account
fan time tried to obtain a situation as a servant in the neighborhood she went from house to house
no one would have her
she could not leave town
the second hand dealer to whom she was in webct other furniture and what furniture
said to her if you leave i will have you arrested as a thief
the householder whom she owed for her rent said to her you are young and pretty you can pay
she divided the fifty france between the landlord and the furniture dealer returned to the latter three quarters of his goods kept only necessaries and found herself without work without a trade with nothing but her bed and still about fifty francs in debt
she began to make coarse shirts for soldiers of the garrison and earned twelve sousa day
her daughter cost herren
it was at this point that she began to pay the the barriers irregularly
however the old woman who lighted her candle for her when she returned at night taught her the art of living in misery
back of living on little there is the living on nothing
these are the two chambers the first is seek the second is black
fan time learned how to live without fire entirely in the winter how to give up a bird which eats a half a farthing's worth of millet every two days how to make a coverlet of one's petticoat and a petticoat of one's coverlet how to save one's candle by taking one's meals by the light of the opposite window
no one knows all that certain feeble creatures who have grown old i motivation and honesty can get out of a sou
it ends by being a talent
fan time acquired this sublime talent and regained a little courage
at this epoch she said to a neighbor bag
i say to myself by only sleeping five hours and working all the rest of the time at my sewing i shall always manage to nearly each my bread
and then when one is sad one eats less
well sufferings uneasiness a little bread on one hand trouble on the other all this will support me
it would have been a great happiness to have her little girl with her in this distress
she thought of having her come
but what then
make her share her own destitution
and then she was in debt to the then are less
how could she pay them
and the journey
how pay for that
the old woman who had given her lessons in what may be called the life of indigence was a saint e f spinster named marguerite who was poons with a true piety poor and charitable towards the poor and even towards the rich knowing how to write just sufficiently to sign herself marguerite and believing in god which is science
there are many such virtuous people in this lower world someday they will be in the world above
this life has a morrow
at first day time had been so ashamed that she had not dared to go out
when she was in the streets he divined that people turned round behind her and pointed at her everyone stared at her and no one greeted her the cold and bitter scorn of the passers by penetrated her very flesh and soul like a northwind
it seems as though an unfortunate woman were utterly bare beneath the sarcasm and the curiosity of all in small towns
in paris at least no one knows you and this obscurity is a garment
oh
how she would have liked to be take herself to paris
impossible
she was obliged to accustom herself to disrepute as she had accustomed herself to indigence
gradually she decided on her course
at the expiration of two or three months she shook off her shame and began to go about as though there were nothing the matter
it is all the same time she said
she went and came bearing her head well up with a bitter smile and was conscious that she was becoming brazen faced
madame vic turn ken sometimes saw her passing from her window noticed the distress of that creature who thanks to her had been put back in her proper place and congratulated herself
the happiness of the evil minded is black
excess of toil word out fan time and the little dry cough which troubled her increased
she sometimes said to her neighbor marguerite just feel how got my hands are
nevertheless when she combed her beautiful hair in the morning with an old broken comb and it flowed about her like flows will she experienced a moment of happy coquet ry
chapters result of the success she had been dismissed towards the end of the winter the summer passed but winter came again
short days less work
winter no warmth no light no noonday the evening joining onto the morning fog's twilight the window is gray it is impossible to see clearly at it
the sky is but a vent hole
the whole day is a cavern
the sun has the air of a beggar
a frightful season
winter changes the water of heaven and the heart of man into a stone
her creditors harrassed ber
can find earned too little
her debts had increased
the the barriers who were not promptly paid wrote to her constantly letters whose contents drove her to despair and whose carriage ruined her
one day they wrote to her that her little cosette was entirely naked on that cold weather that she needed a woollen skirt and that her mother must send at least ten francs for this
she received the letter and crushed it in her hands all day long
that evening she went into a barber's shop at the corner of the street and pulled out her comb
her admirable golden hair fell to her knees
what splendid hair
exclaimed the barber
how much will you give me for it
said she
ten france
cut it off
she purchased a knitted petticoats new entity other hence diets
this petticoat made the nhs barriers furious
it was the money that they wanted
they gave the petticoat to epo none
the poor park continued to shiver
f anyone thought my child is no longer coke
i have clothed her with my hair
she put on little round caps which concealed here horn head and in which she was still pretty
dark thoughts held possession off anyone's heart
when she saw that she could no longer dress her hair she began to hate everyone about her
she had long shared the universal veneration for father madeleine yet by dint of repeating to herself that it was he who had discharged her that he was the cause other unhappiness she came to hate him also and most of all
when she passes the factory in working hours when the work people were at the doors be affected to laugh and sing
an old work woman who once saw her laughing and singing in this fashion said there's a girl who will come to a bad end
she took a loved the first who offered a man whom she did not live out of bravado and with rage in her heart
he was a miserable scamp a sort of mendicant musicians is an beggar who beat her and who abandoned her as she had taken him in dust usb
she adores her child
the powers he descended the darker everything grew about her the more radiant stone that little angel at the bottom of her heart
she said when i get rich i will have my cosette with me and she laughed
her court did not leave her and she had sweats on her back
one day she received from the the barriers a letter couched in the following terms cosette is ill with a malady which is going the rounds of the neighborhood
a miliary fever they call it
expensive drugs are required
this is ruining us and we can no longer pay for them
if you do not send us forty france before the week is out the little one will be dead
she burst out laughing and said to her old neighbor am
they are good
forty france
the idea
that makes two napoleon's
where do they think i am to get them
these peasants are stupid truly
nevertheless she went to a dormer window in the staircase and read the letter once more
then she descended the stairs and emerged running and leaping and still laughing
someone met her and said roger what makes you spray
she replied a fine piece of stupidity that some country people have written home
they demand for the dance of me
so much for you you peasants
as she crossed the square she saw a great many people collected around a carriage of eccentric shape up on the top of which stood a man dressed in red who was holding forth
he was a quack dentist in his rounds who was offering to the public full sets of teeth opiates powders and elixirs
fan time mingled in the group and began to laugh with the rest at the harangue which contained slang for the populace and jargon for respectable people
the tooth pulled espied the lovely laughing girl and suddenly exclaimed you have beautiful teeth you girl there who are laughing if you want to sell me your palettes i will give you a good napoleon a piece for them
what's rent palettes
asked fan time
the palettes replied the dental professor are the front teeth the two upper ones
how horrible
exclaimed ranting
two napoleon's
grumbled a toothless old woman who was present
here'sa lucky girl
fan time fled and stopped her ears that she might not hear the hoarse voice of the man shouting to her reflect mybeauty
two napoleons they may prove of service
if your heart bids you come this evening to the inn of the hill asd' argent you will find me there
fan time returned home
she was furious and related the occurrence to her good neighbor marguerite can you understand such a thing
is he not an abominable man
how can they allow such people to go about the country
pull out my two front teeth
why i should be horrible
my hair will grow again but my teeth
ah
what a monster of a man
i should prefer to throw myself head first of the pavement from the fifth story
he told me that he should be at the top pasd' argent this evening
and what did he offer
asked marguerite
two napoleon's
that makes forty brands
yes said fan time that makes forty france
she remained thoughtful and began her work
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour she left her sewing and went to read the the married a' letter once more on the staircase
on her returns he said to marguerite who was at work beside her what is a miliary fever
do you know
yes answered the old spinster it is a disease
does it require many drugs
oh
terrible drugs
how does one get it
it is a malady than one gets without knowing how
then it attacks children
children in particular
so people die of it
they may said marguerite
fan time left the room and went to read her letter once more on the staircase
that evening she went out and was seen to turn her steps in the direction of the rue de paris where the ings are situated
the next morning when marguerite entered fait une's room before daylight for they always worked together and in this manner used only one candle for the two she found fan time seated on her bed pale and frozen
she had not lain down
her cap had fallen on her knees
her candle had burned all night and was almost entirely consumed
marguerite halted on the threshold petrified at this tremendous wastefulness and exclaimed lord
the candle is all burned out
something has happened
then she looked at f anyone who turned toward her her head bereft of its hair
f anyone had grown ten years older since the preceding night
jesus
said marguerite what is the matter with you can find
nothing replied fan time
quite the contrary
my child will not die of that frightful malady for lack of succor
i am content
so saying she pointed out to the spinster two napoleon's which were glittering in the table
qh
jesus god
dried marguerite
why it is a fortune
where did you get those louisd' or
i got them replied can find
at the same time she smiled
the candle illuminated her countenance
it was a bloody smile
a reddish saliva soiled the corners of her lips and she had a black hole in her mouth
the two teeth had been extracted
she sent the forty france to mont vermeil
after all it was a rise of the the barriers to obtain money
cosette was not ill
fan time threw her mirror out of the window
she had long since quitted her cell on the second floor for an attic with only a patch to fasten it next the roof one of those attics whose extremity forms an angle with the floor and knocks you on the head every instant
the poor occupant can reach the end of his chamber as he can the end of his destiny only by bending over more and more
she had no longer and sarah which she called her coverlet a mattress on the floor and as far less chair still remained
a little rose bush which she had had dried up forgotten in one corner
in the other corner was a butter pot to hold water which froze in winter and in which the various levels of the water remained long marked by these circles of ice
she had lost her shame she lost her coquet ry
's final sign
she went out with dirty caps
whether from lack of time or from indifference she no longer mended her linen
as the heels wore out she dragged her stockings down into her shoes
this was evident from the perpendicular wrinkles
she patched her bodice which was old and worn out with scraps of calico which more at the slightest movement
the people to whom she was indebted made scenes and gave her no peace
she found them in the streets he found them again on her staircase
she passes many a night weeping and thinking
her eyes were very bright and she felt a steady pain in her shoulder towards the top of the left shoulder blade
she coughed a great deal
she deeply hated father madeleine but made no complaint
she sewer seventeen hours away but a contractor for the work of prisons who made the prisoner's work at a discount suddenly made prices fall which reduces the daily earnings of working women to nine sous
seventeen hours of toil and nine sousa day
her creditors were more pitiless than ever
the second hand dealer who had taken back nearly all his furniture said to her incessantly when will you pay me you hussy
what did they want other good god
she felt that she was being hunted and something of the wild beast developed in her
about the same time the hardier wrote to her that he had waited with decidedly too much amiability and that he must have a hundred francs at once otherwise he would turn little cosette out of doors convalescent as she was from her heavy illness into the cold and the streets and that she might do what she liked with herself and die if she chose
a hundred francs thought fan time
but in what trade canine earn a hundred sousa day
come
said she let us sell what is left
the unfortunate girl became a woman of the town
chap geral christus his libera but what is this history of fan fine
it is socks by purchasing a slave
from whom
from misery
from hunger cold isolation destitution
a dolorous bargain
a soul for a morsel of bread
misery offers society accepts
the sacred law of jesus christ governs our civilization but it does not as yet permeate if it is said that slavery has disappeared from european civilization
this is a mistake
it still exists but it weighs only upon the woman and it is called prostitution
it weighs up on the woman that is to say upon grace weakness beauty maternity
this is not one of the least of man's disgraces
at the point in this melancholy drama which we have now reached nothing is left for any one of that which she had formerly been
she has become marble in becoming more
whoever touches her feels cold
she passes she ensures you she ignores you she is the severe and dishonored figure
life and the social order have said their last word for her
all has happened to her that will happen to her
she has felt everything borne everything experienced everything suffered everything lost everything mourned everything
she is designed with that resignation which resembles in differences's death resembles sleep
she no longer a voice anything
let all the clouds fall upon her and all the ocean sweep over her
what matters it to bed
she is a sponge that is soaked
at least she believes it to be so but it is an error to imagine that rate can be exhausted and that one has reached the bottom of anything whatever
alas
what are all these rates driven in oslo me k l
whither are they going
why are they thus
he who knows that sees the whole of the shadow
he is alone
his name is god
chapter xii m
bama taboos's inactivity there is in all small towns and there was atm
shrm
in particular a class of young men who nibble away an income of fifteen hundred francs with the same air with which their prototypes devour two hundred thousand francs a year in paris
these are beings of the great neuter species impotent men parasites cyphers who have a little land a little folly a little wit who would be rustics in a drawing room and who think themselves gentlemen in the dram shop who say my fields my peasants my woods who miss actresses at the theatre to prove that they are persons of taste quarrel with the officers of the garrison to prove that they are men of war hunt smoke yawn drink smell of tobacco play billiards stare at travellers as they descend from the diligence live at the cat's finest the inn have a dog which eats the bonds under the table and a mistress who eats the dishes on the table who stick at a so i exaggerate the fashions admire tragedy despise women wear out their old boots copy london through paris and paris through the medium of log famous song so wild as dillard's never work serve house and do no great harm
m
felix tho i oh yes had he remained in his own province and never be held paris would have been one of these men
if they were richer one would say they are candies if they were poorer one would say they are idlers
they are simply men without employment
among these unemployed there are forest he fired dreamers and some knaves
at that period as andy was composed of at all collar a big cravat a watch with trinkets three vests of different colors worn one on top of the other the red and blue inside of a short waisted olive coat with acid fishtail a double row of silver buttons set close to eachother and running up to the shoulder and a pair of trousers of a lighter shade of olive ornamented on the two seams with an indefinite but always uneven number of lines varying from one to eleven a limit which was never exceeded
add to this high shoes with little irons on the heels at all hat with a narrow from hair worn in a gift an enormous fans and conversation set off by pins of porker
overall spurs and a mustache
at that epoch mustaches indicated the bourgeois and spurs the pedestrian
the provincial dandy wore the longest of spurs and the fiercest of mustaches
it was the period of the conflict of the republics of south america with the king of slain of bolivar against morillo
narrow brimmed hats were royalist and were called morillo's liberals word hats with wide brim's which were called bolivars
eight or ten months then after that which is related in the preceding pages towards the first of january on a snowy evening one of these candles one of these unemployed a right thinker to the words morillo and was moreover warmly enveloped in one of those large cloaks which completed the fashionable costume in cold weather was amusing himself by tormenting a creature who was prowling about install dress with neck uncovered and flowers in her hair in front of the officers' cafe
this randy was smiling for he was decidedly fashionable
each time that the woman passed in front of him he bestowed on her together with a puff from his cigar some apostrophe which he considered witty and mirthful such as how ugly you are
will you get out of my sight
you have no teeth
etc.
etc.
this gentleman was known as m
bama taboos
the woman a melancholy decorated spectre which went and came through the snow made him no reply did not even glance at him and nevertheless continued her promenade in silence and with a sombre regularity which brought her every five minutes within reach of this sarcasm like the condemned soldier who returns under the rods
the small effect which he produced no doubt piqued the lounger and taking advantage of a moment when her back was turned he crept up behind her with the gait of a wolf and stifling his laugh bent down picked up a handful of snow from the pavement and thrust in abruptly into her back between her bare shoulders
the woman uttered a road whirled round have a leap like a panther and hurled herself upon the man burying her nails in his face with the most frightful words which could fall from the guard room into the gutter
these insults poured forth in a voice roughened by brandy did indeed process in hideous wise from a mouth which lacked its two front teeth
it was fan time
at the noise thus produced the officers ran out in throngs from the cafe passersby collected and a large and merry circle hooting and applauding was formed around this whirlwind composed of two beings whom there was some difficulty in recognizing as a man and a woman the man struggling hi sharon the ground the woman striking out with feet and gifts bareheaded howling minus hair and teeth livid with wrath horrible
suddenly a man of lofty stature emerged vivaciously from the crowd seized the woman by her saying price which was covered with mud and said to her follow me
the woman raised her head her furious voice suddenly died away
her eyes were glassy she turned pale instead of livid and she trembled with a quiver of terror
she had recognized javert
the dandy took advantage of the incident to make his escape
chapter xiii the solution of some questions connected with the municipal police javert thrust aside the spectators broke the circle and set out with long strides towards the police station which is situated at the extremity of the square dragging the wretched woman after him
she yielded mechanically
neither he nor she uttered a word
the cloud of spectators followed meeting in a paroxysm of delight
supreme misery an occasion for obscenity
on arriving at the police station which was a low rooms armed by a stove with a biased and grated door opening on the street and guarded by a detachment javert opened the door entered with fan time and shut the door behind him to the great disappointment of the curious who raised themselves on tiptoe and cranes their necks in front of the thick glass of the station house in their effort to see
curiosity is a sort of gluttony
to see is to devour
on entering fan time fell down in a corner motionless and mute crouching down like a terrified dog
the sergeant of the guard brought a lighted candle to the table
javert seated himself drew a sheet of stamped paper from his pocket and began to write
this class of women is consigned by our laws entirely to the discretion of the police
the latter do what they please punish them as seems good to them and confiscate at their will those two sorry things which the ten title tue of industry and their liberty
javert was impassive his grave face betrayed no emotion whatever
nevertheless he was seriously and deeply preoccupied
it was one of those moments when he was exercising without control but subject to all the scruples of a severe conscience his redoubtable discretionary power
at that moment he was conscious that his police agent's still was a tribunal
he was entering judgment
he judged and condemned
he summoned all the ideas which could possibly exist in his mind around the great thing which he was doing
the more he examined the deed of this woman the more shocked he felt
it was evident that he had just witnessed the commission of a crime
he had just be held yonder in the street society in the person of a tree holder and an elector insulted and attacked by a creature who was outside all pairs
a prostitute had made an attempt on the life of a citizen
he had seen that he is very
he wrote in silence
when he had finished he signed the paper folded it and said to the sergeant of the guards she handed it to him take three men and conduct this creature to jail
then turning to fan time you are to have six months if it
the unhappy woman shuddered
six months
six months of prison
she exclaimed
six months in which to earn seven sousa day
but what will become of cosette
my daughter
my daughter
but i still owe the the barriers over a hundred francs do you know that monsieur inspector
she dragged her self across the camp floor among the muddy boots of all those men without rising with clasped hands and taking great strides in her knees
monsieur javert said she i beseech your mercy
i assure you that i was not in the wrong
if you had seen the begin ninn you would have seen
i swear to you by the good now that i was not to blame
that gentleman the bourgeois whom i do not know put snow in my back
has anyone the right to put showdown our backs when we are walking along peaceably and doing no harm to anyone
i am rather ill as you see
and then he had been saying impertinent things tone for a long time' you are ugly
you have no teeth
' i know well that i have no longer those teeth
i did nothing i said to myself' the gentleman is amusing himself
' i was honest with him i did not speak to him
it was at that moment that he put the snow down my back
monsieur is very good monsieur inspector
is there not some person here who saw it and can tell you that this is quite true
perhaps i did wrong to get angry
you know that one is not master of one's self at the first moment
one gives way to vivacity and then when someone puts something cold down your back just when you are not expecting it
i did wrong to spoil that gentleman's hat
why did he go away
i would ask his pardon
oh my god
it makes no difference time whether i ask his pardon
done the favor today for this once monsieur have ft
good
you do not know that in prison one can earn only seven sousa day it is not the government's fault but seven sous is one's earnings and just fancy i must pay one hundred francs of my little girl will be sent to me
oh my god
i can not have her with me
what i do is so vile
oh my cosette
oh my little angel of the holy virgin
what will become other poor creature
i will tell you it is the then at clerc innkeepers peasants and such people are unreasonable
they want money
don't put me in prison
you see there is a little girl who will be turned out into the street to get a long as best she may in the very heart of the winter and you must have pity on such a being my good monsieur javert
if she were older she might earn her living but it can not be done at that are
i am not a bad woman at bottom
it is not toward lu news and gluttony that have made me what i am
if i have drunk brandy it was out of misery
i do not love it but it be numbs the senses
when i was happy it was only necessary to glance into my closets and it would have been evident that i was not a coquettish and in tidy woman
i had linen a great deal of linen
have pity on me monsieur javert
she spoke thus rent in twain shaken with sobs blinded with tears her neck bars wringing her hands and coughing with a dry short cough stammering softly with a voice of agony
great sorrow is a divine and terrible day which trans figures the unhappy
at that moment fan time had become beautiful once more
from time to time she paused and tenderly kissed the police agent's coat
she would have softened a heart of granite buy a heart of wood can not be softened
come
saudi a very i have heard you out
have you entirely finished
you will get six months
now march
the eternal father in person could do nothing more
at these solemn words the eternal father in person could do nothing more she understood that her fate was sealed
she sank down murmuring mercy
javert turned his back
the soldiers seized her by the arms
a few moments earlier a man had entered but no one had paid any need to him
he shut the door leaned his back against it and listened to fab time's despairing supplications
at the instant when the soldiers laid their hands upon the unfortunate woman who would not rise he emerged from the shadow and said one moment if you please
havent raised his eyes and recognized m
madeleine
he removed his hat and saluting him with a sort of aggrieved awkwardness excuse me md
mayor the words nt
mayor produced a curious effect upon fan time
she rose to her feet with one bound like a spectre springing from the earth thrust aside the soldiers with both arms walked straight up hom
madeleine before anyone could prevent her and gazing intently at him with a bewildered air she cried at
so it is you who are m.
lemaire
then she burst into a laugh and spit in his face
m
madeleine wiped his face and said inspector javert set this woman at liberty
javert felt that he was on the verge of going mad
he experienced at that moment blow upon blow and almost simultane ously the most violent emotions which he had ever undergone in all his life
to see a woman of the town spit in the mayor's face was a thing so monstrous that in his most daring flights of fancy he would have regarded it as a sacrilege to believe it possible
on the other hand at the very bottom of his thought he made a hideous comparisons x to what this woman was and as to what this may or might be and the nhs with horror caught a glimpse of i know not what simple explanation of this prodigious attack
but when he be held that may or that magistrate calmly wipe his face and say set this woman at liberty he underwent a sort of intoxication of amazement thought and word called him equally the sum total of possible astonishment had been exceeded in his case
he remained mute
the words had produced no less strange an effect on bantine
she raised her bare arm and clung to the damper of the stone like a person who is reeling
never the less she glanced about her and began to speak in a low voice as though talking to herself at liberty
i am to be allowed to go
i am not to go to prison for six months
who said that
it is not possible that anyone could have said that
i did not hear a right
it can not have been that monster of a major
was it you my good monsieur javert who said that i was to be set free
oh see here
i will tell you about it and you will let me go
that monster of a mayor that old black guard of a major is the cause of all
just imagine monsieur javert he turned me out
all because of a lack of rascally women who gossip in the workroom
if that is not a horror what is
to dismiss a poor girl who is doing her work honestly
then i could no longer earn enough and all this misery followed
in the first place there is one improvement which these gentlemen of the police ought to make and that is to prevent prison contractors from wringing poor people
i will explain it to you you see you are earning twelve sousa t shirt making the price falls to nine sous and it is not enough to live on
then one has to become whatever one can
as for me i had my little cosette and i was actually forced to become a bad woman
now you understand how it is that that blackguard of a major causes all the mischief
after that i stamped on that gentleman's hat in front of the officers' cafe but he had spoiled my whole dress with snow
we women have but one silk dress for evening wear
you see that i did not do wrong deliberately truly monsieur javert and everywhere i behold women who are far more wicked than i and who are much happier
o monsieur javert
it was you who gave orders that i am to be set free was it not
make inquiries speak to my landlord i am paying my rent now they will tell you that i am perfectly honest
ag
my god
i beg your pardon i have unintentionally touched the damper of the stove and it has made it smoke
m
madeleine listened to her with profound attention
while she was speaking he fumbled in his waistcoat dfes put his purse and opened it
it was empty
he put it back in his pocket
he said tocantins how much did you say that you owed
f anyone who was looking at ja very only turned towards him was i speaking to you
then addressing the sol ridgeway you fellows did you see how i spit in his face
ag
you old wretch of a mayor you came here to frighten me but i'm not afraid of you
i am afraid of monsieur javert
i am afraid of my good monsieur javert
so saying she turned to the inspector again and yet you see me
inspector it is necessary to be just
i understand that you are just me
inspector in fact it is perfectly simple am an amused himself by putting showdown a woman's back and that makes the officers laugh one must divert themselves in some way and we sell we are here for them to amuse themselves with ofcourse
and then you you come you are certainly obliged to preserve order you lead off the woman who is in the wrong but on reflection since you are a good man you say that i am to be set at liberty it is for the sake of the little one for six months in prison would prevent my supporting my child
' onlydon'ts out again you hussy
' oh
idon't do it again monsieur javert
they may do whatever they please time now i will not stir
but today you see i cried because it hurt me
i was not expecting that snow from the gentleman at all and then as i told you i am not well i have a cough i seem to have a burning ball in my stomach and the doctor tells me' take care of yourself
' here feel give me your handdon't be afraid it is here
she no longer we other voice was caressing she placed javert's coarse hand on her deliv str white throat and looked smilingly at him
all at once she rapidly adjusted her disordered garments dropped the folds of her skirt which has been pushed up as she dragged her self along almost to the height of her knee and stepped towards the door saying to the soldiers in a low voice and with a friendly now children monsieurl' inspecteur has said that i am to be released and i am going
she laid her hand on the latch of the door
one step more and she would be in the street
javert up to that moment had remained erect motionless with his eyes fixed on the ground cast athwart this scene like some displaced statue which is waiting to be put away somewhere
the sound of the latch roused him
he raised his head with an expression of sovereign authority an expression all the more alarming in proportion as the authority rests on a low level ferocious in the wild beast atrocious in the man of no estate
sergeant
he crieddon't you see that that jade is walking off
who have you letter to
i said madeleine
fan time trembled at the sound of javert's voice and let go of the latches a thief relinquished the article which he has stolen
at the sound of madeleine's voice she turned around and from that moment forth she uttered no word god cares so much as to great is freely but her glance strayed from madeleine to javert and from javert to madeleine in turn according to which was speaking
it was evident that is very must have been exasperated beyond measure before he would permit himself to a post room iaw the sergeant as he had done after the mayor's suggestion that can find should be set at liberty
had he reached the point of forgetting the mayor's presence
had he finally declared to himself that it was impossible that any authority should have given such an order and that the mayor must certainly have said one thing by mistake for another without intending it
or in view of the enorm ities of which he had been a witness for the past two hours did he say to himself that it was nec essary to recur to supreme resolutions that it was indispensable that the small should be made great that the police spy should transform himself into a magistrate that the policeman should become a dispenser of justice and that in this prodigious extremity order law morality government society in its entirety was personified in him javert
however that maybe when m
karel done uttered that word i as we have just heard police inspector javert was seen to turn toward the mayor pale cold with blue lips and a look of despair his whole body agitated by an imperceptible quiver and an unprecedented occurrence and say to him with downcast eyes but a firm voice mr
mayor that can not be
why not
said m
madeleine
this miserable woman had insulted a citizen
inspector javert replied the mayor in a calm and con cilia ringtone listen
you are an honest man and i feel no hesitation in explaining matters to you
here is the true state of the case i was passing through the square just as you were leaving this woman away there were still groups of people standing about and i have inquiries and learned everything it was the towns man who was in the wrong and who should have been arrested by properly conducted police
javert retorted this wretch has just insulted monsieur lemaire
that concerns he said m
madeleine
my own insult belongs to me i think
i can do what i please about it
i beg monsieur lemaire's pardon
the insult is not to him but to the law
inspector javert replied j
madeleine the highest law is conscience
i have heard this woman i know what i am doing
and i'm r
mayor do not know what i see
then content yourself with obeying
i am obeying my duty
my duty demands that this woman shall serve six months in prison
m
madeleine replied gently used this well she will not serve a single day
at this decisive word javert ventured to fix a searching look on the mayor and to say but in at one of voice that was still profoundly respectful i am sorry to oppose monsieur lemaire it is for the first time in my life but he will permit me to remark that i am within the bounds of my authority
i confine myself since monsieur lemaire desires it to the question of the gentleman
i was present
this woman flung herself on monsieur nakata bnp is who is an elector and the proprietor of that handsome house with a balcony which forms the corner of the esplanade three stories high and entirely of cut stone
such things as there are in the world
in any case monsieur lemaire this is a question of police regulations in the streets and concerns me and i shall retain this woman fan time
then m
madeleine folded his arms and said in a severe voice which no one in the town had heard hitherto the matter to which you refer is one connected with the municipal police
according to the terms of articles nine eleven fifteen and sixty six of the code of criminal examination i am the judge
i order that this woman shall be set at liberty
javert ventured to make a final effort
but mr
mayor i refer you to article eighty one of the law of the th of december in regard to arbitrary detention
monsieur lemaire permit me not another word
but leave the room said m
madeleine
javert received the blow erect fill in the face in his breast like a russian soldier
he bowed to the very earth before the mayor and left the room
fan time stood aside from the door and stared at him in amazement as he passed
nevertheless she also was the prey to a strange confusion
she had just seen herself a subject of dispute between two opposing powers
she had seen two men who held in their hands her liberty her life her soul her child in combat before her very eyes one of these men was drawing her towards darkness the other was leaving her back towards the light
in this conflict viewed through the exaggerations of terror these two men had appeared to her like two giants the one spoke like her denon the other like her good angel
the angel had conquered the demon and strange to say that which made her shudder from head to go it was the fact that this angel this liberator was the very man whom she abhorred that may or whom she had so long regarded as the author of all her woes that madeleine
and at the very moment when she had insulted him in so hideous a fashion he had saved her
had she then been mistaken
must due change her whole soul
she did not know she trembled
she listened in bewilderment she looked on in affright and at every word uttered by k
madeleine she felt the frightful shades of hatred crumble and melt within her and something warm and under able indescribable which was both joy confidence and love dawn in her heart
when javert had taken his departure m
madeleine turned to her and said to her in a deliberate voice like a serious man who does not wish to weep and who finds some difficulty in speaking i have heard you
i knew nothing about what you have mentioned
i believe that it is true and i feel that it is true
i was even ignorant of the fact that you had left my shop
why did you not apply to me
but here i will lay your debts i will send for your child or you shall go to her
you shall live here in paris or where you please
i undertake the care of your child and yourself
you shall not work any longer if you do not like
i will give all the money you require
you shall be honest and happy once more
and listen
i declare to you that if all is as you say and i do not doubt if you have never ceased to be virtuous and holy in the sight of god
oh
poor woman
this was more than fan time could bear
to have cosette
to leave this life of infamy
topics freedict happy respectable with cosette to see all these realities of paradise blossom of a sudden in the midst of her misery
she stared stupidly at this man who was talking to her and could only give vent to two or three dobson
oh
oh
her limbs gave way beneath her she knelt in front of m
madeleine and before he could prevent her he felt her grasp his hand and press her lips to it
then she fainted
book sixth
javert chapter i. the beginning of repose m
madeleine had fan to be removed to that infirmary which he had established in his own house
he confided her to the sisters who put her to bed
a burning fever had come on
she passed a part of the night in delirium and raving
at length however she fell asleep
on the morrow towards midday fan time awoke
she heard someone breathing close to her bed she drew aside the curtain and saw m
madeleine standing there and looking at something over her head
his gaze was full of pity anguish and supplication
she followed its direction and saw that it was fixed on a crucifix which was hauled to the wall
thenceforth m
madeleine was transfigured infant one's eyes
he seemed to her to be clothed in light
he was absorbed in a sort of prayer
she gazed at him for a long time without daring to interrupt him
at last she said timidly what are you doing
m
madeleine has been there for an hour
he had been waiting for fan time to awake
he took her hand felt other pulse and replied how do you feel
well i have slept she replied i think that i am better it is nothing
he answered responding to the first question which she had put to him as though he had just heard it i was praying to the martyr there on high
and he added in his own mind for the martyr here below
m
madeleine had passed the night and the morning in making inquiries
he knew all now
he knew can find's history in all its heartrending details
he went on you have suffered much poor mother
oh
do not complain you now have the diary of the elect
it is thus that men are transformed into angels
it is not their fault they do not know how to go to work otherwise
you see this help from which you have just emerged is the first form of heaven
it was necessary to begin there
he sighed deeply
but she smiled on him with that sublime smile in which two teeth were lacking
that same night javert wrote a letter
the next morning be posted it himself at the office of m
shrm
it was addressed to paris and the superscript ion ran to monsieur chan ohio let secretary of monsieur le prefer of police
as the affair in the station house had been fruited about the post mistress and some other persons who saw the letter before it was sent off and who recognized javert's handwriting on the cover thought that he was sending in his resignation
m
madeleine made haste to write to the the barriers
fan time owed them one hundred and twenty france
he sent them three hundred francs telling them to pay themselves from that sum and to fetch the child instantly tom
shrm
where her sick mother required her presence
this dazzled the barrier
the devil
said the man to his wifedon't let's allow the child to go
this park is going to turn into a mulch cow
i see through it
women in my has taken a fancy to the mother
he replied with a very well drawn up bill for five hundred and some odd francs
in this memorandum two indisputable items figured up over three hundred francs one for the doctor the other for the apothecary who had attended and physico deep in one and a selma through two long illnesses
cosette as we have already said had not been ill
it was only a question of a trifling substitution of names
at the foot of the memorandum the barrier wrote received on account three hundred francs
m
madeleine immediately sent three hundred francs more and wrote make haste to bring cosette
christi
said the barrier let's not give up the child
in the meantime fanti he did not recover
she still remained in the infirmary
the sisters had at first only received and nursed that woman with repugnance
those who have seen the nws reliefs of rheims will recall the inflation of the lower lip of the wise virgins as they survey the foolish virgins
the ancient scorn of the best als for the ambu bajar is one of the most profound instincts of feminine dignity the sisters felt it with the double force contributed by religion
but in a few days fan time disarmed them
she said all kinds of humble and gentle things and the mother in her provoked tenderness
one day the sisters heard her say amid here ever i have been a sinner but when i have my child beside me it will be a sign that god has pardoned me
while i was leading a bad life i should not have liked to have my cosette with me i could not have borne her was astonished dyes
it was for her sake that i did evil and that is why god pardons me
i shall feel the bene diction of the good god when cosette is here
i shall gas father it will come good to see that innocent creature
she knows nothing at all
she is an angel you see my sisters
at that are the wings have not fallen off
m
madeleine went to see her twice a day and each time she asked him shall i see my cosette soon
he answered tomorrow perhaps
she may arrive at any moment
i am expecting her
and the mother's pale face grew radiant
oh
she said how happy i am going to be
we have just said that she did not recover her health
on the contrary her condition seemed to become more grave from week to week
that handful of snow applied to her bare skin between her shoulder blades had brought about a sudden suppression of perspiration as a consequence of which the malady which had been smouldering within her for many years was violently developed at last
at that time people were beginning to follow the fine lawn nec's fine suggestions in the study and treatment of chest maladies
the doctor sounded can find's chest and shook his head
m
madeleine said to the doctor well
has she got a child which she desires to see
said the doctor
yes
well
make haste and get it here
m
madeleine shuddered
fan time inquired what did the doctor say
m
madeleine forced himself to smile
he said that your child was to be brought speedily
that that would restore your health
oh
where joined he is right
but what do those the barriers mean by keeping my cosette from me
pt
she is coming
atlas five hold happiness close beside me
in the meantime the barrier did not let go of the child and gave a hundred in sufficient reasons for it
cosette was not quite well enough to take a journey in the winter
and then there still remained some petty but pressing debts in the neighborhood and they were collecting the bills for them etc.
etc.
i shall send someone to fetch cosette
said father madeleine
if necessary i will go myself
he wrote the following letter for anyone's dictation and made her sign it monsieur the barrier you will deliver cosette to this person
you will be paid for all the little things
i have the honor to salute you with respect
bantine
in the meantime a serious incident occurred
carte as we will the mysterious block of which our life is made the black vein of destiny constantly reappears in it
chapter ii how jean may become champ one morning m
madeleine was on his study occupied in arranging in advance some pressing matters connected with the mayor's office in case he should decide to take the trip to mind vermeil when he was informed that police inspector javert was desirous of speaking with him
madeleine could not refrain from a disagreeable impress uk non hearing this name
nader that avoided him more than ever since the affair of the police station and m
madeleine had not seen him
admit him he said
javert entered
m
madeleine had retained his seat near the fire pen in hand his eyes fixed in the docket which he was turning over and annotating and which contained the trials of the commission on highways for the infraction of police regulations
he did not disturb himself on javert's account
he could not help thinking of poor fan time and it suited him to be glacial in his manner
javert bestowed a respect rules lite on the mayor whose back was turned to him
the mayor did not look at him but went on annotating this docket
javert advanced two or three paces into the study and halted without breaking the silence
if any physio gnomish who had been familiar with javert and who had made a lengthy study of this savage in the service of civilization this singular composite of the roman the spartan the monk and the corporal this spy who was incapable of a lie this unspotted police agent if any physio gnomish had known his secret and long cherished a version form
madeleine his conflict with the mayor on the subject off anyone and had examined have that that moment he would have said to himself what has taken place
it was evident to anyone acquainted with that clear up right sincere honest austere and ferocious conscience that is very bad but just gone through some great interior struggle
javert had nothing in his soul which he had not also in his countenance
like violent people in general he was subject to abrupt changes of opinion
his physiognomy had never been more peculiar and startling
on entering he bowed to m
madeleine with a look in which there was neither rancor anger not distrust he halted a few paces in the rear of the mayor's arm chair and there he stood perfectly erect in an attitude almost of discipline with the cold ingenuous roughness of a man who has never been gentle and who has always been patient he waited without uttering a word without making a movement in f engine humility and tranquil resignation calm serious gating and with eyes cast down and an expression which was halfway between that of a soldier in the presence of his offices and a criminal in the presence of his judge until it should please the mayor to turn round
all the sentiments as well as all the memories which one might have attributed to him had disappeared
that face as impenetrable and simple as granite no longer bore any trace of anything but a melancholy depression
his whole person breathed lowliness and firmness and an indescribable courageous despondency
at last the mayor laid down his pen and turned half round
well
what is it
what is the matter javert
javert remained silent for an instant as though collecting his ideas then raised his voice with a sort of sad solemnity which did not however preclude simplicity
this is the matter mr
mayor a culpable act has been committed
what act
an inferior agent of the authorities has failed in respect and in the gravest manner towards a magistrate
i have come to bring the fact to your knowledge as it is my duty to do
who is the agent
asked h
madeleine
i said is very
you
i
and who is the magistrate who has reason to complain of the agent
young
mayor
m
madeleine sat erect in his armchair
javert went on with a severe air and his eyes still cast down
mr
mayor i have come to request you to instigate the authorities to dismiss me
m
madeleine opened his mouth in amazement
javert interrupted him you will say that i might have handed in my resignation but that does not suffice
handing in one's resignation is honorable
i have failed in my duty i ought to be punished i must be turned out
and after a pause he added mr
mayor you were severe with me the other day and unjustly
be so today with justice
come now
why
exclaimed m
madeleine
what nonsense is this
what is the meaning of this
what culpable act have you been guilty of towards me
what have you done home
what are yours rings with regard to me
you accuse yourself you wish to be superseded turned out said javert
turned out so it be then
that is well
i do not understand
you shall understand me
mayor
javert sighed from the very bottom of his chest and resumed still coldly and sadly mr
mayor six weeks ago in consequence of the scene over that woman i was furious and i informed against you
informed against me
at the prefecture of police in paris
m
madeleine who was not in the habit of laughing much oftener than javert himself burst out laughing now as a major who had encroached on the province of the police
as an ex convict
the mayor turned livid
javert who had not raised his eyes went on i thought it was so
i had had an idea for a long time a resemblance inquiries which you had caused to be made at face rolled the strength of your loins the adventure with old rauch elegant your skill in marksmanship your pet which you drag a little i hardly know what all absurdities
but at all events i took you for a certain jean valjean
a certain what did you say the name was
jean valjean
he was a convict whom i was in the habit of seeing twenty years ago when i was adjutant guard of convicts at toulon
on leaving the galleys this jean valjean as it appears robbed a bishop then he committed another theft accompanied with violence on a public high wagon the person of a little savoyard
he disappeared eight years ago no one knows how and he had been sought i fancied
in short i did this thing
wrath impelled mem denounced you at the prefecture
m
madeleine who had taken up the docket again several moments before this resumed with an air of perfect indifference and what reply did you receive
that i was mad
well
well they were right
it is lucky that you recognize the fact
i am forced to do so since the real jean valjean has been found
the sheet of paper which m
madeleine was holding dropped from his hand he raised his head based fixedly at javert and said with his indescribable accent am
javert continued this is the way it is mr.
mayor
it seems that there was in the neighborhood near silky legs utc locher an old fellow who was called father champ mathieu
he was a very wretched creature
no one paid any attention to him
no one knows what such people subsist on
lately last autumn father champ mathieu was arrested for the theft of some cider apples from well no matter a theft had been committed a wall scaled branches of trees broken
my champ mathieu was arrested
he still had the branch of apple tree in his hand
the scamp is locked up
up to this point it was merely an affair of a misdemeanor
but here is where providence intervened
the jail being in a bad condition the examining magistrate finds it convenient to transfer champ mathieu to areas where the departmental prison is situated
in this prison at areas there is an ex convict named brevet who is detained for i know not what and who has been appointed turnkey of the house because of good behavior
mr
mayor no sooner had champ mathieu arrived than brevet exclaims' em
why i know that man
he is a favor
make a good look at me my goodman
you are jean valjean
'' jean valjean
who's jean valjean
' champ mathieu reigns astonishment
'don't play the innocent dodge' says btec e h
' you are jean valjean
you have been in the valleys of toulon it was twenty years ago we were there together
' champ mathieu denies it
par bleu
you understand
the case is investigated
the things as well ventilated for me
this is what they discovered this champ mathieu had been thirty years ago a primer of trees in various localities notably at face rolled
there all trace of him was lost
a long time afterwards he was seen again in auvergne then in paris where he is said to have been a wheelwright and to have had a daughter who was a laundress but that has not been proved
now before going to the galleys for theft what was jean valjean
a pruned of trees
where
at face rolled
another fact
this valjean's christian name was jean and his mother's surname was mathieu
what more natural to suppose than that on emerging from the valley she should have taken his mother's name for the purpose of concealing himself and have called himself jean mathieu
he goes to auvergne
the local pronunciation turns jean into change is called chan mathieu
our man offers no opposition and behold him transformed into champ mathieu
you follow me do you not
inquiries were made at face rolled
the family of jean valjean is no longer there
it is not known where they have gone
you know that among those classes a family often disappears
search was made and nothing was found
when such people are not mud they are dust
and then as the beginning of the story dates thirty years back there is no longer anyone at favero olds who knew jean valjean
inquiries were made at toulon
besides brevet there are only two convicts in existence who have seem jean valjean they are coche paulie and chen il dish and are sentenced for life
they are taken from the valleys and confronted with the pretended champ mathieu
they do not hesitate he is jean valjean for them as well as for brevet
the same age he is fifty four the same height the same air the same man in short it is he
it was precisely at this moment that i forwarded my denunciation to the prefecture in paris
i was told that i had lost my reason and that jean valjean is at areas in the power of the authorities
you can imagine whether this surprised me when i thought that i had that same jean valjean here
i write to the examining judge he sense for me champ mathieu is conducted home sell
interposed m
madeleine
javert replied his face incorruptible and as melancholy as ever nr
mayor the truth is the truth
i am sorry but that man is jean valjean
i recognized him also
m
madeleine resumed in a very low voice you are sure
javert began to laugh with that mournful laugh which comes from profound conviction
o
sure
he stood there thoughtfully for a moment mechanically taking pinches of powdered wood for blotting ink from the wooden bowl which stood on the table and he added and even now that i have seen the real jean valjean i do not see how i could have thought otherwise
i beg your pardon me
mayor
javert as he addressed these brave and supp locating words to the man who six weeks before had humiliated him in the presence of the whole station house and bade him leave the room is very that haughty man was unconsciously full of simplicity and dignity m
madeleine made no other reply to his prayer than the abrupt question and what does this man say
aj
indeed mr
mayorit'sa bad business
if he is jean valjean he has his previous conviction against him
to climb a wall to break's branch to our poin apples is a mischievous trick in a child for a man it is a misdemeanor for a convict it is a crime
robbing and housebreaking it is all there
it is no longer a question of correctional police it is a matter for the court of assizes
it is no longer a matter of a few days in prison it is the galleys for life
and then there is the affair with the little savoyard who will return i hope
the drive
there is plenty to dispute in the matter is there not
yes for anyone but jean valjean
but jean valjean is as lyd og
that is the way i recognized him
any other man would have felt that things were getting hot for him he would struggle he would cry out the kettle songs before the fire he would not be jean valjean etcetera
but he has not the appearance of understanding he says' i am champ mathieu and idon't depart from that
' he has an astonished air he pretends to be stupid it is far better
oh
the rogue is clever
but it makes no difference
the proofs are there
he has been recognized by four persons the kids camp will be condemned
the case has been taken to the assizes at areas
i shall not here to give my testimony
i have been summoned
m
madeleine had turned to his desk again and taken up his docket and was turning over the leaves tranquilly reading and writing by turns like a busy man
he turned to javert that will do javert
in truth all these details interest me but little
we are wasting our time and we have pressing business on hand
javert you will be take yourself at once to the house of the woman buses upper who sells herbs at the corner of the rue saint's silve
you will tell her that she must enter her complaint against carter pierre she's belong
the man is a brute who came near crushing this woman and her child
he must be punished
you will then go to m
char cells true montes de champigny
he complained that there is a gutter on the adjoining house which discharges rainwater on his premises and is undermining the foundations of his house
after that you will verify the infractions of police regulations which have been reported to me in the rueful bourg st widow doris's and the sugar ray d blanca the same renee legos we'd and you will prepare documents
but i am giving you a great deal of work
are you not to be absent
did you not tell me that you were going to a reason that matter in a week or ten days
sooner than that mr.
mayor
on what day then
why i thought that i had said to monsieur le'm sure that the case was to be tried tomorrow and that i am to set out by diligence tonight
m
madeleine made an imperceptible movement
and how long will the case last
one day at the most
the judgment will be pronounced tomorrow evening at latest
but i shall not wait for the sentence which is certain i shall return here as soon as my deposition has been taken
that is well said m
madeleine
and he dismissed javert with a wave of the hand
javert did not withdraw
excuse me md
mayor said he
what is it now
demanded m
madeleine
mr
mayor there is still something of which i must remind you
what is it
that i must be dismissed
n
madeleine rose
javert you are a man of honor and i esteem you
you exaggerate your fault
moreover this is an offence which concerns me
javert you deserve promotion instead of degradation
i wish you to retain your post
javert gazed at m
madeleine with his candid eyes in whose depth dh is not very enlightened but pure and girls conscience seemed visible and said in a tranquil voice mr
mayor i can not grant you that
i repeat replied m
madeleine that the matter concerns me
but javert needing his own thought only continued so far as exaggeration is concerned i am not exaggerating
this is the way i reason i have suspected you unjustly
that is nothing
it is our right to cherish suspicion although suspicion directed above ourselves is an abuse
but without proofs in a bit of rage with the object of wreaking my vengeance i have denounced you as a convict you a respectable man a mayor a magistrate
that is serious very serious
i have insulted authority in your person jan agent of the authorities
if one of my subordinates had done what i have done i should have declared him unworthy of the service and have expelled him
well
stop me
mayor one word more
i have often been severe in the course of my life towards others
that is just
i have done well
now if i were not severe towards myself all the justice that i have done would become injustice
ought i to spare myself more than others
no
what
i should be good for nothing but to chastise others and not myself
why i should be a blackguard
those who say' that blackguard of a is very
' would be in the right
mr
mayor i do not desire that you should treat me kindly your kindness roused sufficient bad blood in me when it was directed to others
i want none of it for myself
the kindness which consists in upholding a woman of the town against a citizen the police agent against the mayor the man who is down against the man who is upon the world is what i call false kindness
that is the sort of kindness which disorganized society
good god
it is very easy to be kind the difficulty lies in being just
come
if you had been what i thought you i should not have been kind to you go to
you would have seen
mt
mayor i must treat myself as i would treat any other man
when i have subdued malefactors when i have proceeded with big or against rascals i have often said to myself' if you flinch if i ever catch you in fault you may rest at your ease
' i have clinched i have caught myself in a fault
so much the worse
come discharged cashiered expelled
that is well
i have arms
i will till the soil it makes no difference to me
mr
mayor the good of the service demands an example
i simply require the discharge of inspector javert
all this was uttered in a proud humble despairing yet convinced tone which lent indescribable grandeur to this singular honest man
we shall see said m
madeleine
and he offered him his hand
javert recoiled and said in a wild voice excuse me md
mayor but this must not be
a major does not offer his hand to a police spy
he added between his teeth a police spy yes from the moment when i have misused the police
i am no more than a police spy
then he vowed profoundly and directed his steps towards the door
there he wheeled round and with eyes still downcast mr
mayor he said i shall continue to serve until i am superseded
he withdrew
m
madeleine remained thoughtfully listening to the firm sure step which died away on the pavement of the corridor
book seventh
the champ mathieu affair chapter i sisters implode the incidents the reader is about to peruse were not all known atm
shrm
but the small portion of them which became known left such a memory in that town that a serious gap would exist in this book if we did not narrate them in their most minute details
among these details the reader will encounter two or three improbable circumstances which we preserve out of respect for the truth
on the afternoon following the visitor have rtm
madeleine went to see fan time according to his wont
before entering can find's room he had sisters implode summoned
the two nuns who performed the services of nurse in the infirmary lazarus he ladies like all sisters of charity bore the names of sister per le tue and sisters imp life
sister per per he was an ordinary villagers sister of charity in a coarse style who had entered the service of god as one enters any other service
she was a nun as other women are cooks
this type is not so very rare
the monastic orders gladly accept this heavy peasant earthenware which is easily fashioned into a capuchin or an ursuline
these rustics are utilized for the rough work of devotion
the transition from a driver to a carmelite is not in the least violent the one turns into the other without much effort the fund of ignorance common to the village and the cloister is a preparation ready at hand and places the good at once on the same footing as the monk a little more amplitude in the shock and it becomes a frock
sister per pet he was a robust jun from marines next pontoise who chartered her park is droned grumbled sugared the potion according to the bigotry of the hypocrisy of the invalid treated her patients abruptly roughly was stabbed with the dying almost flung god in their faces stoned their death agony with prayers mumbled in a rate was bold honest and buddy
sister simplices as white with a waxen pallor
beside sister per le tue she was the taper beside the candle
vincent depaul has divinely traced the features of the sister of charity in these admirable words in which he mingles as much freedom as servitude they shall have for their convent only the house of the sick for cell only a hired room for chapel only their parish church for cloister only the streets of the town and the wards of the hospital e for enclosure only obedience for gratings only the fear of god for veil only modesty
this ideal was realized in the living person or sister simplices he had never been young and it seemed as though she would never grow old
no one could have told sisters implode's age
she was a person wed are not say a woman who was gentle austere well bred cold and who had never lied
she was so gentle that she appeared fragile but she was more solid than granite
she touched the unhappy with fingers that were charmingly pure and fine
there was so to speak silence in her speech she said just what was necessary and she possessed at one of voice which would have equally edified a confessional or enchanted a drawing room
this delicacy accommodated itself to the server own finding in this harsh contact a continual reminder of heaven and of god
let us emphasize one detail
never to have lied never to have said for any interest whatever even in indifference any single thing which was not the truth the sacred truth was sisters implode's distinctive trait it was the ascent of her virtue
she was almost renowned in the congregation for this imperturbable veracity
the abbe sicard speaks of sisters implode in a letter to the death item assisi
however pure and sincere we maybe we all bear upon our candor the crack of the little innocent lie
she did not
little lie innocent lie does such a thing exist
to lie is the absolute form of evil
to lie a little is not possible new holmes lies the whole lie
to lie is the very face of the demon
satan has two names he is called satan and lying
that is what she thought and as she thought so she did
the result was the whiteness which we have mentioned a whiteness which covered even her lips and her eyes with radiance
her smile was white her glance was white
there was not a single spider's web not a grain of dust in the glass window of that conscience
on entering the order of saint vincent depaul she had taken the name of simp life by special choice
simp life of sicily as we know is the saint who preferred to allow both her breasts to be torn off rather than to say that she had been born at segesta when she had been born at syracuse a lie which would have saved her
this patron saint suited this soul
sisters implode on her entrance into the order had had two faults which she had gradually correct cd she had a taste for dainties and she liked to receive letters
she never read anything but a book of prayers printed in latin on coarse type
she did not understand latin but she understood the book
this pious woman had conceived an affection for bantine probably feeling a latent virtue there and she had devoted herself almost exclusively to her care
m
madeleine took sisters in olive apart and recommended want one to her in a singular tone which the sister recalled later on
on leaving the sister he approached fan time
fan time awaited m
madeleine's appearance every day as one awaits a day of warmth and joy
she said to the sisters i only live when monsieur lemaire is here
she had a great deal of fever that day
as soon as she's a am
madeleine she asked him and cosette
he replied with a smile soon
m
madeleine was the same as usual with ranting
only he remained an hour instead of half an hour for anyone's great delight
he urged everyone repeatedly not to allow the invalid to want for anything
it was noticed that there was a moment when his countenance became very sombre
but this was explained when it became known that the doctor had bent down to his ear and said to him she is losing ground fast
then he returned to the town hall and the clerk observed him attentively examining a roadmap of france which hung in his study
he wrote a few figures on a bit of paper with a pencil
chapter ii the perspicacity of masters cake claire from the town hall he betook himself to the extremity of the town to a fleming named masters caiff last french sc aug claire whole your horses and cabriolet was desired
in order to reach this scaife laird the shortest way was to take the little frequented street in which was situated the parsonage of the parish in which m
madeleine resided
the cure was it was said a worthy respect able and sensible man
at the moment when m
madeleine arrived in front of the parsonage there was but one passerby in the street and this person noticed this after the mayor had passed the priest's house he halted stood motionless then turned about and retraced his steps to the door of the parsonage which had an iron knocker
he laid his hand quickly on the knocker and lifted it then he paused again and stopped short as though in thought and after the lapse of a few seconds instead of allowing the knocker to fall abruptly be placed it gently and resumed his way with a sort of taste which had not been apparent previously
m
madeleine found masters cake claire at home engaged in stitching a harness over
master's cake claire he inquired have you a good horse
mr
mayor said the fleming all my horses are good
what do you mean by a good horse
i mean a horse which can travel twenty leagues in a day
the deuce
said the fleming
twenty leagues
yes
hitched to a cabriolet
yes
and how long can be rest at the end of his journey
he must be able to set out again on the next day if necessary
to traverse the same road
yes
the deuce
the deuce
and it is twenty leagues
m
madeleine drew from his pocket the paper on which he had pencilled some figures
he showed it to the fleming
the figures were
you see he said total nineteen and a half as well say twenty leagues
mr
mayor returned the fleming i have just what you want
my little white horse you may have seen him pass occasionally he is a small beast from lower foul on nais
he is full of fire
they wanted to make a saddle horse of him at first
bah
he feared he kicked he laid everybody flat on the ground
he was thought to be vicious and no one knew what to do with him
i bought him
i harnessed him to a carriage
that is what he wanted sir he is as gentle as a girl he goes like the wind
ah
indeed he must not be mounted
it does not suit his ideas to be a saddle horse
everyone has his ambition
' draw
yes
carry
no
' we must suppose that is what he said to himself
and he will accomplish the trip
your twenty leagues all at a full trot and in less than eight hours
but here are the conditions
state then
in the first place you will give him half an hour's breathing spell midway of the road he will eat and someone must be by while he is eating to prevent the stable boy of the inn from stealing his late for i have noticed that in inns the oats are more often drunk by the stable mentha beaten by the horses
someone will baby
in the second place is the cabriolet for monsieur lemaire
yes
does monsieur lemaire know how to drive
yes
well monsieur lemaire will travel alone and without baggage in order not to overload the horse
agreed
but as monsieur leisure will have no one with him he will be obliged to take the trouble himself of seeing that the oats are not stolen
that is understood
i am to have thirty francs a day
the days of rest to be paid total do not a farthing less and the beast's food to beat monsieur lemaire's expense
m
madeleine drew three napoleon's from his purse and laid them on the table
here is the pay for two days in advance
fourthly for such a journey a cabriolet would be too heavy and would fatigue the horse
monsieur lemaire must consent to travel in a little tilbury that i own
i consent to that
it is light but it has no cover
that makes no difference to me
has monsieur lemaire reflected that we are in the middle of winter
m
madeleine did not reply
the fleming resumed that it is very cold
m
madeleine preserved silence
master's cake claire continued that it may rain
m
madeleine raised his head and said the tilbury and the horse will be in front of my door tomorrow morning at half past fouro'clock
of course monsieur lemaire replied sc aug claire then scratching a speck in the wood of the table with his thumbnail he resumed with that careless air which the flemings understand so well how to mingle with their shrewdness but this is what i am thinking it now monsieur lemaire has not told me where he is going
where is monsieur le mal're going
he had been thinking of nothing else since the beginning of the conversation but he did not know why he had not dared to put the question
are your horse's forelegs good
said m
madeleine
yes monsieur lemaire
you must hold him in a little when going downhill
are there many descends between here and the place whither you are going
do not forget to beat my door at precisely half past fouro'clock tomorrow morning replied m
madeleine and he took his departure
the fleming remained utterly stupid as he himself said some time afterwards
the mayor had been gone two or three minutes when the door opened again it was the mayor once more
he still wore the same impassive and preoccupied air
monsieur scaifel' aide said hear what sum do you estimate the value of the horse and tilbury which you are to let tome the one bearing the other
the one dragging the other monsieur lemaire said the fleming with a broad smile
so be it
well
does monsieur lemaire wish to purchase them orme
no but i wish to guarantee you in any case
you shall give me back the sum at my return
at what value do you estimate your horse and cabriolet
five hundred francs monsieur lemaire
here it is
m
madeleine laid a bank bill on the table then left the room and this time he did not return
master's cake claire experienced a frightful regret that he had not said a gulls and brands
besides the horse and tilbury together we're worth but a hundred crowns
the flaming called his wife and related the affair to her
where the devil could monsieur lemaire be going
they held counsel together
he is going to paris said the wife
idon't believe it said the husband
m
madeleine had forgotten the paper with the figures on it and it lay on the chimney piece
the fleming picked it up and studied it
five six right and a half
that must designate the posting relays
he turned to his wife i have found out
what
it is five leagues from here to head in six from head into saint pol eight and a half from saint lol to areas
he is going to areas
meanwhile m
madeleine had returned home
he had taken the longest way to return from masters came claire's as though the parsonage door had been a temptation for him and he had wished to avoid it
he ascended to his room and there he shut himself up which was a very simple act since he liked to go to bed early
nevertheless the port tess of the factory who was at the same time m
madeleine's only servant noticed that the latter's light was extinguished at half past eight and she mentioned it to the cashier when he came home adding is monsieur le hair will
i thought he had a rather sign up a fair
this cashier occupied a room situated directly under m
madeleine's chamber
he paid no need to the port tess's words but went to bed and to sleep
towards midnight he woke up with a start in his sleep he had heard a noise above his head
he listened it was a footstep pacing back and forth as though someone were walking in the room above him
he listened more attentively and recognized m
madeleine's step
this struck him as strange usually there was no noise in m
madeleine's chamber until he rose in the morning
a moment later the cashier hears a noise which resembled that of a cupboard being opened and then shut again then a piece of furniture was dis arranged then a pause ensued then the step began again
the cashier sat up in bed quite awake now and sharing and through his window panes he saw the reddish gleam of a lighted window reflected on the opposite wall from the direct job of the rate it could only come from the window of m
madeleine's chamber
the reflection wavered as though it came rather from a fire which had been lighter than from a candle
the shadow of the window frame was not shown which indicated that the window was wide open
the fact that this window was open in such cold weather was surprising
the cashier fell asleep again
an hour or two later he asked again
the same step was still passing slowly and regularly back and forth overhead
the reflection was still visible on the wall but now it was pale and peaceful like the reflection of a lamp or if a candle
the window was still open
this is what had taken place in m
madeleine's room
chapter iii a tempest in a skull the reader has no doubt already divined that m
madeleine is no other than jean valjean
we have already gazed into the depths of this conscience the moment has now come when we must take another look into it
we do so not without emotion and trepidation
there is nothing more terrible in existence than this sort of contemplation
the eye of the spirit can nowhere find more dazzling brilliance and more shadow than inhabit can fix itself on no other thing which is more formidable more complicated more mysterious and more infinite
there is a spectacle more grand than the sea it is heaven there is a spectacle more grand than heaven it is the inmost recesses of the soul
to make the poem of the human conscience were it only with reference to a single man were it only in connection with the bases for men would be to blend all epics into one superior and definitive epic
conscience is the chaos of chimeras of lists and of temptations the furnace of dreams the pair of ideas of which we are ashamed it is the pandemonium of sikhism's it is the battlefield of the passions
penetrate at certain hours past the livid face of a human being who is engaged in reflection and look behind gaze into that soul gaze into that obscurity
there beneath that external silence battles of giants like those recorded in homes are in progress skirmishes of dragons and hydra sand swarms of phantoms as in milton visionary circles as in dante
what a solemn thing is this infinity which every man bears within him and which he measures with despair against the captives of his brain and the actions of his life
alighieri one day met with a sinister looking door before which he hesitated
here is one before us upon whose threshold we hesitate
let us enter nevertheless
we have but little to add to what the reader already knows of what had happened to jean valjean after the adventure with little gervais
from that moment forth he was as we have seen a totally different man
what the bishop had wished to make of him that he carried out
it was more than a transformation it was a transfiguration
he succeeded in disappearing sold the bishop's silver reserving only the candlesticks as a souvenir crept from town to town traversed france cameron
shrm
conceived the idea which we have mentioned accomplished what we have related succeeded in rendering himself safe from seizure and inaccessible and thenceforth established atm
sign
happy in feeling his conscience saddened by the past and the first half of his existence belied by the last he lived in peace reassured and hopeful having henceforth only two though he to conceal his name and to sanctify his life to escape men and to return to god
these two thoughts were so closely intertwined in his mind that they formed but a single one there both were equally absorbing and imperative and ruled his slightest actions
in general they conspired to regulate the conduct of his life they turned him towards the gloom they rendered him kindly and simple they counselled him to the same things
sometimes however they conflicted
in that case as the reader will remember the man whom all the country of m
shrm
called m
madeleine did not hesitate to sacrifice the first to the second his security to his virtue
this in spite of all his reserve and all his prudence he had preserved the bishop's candlestick sworn mourning for him summoned and interrogated all the little savoyard's who passed that way collected in formation try adding the families at face rolled and saved old gauche le vent's life despite the disquieting insinuations of javert
it seemed as we have already remarked as though he thought following the example of all those who have been wise holy and just that his first duty was not towards himself
at the same time it must be confessed nothing just like this has yet presented itself
never had the two ideas which governed the unhappy man whose sufferings we are narrating engaged in so serious a struggle
he understood this confusedly but profoundly at the very first words pronounced by javert when the latter entered his study
at the moment when that name which he had buried beneath so many layers was so strangely articulated he was struck with stupor and as though intoxicated with the sinister eccentricity of his destiny and through this stupid he felt that shudder which precedes great shocks
he bent like an oak at the approach of a storm like a soldier at the approach of an assault
he felt shadows filled with thunders and lightning's descending upon his head
as he listened to kavery the first thought which occurred to him was to go to run and denounce himself to take that champ mathieu out of prison and place himself there this was as painful and we poignant as an incision in the living flesh
then it passed away and he said to himself we will see
we will see
here pressed this first generous instinct and recoiled before heroism
it would be beautiful no doubt after the bishop's holy words after so many years of repentance and an negation in the midst of a penitence admirably begin if this man had not flinched for an instant even in the presence of so terrible a conjecture but has continued to walk with the same step towards this yawning precipice at the bottom of which lay heaven that would have been beautiful but it was not thus
we must render an account of the things which went on in this soul and we can only tell what there was there
he was carried away at first by the instinct of self preservation he rallied all his ideas in has testified his emotions took into consideration javert's presence that great danger postponed all decision with the firmness of terror shook off thought as to what he had to do and resumed his calmness as a warrior picks up his buckler
he remained in this state during the rest of the day a whirlwind within a profound tranquillity without
he took no preservative measures as they may be called
everything was still confused and jostling together in his brain
his trouble was so great that he could not perceive the form of a single idea distinctly and he could have told nothing about himself except that he had received a great blow
he repaired for anyone's bed of suffering as usual and prolonged his visit through a kindly instinct telling himself that he must behave this and recommend her well to the sisters in case he should be obliged to be absent himself
he had a vague feeling that he might be obliged to go to areas and without having the least in the world made up his mind to this trip he said to himself that being as he was beyond the shadow of any suspicion there could be nothing out of the way in being a witness to what was to take place and he engaged the tilbury from a cake claire in order to be prepared in any event
he dined with a good deal of appetite
on returning to his room he communed with himself
he examined the situation and found it unprecedented so unprecedented that in the midst of his refer the rose from his chair moved by some inexplicable impulse of anxiety and bolted his door
he feared lest something more should enter
he was barri caring himself against possibilities
a moment later he extinguished hi slightly embarrassed him
it seemed to him as though he might be seen
by whom
alas
that on which he desired to close the door had already entered that which he desired to blind was staring him in the face his conscience
his conscience that is to say god
nevertheless be deluded himself at first he had a feeling of security and of solitude the bolt once drawn he thought himself impregnable the candle extinguished he felt himself invisible
then he took possession of himself he set his elbows on the table leaned his head on his hand and began to meditate in the dark
where do i stand
am not i dreaming
what have i heard
is it really true that i have seen that is vert and that he spoke to me in that manner
who can that champ mathieu be
so he resembles me
is it possible
when i reflect that yesterday i was so tranquil and so far from suspecting anything
what was i doing yesterday at this hour
what is there in this incident
what will the end be
what is to be done
this was the torment in which he found himself
his brain had lost its power of retaining ideas they passed like waves and he clutched his brow in both hands to arrest them
nothing but anguish extricated itself from this tumult which overwhelmed his will and his reason and from which he sought to draw proof and resolution
his head was burning
he went to the window and threw it wide open
there were no stars in the sky
he returned and seated himself at the table
the first hour passed in this manner
gradually however vague outlines began to take firm and to fix themselves in his meditation and he was able to catch a glimpse with precision of the reality not the whole situation but some of the details
he began by recognizing the fact that critical and extraordinary as was this situation he was completely master of it
this only caused an increase of his stupor
independently of the severe and religious aim which he has assigned to his actions all that he had made up to that day had been nothing but a hole in which to bury his name
that which he had always feared most of all in his homes of self communion during his sleepless nights was to ever hear that name pronounced he had said to himself that that would be the end of all things for him that on the day when that name made it's reappearance it would cause his new line to vanish from about him and who knows
perhaps even his new soul within him also
he shuddered at the very thought that this was possible
assuredly if anyone had said to him at such moments that the hour would come when that name would ring in his ears when the hideous words jean valjean would suddenly emerge from the darkness and rise in front of him when that formidable light capable of dissipating the mystery in which he had enveloped himself would suddenly blaze forth above his head and that that name would not he made him that that light would but produce an obscurity more sense that this tent veil would but increase the mystery that this earthquake would solidify his edifice that this prodigious incident would have no other result so far as he was concerned if so it seemed good to him than that of rendering his existence at once clearer and more impenetrable and that out of his confrontation with the phantom of jean valjean the good and worthy citizen monsieur madeleine would end the more honored more peaceful and more respected than ever if anyone had told him that he would have tossed his head and regarded the words as those of a madman
sell all this was precisely what had just come to pass all that accumulation of impossibilities was a face and god had permitted these wild fancies to become real things
his're very continued to grow clearer
became more and more to an understanding of his position
it seemed to him that he had but just wakes up from some inexplicable dream and that he found himself slipping down a declivity in the middle of the night erect shivering holding back all in vain on the very brink of the abyss
he distinctly perceived in the darkness a stranger am an unknown to him whom destiny had mistaken for him and whom she was thrusting into the gulf in his stead in order that the gulf might close once more it was necessary that someone himself or that other men should fall into it he had only let things take their course
the light became complete and he acknowledged this to himself that his place was empty in the valleys that do what he would it was still awaiting him that the theft from little gervais had led him back to it that this vacant place would await him and draw him on until he filled it that this was inevitable and fatal and then he said to himself that at this moment he had a substitute that it appeared that a certain champ mathieu had that ill luck and that as regards himself being present in the valleys in the person of that champ mathieu present in society under the name of m
madeleine he had nothing more to read provided that he did not prevent men from scaling over the head of that champ mathieu this stone of infamy which like the stone of the sepulchre falls once never to rise again
all this was so strange and so violent that there suddenly took place in him that indescribable movement which no man feels more than two or three times in the course of his life a sort of convulsion of the conscience which stirs up all that there is doubtful in the heart which is composed of irony of joy and of despair and which may be called an outburst of inward laughter
he hastily delighted his candle
well what then
he said to himself what am i afraid of
what is there in all that for me to think about
i am save all is over
i had but one partly open door through which my last night invade my life and behold that door is walked up forever
that is very who has been annoying me so long that terrible instinct which seemed to have divined me which had divined me good god
and which followed me everywhere that frightful hunting dog always making a point at me is thrown off the scent engaged elsewhere absolutely turned from the trail henceforth he is satisfied he will leave me in peace he has his jean valjean
who knows
it is even probable that he will wish to leave town
and all this has been brought about without any aid from me and i count for nothing in it
ah
but where is the misfortune in this
upon my honor people would think to see me that some catastrophe had happened to me
after all of it does bring harm to someone that is not my fault in the least it is providence which has done it all it is because it wishes it so to be evidently
have i. the right to die arrange what it has arranged
what do i ask now
why should i meddle
it does not concern me what
i am not satisfied but what more so i want
the goal to which i have aspired for so many years the dream of my nights the object of my prayers to heaven security i have now attained it is god who will sit i can do nothing against the will of god and why does god will it
in order that i may continue what i have begun that i may do good that i may one day be a grand and encouraging example that it may be said at last that a little happiness has been attached to the penance which i have undergone and to that virtue to which i have returned
really i do not understand why i was afraid a little while ago to enter the house of that good core and to ask his advice this is evidently what he would have said to me it is settled let things take their course let the good god do as he likes
thus did he address himself in the depths of his own conscience bending over what may be called his own abyss he rose from his chair and began to pave the room come said he let us think no more about it my resolve is taken
but he felt no joy
quite the reverse
one can no more prevent thought from recurring to an idea than one can the sea from returning to the shore the sailor calls it the ride the guilty man calls it remorse for up heaves the soul as he does the ocean
after the expiration of a few moments do what he would be resumed the gloomy dialogue in which it was he who spoke and he who listened saying that which he would have preferred to ignore and listened to that which he would have preferred not to hear yielding to that mysterious power which said to him think
as it said to another condemned man two thousand years ago march on
before proceeding further and in order to make ourselves fully understood let us insist upon one necessary observation
it is certain that people do talk to themselves there is no living being who has not done it
it may even be said that the word is never a more magnificent mystery than when it goes from thought to conscience within a man and when it returns from conscience no thought it is in this sense only that the words so often employed in this chap her he said he exclaimed must be understood one speaks to one's self talks to one's self exclaims to one's self without breaking the external silence there is a great tumult everything about us talks except the mouth
the realities of the soul are nonetheless realities because they are not visible and palpable
so he asked himself where he stood
he interrogated himself upon that settled resolve
he confessed to himself that all that he had just arranged in his mind was monstrous that to let things take their course to let the good god do as he liked was simply horrible to allow this error of fate and of men to be carried out not to hinder it to lend himself to it through his silence to do nothing in short was to do everything
that this was hypocritical baseness in the last degree
that it was a base cowardly sneaking abject hideous crime
for the first time in eight years the wretched man had just tasted the bitter savor of an evil thought and of an evil action
he spit it out with disgust
he continued to question himself
he asked himself severely what he had meant by this my object is attained
he declared to himself that his life really had an object but what object
to conceal his name
to receive the police
was it for so petty a thing that he had done all that he had done
had he got another and a grand object which was the true one to save no this person but his soul to become honest and good once more to be a just man
was it not that above all that alone which he had always desired which the bishop had enjoined upon him to shut the door on his past
but he was not shutting it
great god
he was reopening it by committing an infamous action
he was becoming a thief once more and the most odious of thieves
he was robbing a mother of his existence his life his peace his place in the sunshine
he was becoming an assassin
he was murdering morally murdering a wretched man
he was inflicting on him that frightful living death that death beneath the open sky which is called the galleys
on the other hand to surrender himself to save that man struck down with so melancholy an error to resume his own name to become once more out of duty the convict jean valjean that was in truth to achieve his resurrection and to close forever that he'll whence he had just emerged to fall back there in appearance was to escape from it in reality
this must be done
he had done nothing if he did not do all this his whole life was useless all his penitence was wasted
there was no longer any need of saying what is the use
he felt that the bishop was there that the bishop was present all the more because he was dead that the bishop was gazing fixedly at him that henceforth mayor madeleine with all his virtues would be abominable to him and that the convict jean valjean would be pure and admirable in his sight that men beheld his mask but that the bishop saw his face that men saw his life but that the bishop be held his conscience
so he must go to arg as deliver the false jean valjean and denounce the realone
alas
that was the greatest of sacrifices the most poignant of victories the last step to take but it must be done
sad fate
he would enter into sanctity only in the eyes of god when he returned to infamy in the eyes of men
well said he let us decide upon this let us do our duty let us save this man
he uttered these words aloud without perceiving that he was speaking aloud
he took his books verified them and put them in order
he flung in the fire a bundle of bills which he had against petty and embarrassed tradesmen
he wrote and sealed a letter and on the envelope it might have been ready as there been anyone in his chamber at the moment to monsieur laffitte banker rued' artois paris
he drew from his secretary a pocket book which contained several banknotes and the passport of which he had made use that same year when he went to the elections
anyone who had seen him during the execution of these various acts into which there entered such grave thought would have had no suspicion of what was going on within him
only occasionally did his lips move at other times he raised his head and fired his gaze upon some point of the wall as though there existed at that point something which he wished to elucidate or interrogate
when he had finished the letter to m
laffitte he put it into his pocket together with the pocketbook and began his walk once more
his're very had not swerved from its course
he continued to see his duty clearly written in luminous letters which flamed before his eyes and changed its place as he altered the direction of his glance go
tell your name
denounce yourself
in the same way he beheld as though they had passed before him invisible forms the two ideas which had up to that time formed the double rule of his soul the concealment of his name the sanctification of his life
for the first time they appeared to him as absolutely distinct and he perceived the distance which separates them
he recognized the fact that one of these ideas was necessarily good while the other might become bad that the first was self devotion and that the other was personality that the one said my neighbor and that the other said myself that one emanated from the light and the other from darkness
they were antagonistic
he saw them in conflict
in proportion as he hesitated they grew before the eyes of his spirit
they had now attained colossal statutes and it seemed to him that he be held within himself in that infinity of which we were recently speaking in the midst of the darkness and the light da goddess and a giant contending
he was filled with terror but it seemed to him that the good thought was getting the upper hand
he felt that he was on the brink of the second decisive crisis of his conscience and of his destiny that the bishop had marked the first phase of his new life and that champ mathieu marked the second
after the grand crisis the grand test
but the federal layer for an instant gradually resumed possession of him
a thousand thoughts traversed his mind but they continues to fortify him in his resolution
one moment he said to himself that he was perhaps taking the matter too keenly that after all this champ mathieu was not interesting and that he has actually been guilty of theft
he answered himself if this man has indeed stolen a few apples that means a month in prison
it is a long way from that to the galleys
and who knows
did he steal
has it been proved
the name of jean valjean overwhelms him and seems to dispense with proofs
do not the attorneys for the crown always proceed in this manner
he is supposed to be a thief because he is known to be a convict
in another instant the thought had occurred to him that when he denounced himself the heroism of his deed might perhaps be taken into consideration and his honest life for the last seven years and what he had done for the district and that they would have mercy on him
but this supposition vanished very quickly and he smiled bitterly as he remembered that the theft of the forth sous from little gervais put him in the position of a man guilty of a second offence after conviction that this affair would certainly come up and according to the precise terms of the law would render him liable to penal servitude for life
he burn cd aside from all illusions detached himself more and more from earth and sought strength and consolation elsewhere
he told himself that he must do his duty that perhaps he should not be more unhappy after doing his duty than after having avoided it that if he allowed things to take their own course if he remained at m
shrm
his consideration his good name his good works the deference and veneration paid to him his charity his wealth his popularity his virtue would be seasoned with a crime
and what would be the taste of all these holy things when bound up with this hideous thing
while if he accomplished his sacrifice a celestial idea would be mingled with the galleys the post their oh necklet the green cap unceasing toil and pitiless shame
at length he told himself that it must be so that his destiny was thus allotted that he had not authority to alter the arrangements made in high that in any case he must make his choice virtue without and abomination within or holiness within and infamy without
the stirring up of these lugubrious ideas did not cause his courage to fail but his brain grow weary
he began to think of other things of in different matters in spite of himself
the veins in his temples throbbed violently he still paced to and fro midnight sounded first from the parish church then from the town hall be counted the twelve strokes of the two clocks and compared the sounds of the two bell she recalled in this connection the fact that a few days previously he had seen in an ironmonger's shop an ancient click for sale upon which was written the name antoine album de roma in ville
he was cold he lighted a small fire it did not occur to him to close the window
in the meantime he had relapsed into his stupid he was obliged to make a tolerably vigorous effort to recall what had been the subject of his thoughts before midnight had struck he finally succeeded in doing this
ah
yes he said to himself i had resolved to inform against myself
and the mall of a sudden he thought of bantine
hold
said he and what about that poor woman
here a fresh crisis declared itself
can find by appearing this abruptly in his're very produced the effect of an unexpected day of light it seemed to him as though everything about him were undergoing a change of aspect he exclaimed am
but i have hitherto considered no one but myself it is proper for me to hold my tongue or to denounce myself to conceal my person or to save my soul to be a despicable and respected magistrate or an infamous and venerable convict it is kit is always land nothing but i but good god
all this is egotism there are diverse forms of egotism but it is egotism all the same
what if i were to think a little about others
the highest holiness is to think of others come let us examine the matter
the i excepted their traced the i forgotten what would be the result of all this
what if i denounce myself
i am arrested this champ mathieu is released i am put back in the valleys that is well and what then
what is going on here
ah
here is a country shown here are factories an industry workers both men and women aged grandsires children poor people
all this i have created all these i provide with their living everywhere where there is a smoking chimney if i wish i have placed the brandon the hearth and meat in the pot i have created ease circulation credit before me there was nothing i have elevated vivi died informed with life tech heated stimulated enriched the whole countryside lacking me the soul is lacking i take myself off everything dies and this woman who has suffered so much who possesses so many merits in spite of her call the cause of all whose misery i have unwittingly been
and that child whom i meant to join search of whom i have promised to her mother doin it also owe something to this woman in reparation for the evil which i have done her
if i disappear what happens
the mother does the child becomes what it can that is what will take place if i denounce myself
if i do not denounce myself
come let us see how it will be if i do not denounce myself
after putting this question to himself he paused he seemed to undergo a momentary hesitation and trepidation but it did not last long and he answered himself calmly well this man is going to the galleys it is true but what the deuce
he has stolen
there is no use in my saying that he has not been guilty of theft for he has
i remain here i go on in ten years i shall have made ten million si scatter them over the country i have nothing of my own what is that time
it is not for myself that i am doing it the prosperity of all goes on augmenting industries are aroused and animated factories and shops are multiplied families a hundred families a thousand families are happy the district becomes populated villages spring up where there were only farms before farm arise where there was nothing wretched ness disappears and with wretchedness debauchery prostitution theft murder all vices disappear all crimes and thus poor mother reads her child and behold a whole country rich and honest
ah
i was a fool
i was absurd
what was that i was saying about denouncing myself
i really must pay attention and not be precip it dts about anything
what
because it would have pleased me to play the grand and generous this is melodrama after all because i should have thought of no one but myself the idea
for the sake of saving from a punishment a trifle exaggerated perhaps but just at bottom no one knows whom a thief a good for nothing evidently a whole countryside must perish
a poor woman must die in the hospital
a poor little girl must die in the street
like dogs at this is abominable
and without the mother even having seen her child once more almost without the child's having known her mother and all that for the sake of an old wretch of an apple thief who most assuredly has deserved the galleys for something else if not for that fine scruples indeed which saves guilty man and sacrifice the innocent which save an old vagabond who has only a few years to live at most and who will not be more unhappy in the galleys than in his novel and which sacrifice a whole population mother's wives children
this poor little cosette who has no one in the world but he and who is no doubt blue with cold at this moment in the den of those the barriers those peoples are rascals and i was going to neglect my duty towards all these poor creatures and i was going off to denounce myself and i was about to commit that unspeakable folly
let us put it at the worst suppose that there is a wrong action on my part in this and that my conscience will reproach me for it someday to accept for the good of others these reproaches which weigh only on myself this evil action which compromises my soul alone in that lies self sacrifice in that alone there is virtue
he rose and resumed his march this time he seemed to be content
diamonds are found only in the dark places of the earth truths are found only in the depths of thought
it seemed to him that after having descended into these depths after having long helped among the darkest of these shadows he had at last found one of these diamonds one of these truths and that he now held it in his hand and he was dazzled as he gazed upon it
yes he thought this is right i am on the right road i have the solution i must end by holding fast to something my resolve is taken let things take their course let us no longer vacillate let us no longer hang back this is for the interest of a limit for my own i am madeleine and madeleinel' remain
woe to the man who is jean valjean
i am no longer be i do not know that man i no longer know anything it turns out that someone is jean valjean at the present moment let him lookout for himself that does not concern me it is a fatal game which was floating abroad in the night i got halts and descends on ahead so much the worse for that head
he looked into the little mirror which hung above his chimney piece and said hold
it has relieved me to come to a decision i am quite another man now
he proceeded a few paces further then he stopped short
come
he said i must not flinch before any of the con sequences of the resolution which i have once adopted there are still threads which attach me to that jean valjean they must be broken in this very room there are objects which would betray me dumb things which would bear witness against me it is settled all these things just disappear
he fumbled in his pocket drew out his purse opened it and took out a small key be inserted the key in a lock whose aperture could hardly be seen so hidden was it in the most sombre tones of the design which covered the wallpaper a secret receptacle opened a sort of false cupboard constructed in the angle between the wall and the chimney piece in this hiding place there were some days a blue linen blouse an old pair of trousers an old knapsack and a huge thorn cudgel show with iron at both ends
those who had seen jean valjean at the epoch when he passed through big october could easily have recognized all the pieces of this miserable outfit
he had preserved then as he had preserved the silver candlesticks in order to remind himself continually of his starting point but he had concealed all that came from the valleys and he had allowed the candlesticks which came from the bishop to be seen
he cast a furtive glance towards the door as though he feared that it would open in spite of the bolt which fastened of them with a quick and abrupt movement he took the whole in his arms at once without bestowing so much as a glance on the things which he had so religiously and so perilously preserved for so many years and flung them all tags cudgel knapsack into the fire
illustration candlesticks into the foren into the fire be closed the false cupboard again and with redoubled precautions henceforth unnecessary since it was now empt the concealed the door behind a heavy piece of furniture which he pushed in front of it
after the lapse of a few seconds the room and the opposite wall were lighted up with a fierce red tremulous glow
everything was on fire the thorn cudgel snapped and threw out sparks to the middle of the chamber
as the knapsack was consumed together with the hideous tags which it contained it revealed something which sparkled in the ashes
by bending over one could have readily recognized as pin no doubt the forty so i piece stolen from the little savoyard
he did not look at the fire but paced back and forth with the same step
all at once his eye fell on the two silver candlesticks which shone vaguely on the chimney piece through the glow
hold
he thought the whole of jean valjean is still in them
f jay must be destroyed also
he seized the two candlesticks
there was still fire enough to allow of their being put out of shape and converted into a sort of unrecognizable bar of metal
he bent over the hearth and warmed himself for a moment
he felt a sense of real comfort
how good warm this
said he
he stirred the live coals with one of the candlesticks
a minute more and they were both in the fire
at that moment it seemed to him that he heard a voice within him shouting jean valjean
jean valjean
his hair rose upright he became like a man who is listening to some terrible thing
yes that's it
finish
said the voice
complete what you are about
destroy these candlesticks
annihilate this souvenir
forget the bishop
forget everything
destroy this champ mathieu do
that is right
applaud yourself
so it is settled resolved fixed agreed here is an old man who does not know what is wanted if him who has perhaps done nothing an innocent man whose whole misfortune lies in your name upon whom your name weighs like a crime who is about to be taken for you who will be condemned who will finish his days in abject news and horror
that is good
be an honest man yourself remain monsieur lemaire remain honorable and honored enrich the town nourish the indigent read the orphan live happy virtuous and admired and during this time while you are here in the midst of joy and light there will be a man who will wear your red blouse who will hear your name in ignominy and who will drag your chain in the galleys
yes it is well arranged this
at wretch
the perspiration streamed from his brow
he fixed a haggard eye on the candlesticks
but that within him which has spoken had not finished
the voice continued jean valjean there will be around you many voices which will make a great noise which will talk very loud and which will bless you and only one which no one will hear and which will curse you in the dark
well
listen infamous man
all those benedictions will fall back before they reach heaven and only the male fiction will ascend to god
this voice feeble at first and which had proceeded from the most obscure depths of his conscience had gradually become startling and formidable and he now heard it in his very far
it seemed to him that it had detached itself from him and that it was now speaking outside of him
he thought that he heard the last words so distinctly that he glanced around the room in a sort of terror
is there anyone here
he demanded a loud in utter bewilderment
then he resumed with a laugh which resembled that of an idiot how stupid i am
there can be no one
there was someone but the person who was there was of those whom the human eye can not see
he placed the candlesticks on the chimney piece
then he resumed his monotonous and lugubrious tramp which troubled the dreams of the sleeping man beneath him and a woke him with a start
this tramping to and fro soothed and at the same time intoxicated him
it sometimes seems on supreme occasions as though people moved about for the purpose of asking advice of everything that they may encounter by change in place
after the lapse of a few minutes he no longer knew his position
he now recoiled in equal terror before both the resolutions at which he had arrived in turn
the two ideas which counselled him appeared to him equally fatal
what a fatality
what conjunction that that champ mathieu should us ve been taken for him to be overwhelmed by precisely the means which providence seemed to have employed at first to strengthen his position
there was a moment when he reflected on the future
denounce himself great god
deliver himself up
with immense despair he faced all that he should be obliged to leave all that he should be obliged to take up once more
he should have to bid farewell to that existence which was so good copy desk radiant to the respect of all to honor to liberty
he should never more stroll in the field she should never more hear the birds sing in the month or maybe should never more bestowal me on the little children he should never more experience the sweetness of having glances of gratitude and love fixed upon him he should quit that house which he had built that little chamber
everything seemed charming to him at that moment
never again should be read those books nevermore should he wrote on that little table of whitewood his old port read the only servant whom he kept would never more bring him his coffee in the morning
great god
instead of that the convict gang the iron necklet the red waistcoat the chain on his ankle fatigue the cell the camp bed all those horrors which he knew sowell
at his age after having been what he was
if he were only young again
but to be addressed in his old age as though anyone who pleased to be searched by the convict guard to receive the valley sergeant's cudgel longs to wear ironbound shoes on his bare feet to have to stretch out his leg night and morning to the hammer of the rounds man who visits the gang to submit to the curiosity of strangers who would be told that many onder is the famous jean valjean who was mayor of m
shrm
and at night dripping with perspiration overwhelmed with lassitude their green caps drawn over their eyes to remount two by two the ladder staircase of the galleys beneath the sergeant's whip
oh what misery
can destiny then be as malicious as an intelligent being and become as monstrous as the human heart
and do what he would he always fell back upon the heartrending dilemma which lay at the foundation of his're very should be remain in paradise and become a demon
should be return to hell and become an angel
what was to be done
great god
what was to be done
the torment from which he had escaped with so much difficulty was inch ahmed a fresh within him
his ideas began to grow confused once more they assumed a kind of stupefied and mechanical quality which is peculiar to despair
the name of domain ville recurred incessantly to his mind with the two verses of a song which he had heard in the past
he thought that domain ville was a little grove near paris where young lovers go to pluck lilacs in the month of april
he wavered outwardly as well as inwardly
he walked like a little child who is permitted to toddle alone
at intervals as he combated his lassitude he made an effort to recover the mastery of his mind
he tried to put to himself for the last time and definitely the problem over which he had in a manner fallen prostrate with fatigue ought me to denounce himself
ought me to hold his peace
he could not manage to see anything distinctly
the vague aspects of all the courses of reasoning which had been sketched out by his meditations quivered and vanished one after the other into a joke
he only felt that go whatever course of action he made up his mind something in him must die and that of necessity and without his being able to escape the fact that he was entering a sepulchre on the right hand as much as on the left that he was passing through a death agony the agony of his happiness of the agony of his virtue
alas
all his resolution had again taken possession of him
he was no further advances than at the beginning
thus did this unhappy soul struggle in its anguish
eighteen hundred years before this unfortunate man the mysterious being in whom are summed up all the sanctified and all the sufferings of humanity has also long thrust aside with his hand while the olive trees quivered in the woodwind of the infinite the terrible cup which appeared to him dripping with darkness and overflowing with shadows in the depths all studded with state
chapter iv forms assumed by suffering during sleep threeo'clock in the morning had just struck and he had been walking thus for five hours almost uninterruptedly when heat lab ghg allowed himself to drop into his chair
there he fell asleep and had a dream
this dream like the majority of dreams bore no relation to the situation except by its painful and heartrending cnw faster but it made an impression on him
this nightmare struck him so forcibly that he wrote it down later on
it is one of the papers in his own handwriting which he has bequeathed to us
we think that we have here reproduced the thing in strict accordance with the text
of whatever nature this dream may be the history of this night would be incomplete if we were took it if it is the gloomy adventure of an ailing soul
here it is
on the envelope we find this line inscribed the dream i had that night
i was in a plain a vast gloomy plain where there was no grass
it did not seem to me to be daylight not yet night
i was walking with my brother the brother of my childish years the brother of whom i must say i never think and whom i now hardly remember
we were conversing and we met some passersby
we were talking of a neighbor of our sin former days who had always worked with her window open from the time when she came to live on the street
as we talked we felt cold because of that open window
there were no trees in the plain
we saw a man passing close to us
he was entirely nude of the hue of ashes and mounted on a horse which was earth color
the man had no fair we could see his skull and the veins on it
in his hand he held a switch which was as supple as a fine shoot and as heavy as iron
this horseman passed and said nothing to us
my brother said home' let us take to the hollow road
' there existed a hollow way wherein one was neither a single shrub not a spear of moss
everything was diet colored even the sky
after proceeding a few paces i received no reply when i spoke i perceived that my brother was no longer with me
i entered a village which is spied
i reflected that it must be romain ville
why domain ville
the first street that i entered was deserted
i entered a second street
behind the angle formed by the two streets a man was standing erect against the wall
i said to this man' what country is this
whereami
' the man made no reply
i saw the door of a house open and i entered
the first chamber was deserted
i entered the second
behind the door of this chamber a man was standing erect against the wall
i inquired of this man' whose house is this
whereami
' the man replied not
the house had a garden
i quitted the house and entered the garden
the garden was deserted
behind the first tree i found a man standing upright
i said to this man' what garden is this
whereami
' the man did not answer
i strolled into the village and perceived that it was a town
all the streets were deserted all the doors were open
not a single living being was passing in the streets walking through the chambers or strolling in the gardens
but behind each angle of the walls behind each door behind each trees goods silent man
only one was to be seen at a time
these men watched me pass
i left the town and began to ramble about the fields
after the lapse of some time i turned back and saw a great crowd coming up behind me
i recognized all the men whom i had seen in that town
they had strange heads
they did not seem to be in a hurry yet they walked faster than i did
they made no noise as they walked
in a big stand this crowd had overtaken and surrounded me
the faces of these men were earthen in the
then the first one whom i had seen and questioned on entering the town said to me' whither are you going
do you not know that you have been read this long time
' i opened my mouth to reply and i perceived that there was no one near me
he woke
he was icy cold
a wind which was still like the breeze of dawn was battling the leaves of the window which had been left open on their hinges
the fire was out
the candle was nearing its end
it was still blacknight
he rose he went to the window
there were no stars in the sky even yet
from his window they are of the house and the street were visible
a sharp harsh noise which made him drop his eyes resounded from the earth
below him he perceived two red stars whose days lengthened and shortened in a singular manner through the darkness
as his thoughts were still half immersed in the mists of sleep hold
said he there are no stars in the sky
they are on earth now
but this confusion vanished a second sound similar to the first roused him thoroughly he looked and recognized the fact that these two stars were the lanterns of a carriage
by the light which they cast he was able to distinguish the form of this vehicle
it was a tilbury harnessed to a small white horse
then lose which he had heard was the trampling of the horse's homes on the pavement
what vehicle is this
he said to himself
who is coming here so early in the morning
at that moment there came a light tap on the door of his chamber
he shuddered from head to foot and cried in a terrible voice who is there
someone said i monsieur lemaire
he recognized the voice of the old woman who was his port read
well
he replied what is it
monsieur le maine it is just fiveo'clock in the morning
what is that time
the cabriolet is here monsieur lemaire
what cabriolet
the tilbury
what tilbury
did not monsieur lemaire orders tilbury
no. said he
the coachman says that he has come for monsieur lemaire
what coachman
m
's day f claire's coachman
m
as aug claire
that name sent a shudder over him as though a flash of lightning had passed in front of his face
ah
yes he resumed m
's sake claire
if the old woman could have seen him at that moment she would have been frightened
a tolerably long silence ensued
he examined the flame of the candle with a stupid air and from around the sick he took some of the burning wax which he rolled between his fingers
the old woman waited for him
she even ventured to uplift her voice once more what amigos at monsieur lemaire
say that it is well and that i am coming down
chapter v hindrances the posting service from areas tom
sign
was still operated at this period by snail mail wagons of the time of the empire
these mail wagons were two wheeled cabriolet's upholstered inside with fawn colored leather hung on springs and having hit two seats one for the post boy the other for the traveller
the wheels were armed with those long offensive asked which keep other vehicles at a distance and which may still be seen on the road in germany
the despatch box an immense oblong coffee was placed behind the vehicle and formed a part of it
this coffee was painted black and the cabriolet yellow
these vehicles which have no counterparts nowadays had something distorted and hunchback ed about them and when one saw them passing in the distance and climbing up some road to the horizon they resembled the insects which are called i think termites and which though with but little force let drag a great train behind them
but they travelled at a very rapid rate
the postwar on which set out from areas at oneo'clock every night after the mail from paris had passed arrived at m
shrm
a little before fiveo'clock in the morning
that night the wagon which was descending tom
shrm
by the head in road collided at the corner of a street just as it was entering the town with a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse which was going in the opposite direction and in which there was but one person a man enveloped in a mantle
the wheel of the tilbury received quite a violent stock
the postman shouted to the man to stop but the traveller land no need and pursue this road at full gallop
that man is in a devilish hurry
said the postman
the man thus hastening on was the one whom we have just seen struggling in convulsions which are certainly deserving of pity
whither waste going
he could not have told
why waste hastening
he did not know
he was driving at random straight ahead
whither
to areas no doubt but he might have been going elsewhere as well
at times he was conscious of it and he shuddered
he plunged into the night as into a gulf
something urged him forward something drew him on
no one could have told what was taking place within him everyone will understand it
what man is there who has not entered at least once in his life into that obscure cavern of the unknown
however he had resolved on nothing decided nothing formed no plan done nothing
none of the actions of his conscience had been decisive
he was more than ever as he had been at the first moment
why waste going to areas
he repeated what he had already said to himself when he had hired as aug claire's cabriolet that whatever the result was to be there was no reason why he should not see with his own eyes and judge of matters for himself that this was even prudent that he must know what took place that no decision would be arrived at without having observed and scrutinized that one made mountains out of everything from a distance that at any rate when he should have seen that champ mathieu some wretch his conscience would probably be greatly relieved to allow him to go to the valleys in his stead that is very would indeed be there and that brevet that chen il dish that coche pail of old convicts who had known him but they certainly would not recognize him bag
what an idea
that is very was a hundred leagues from suspecting the truth that all conjectures and all suppositions were fixed on champ mathieu and that there is nothing so headstrong as suppositions and conjectures that accordingly there was no danger
that it was no doubt a warm moment but that he should emerge from it that after all he held his destiny however bad it might be in his own hand that he was master of it
he clung to this thought
at bottom to tell the whole truth he would have preferred not to go to areas
nevertheless he was going thither
as he meditated he whipped up his horse which was proceeding at that fine regular and event for which accomplishes two leagues and a half an hour
in proportion as the cabriolet advanced he felt something within him draw back
at daybreak he was in the open country the town of m
shrm
pay far behind him
he watched the horizon grow white he stared at all the chilly figures of a winter's raw gas they passed before his eyes but without seeing them
the morning has its spectres as well as the evening
he did not see them but without his being aware of it and by means of a sort of penetration which was almost physical these black silhouettes of trees and of hills added some gloomy and sinister quality to the violent state of his soul
each time that he passed one of those isolated dwellings which sometimes border on the highway he said to himself and yet there are people there within who are sleeping
the trot of the horse the bells on the harness the wheels on the road produced a gentle monotonous boise
these things are charming when one is joyous and lugubrious when one is sad
it was broad daylight when he arrived at head in
be halted in front of the inn to allow the horses breathing spell and to have him given some oats
the horse belonged ass said claire had said to that small race of the foul on nais which has too much head too much belly and not enough neck and shoulders but which has a broad chest a large c. ruppert him fine legs and solid holds a homely but a robust and healthy race
the excellent beast had travelled five leagues in two hours and had not a drop of sweat on his loins
he did not get out of the tilbury
the stable man who brought the late suddenly bent down and examined the left wheel
are you going far in this condition
said the man
he replied with an air of not having roused himself from his're very why
have you come from a great distance
went on the man
five leagues
ah
why do you say' ah
' the man bent down once more was silent for a moment with his eyes fixed on the wheel then he does erect and said because though this wheel has traveller five leagues it certainly will not travel another quarter of a prague
he sprang out of the tilbury
what is that you say my friend
i say that it is a miracle that you should have travelled five leagues without you and your horse rolling into some ditch on the highway
just see here
the wheel really had suffered serious damage
the shock administered by the mail wagon had split two spokes and strained the hub so that the nut no longer held firm
my friend he said to the stable man is there a wheelwright here
certainly air
come the service to go and fetch him
he is only a step from here
hey
master four gaillard
master four gaillard the wheelwright was standing on his own threshold
he came examined the wheel and made a grimace like a surgeon when the latter thinks climb is broken
can you repair this wheel immediately
yes sir
when can i set out again
tomorrow
tomorrow
there is a long day's work on it
are you in a hurry sur
in a very great hurry
i must set out again in an hour at the latest
impossible air
i will pay whatever you ask
impossible
well in two hours then
impossible today
haines spokes and a hub must be made
monsieur will not be able to start before tomorrow morning
the matter can not wait until tomorrow
what if you were to replace this wheel instead of repairing it
how do
you are a wheelwright
certainly air
have you not a wheel that you can sell me
then i could start again at once
a spare wheel
yes
i have no wheeling and that would fit your cabriolet
two wheels make a pair
two wheels can not be put together haphazard
in that case sell me a pair of wheels
not all wheels for all sales air
try nevertheless
it is useless for
i have nothing to sell but cartwheels
we are but a poor country here
have you a cabriolet that you can let me have
the wheelwright had seen at the first glance that the tilbury was a hired vehicle
he shrugged his shoulders
you treat the cabriolet's that people let you sowell
jbl marine i would not let it to you
we'll sell it to me then
i have none
what
not even a spring cart
i am not hard to please as houses
we live in a poor country
there is in truth added the wheelwright an old ca last under the shed yonder which belongs to a bourgeois of the town who gave it to me to take care of and who only uses it on the thirty sixth of the month never that is to say
i might let that to you for what matters it home
but the bourgeois must not see it pass and then it is a cala shit would require two horses
i will take two post horses
where is monsieur doing
to areas
and monsieur wishes to reach there today
yes of course
by taking two post horses
why not
does it make any difference whether monsieur arrives at fouro'clock tomorrow moen int
certainly not
there is one thing to be said about that you see by taking post horses monsieur has his passport
yes
well by taking post horses monsieur can not reach areas before tomorrow
we are on a cross road
the relays are badly served the horses are in the fields
the season for ploughing is just beginning heavy teams are required and horses are seized upon everywhere from the post as well as elsewhere
monsieur will have to wait three or four hours at the least at every relay
and then they drive at a wall
there are many hills to ascend
dome then i will go on horseback
in harness the cabriolet
someone can surely sell me a saddle in the neighborhood
without doubt
but will this horse bear the saddle
that is true you remind me of that he will not nearly
then but i can surely hire a horse in the village
a horse to travel to areas at one stretch
yes
that would require such a horse as does not exist in these parts
you would have to buy it to begin with because no one knows you
but you will not find one for sale nor to let for five hundred francs or for a thousand
what am i todo
the best thing is to let me repair the wheel like an honest man and set out on your journey tomorrow
tomorrow will be too late
the deuce
is there not a mail wagon which runs to areas
when will it pass
tonight
both the posts pass at night the one going as well as the one coming
what
it will take you a day to mend this wheel
a day and a good long one
if you set two men to work
if i set ten men to work
what if the spikes were to be tied together with ropes
that could be done with the spokes not with the hub and the belly is in a bad state top
is there anyone in this village who lets out teams
no
is there another wheelwright
the stable man and the wheelwright replied in concert with a toss of the head
no
he felt an immense joy
it was evident that providence was intervening
that it was it who had broken the wheel of the tilbury and who was stopping him on the road
he had not yielded to this sort of first summons he had just made every possible effort to continue the journey he had loyally and scrupulously exhausted all means he had been deterred neither by the season not fatigue nor by the expense he had nothing with which to reproach himself
if he went no further that was no fault of his
it did not concern him further
it was no longer his fault
it was not the act of his own conscience but the act of providence
he breathed again
he breathed freely and to the full extent of his lungs for the first time since i avery's visit
it seemed to him that the hand of iron which had held his heart in its grasp for the last twenty hours had just released him
it seemed to him that god was for him now and was manifesting himself
he said himself that he had done all he could and that now he had nothing to do but we trace his steps quietly
if his conversation with the wheelwright had taken place in a chamber of the inn it would have had no witnesses no one would have heard him things would have rested there and it is probable that we should not have had to relate any of the occurrences which the reader is about to peruse but this conversation had taken place in the street
any colloquy in the street inevitably attracts a crowd
there are always people who ask nothing better than to become spectators
while he was questioning the wheelwright some people who were passing back and forth halted around them
after listening for a few minutes a young lad to whom no one had paid any need detached himself from the group and ran off
at the moment when the traveller after the inward deliberation which we have just described resolved to retrace his steps this child returned
he was accompanied by an old woman
monsieur said the woman jun it tells me that you wish to hire a cabriolet
these simple words uttered by an old woman led by a child made the perspiration trickle down his limbs
he thought that he beheld the hand which had relaxed its grasp reappear in the darkness behind him ready to seize him once more
he answered yes my good woman i am in search pda cabriolet which i can hire
and he hastened to add but there is none of the place
certainly there is said the old woman
where
interpolated the wheelwright
at my house replied the old woman
he shuddered
the fatal hand had grasped him again
the old woman really had in her shed a sort of basket spring cart
the wheelwright and the stable man in despair at the prospect of the traveller escaping their clutches interfered
it was a frightful old trap it rests flat on the axle it is an actual fact that the seats were suspended inside it by leather thongs the rain came into it the wheels were rushed and eaten with moisture it would not go much further than the tilbury a regular ramshackle old stage wagon the gentleman would make a great mistake if he trusted himself to it etc
etc.
all this was true but this trap this ramshackle old vehicle this thing whatever it was ran on its two wheels and could go to areas
he paid what was asked left the tilbury with the wheelwright to be repaired intending to reclaim it on his return had the white horse put to the cart climbed into it and resumed the road which he had been travelling since morning
at the moment when the cart moved off he admitted that he had felt a moment previously a certain joy in the thought that he should not go whither he was now proceeding
he examined this joy with a sort of wrath and found it absurd
why should be feel joy at turning back
after all he was taking this trip of his own free will
no one was forcing him tour
and assuredly nothing would happen except what he should choose
as he left head in. he heard a voice shouting to him stop
shop
he halted the cart with a vigorous movement which contained a feverish and convulsive element resembling hope
it was the old woman's little boy
monsieur said the latter it was i who got the cart for you
well
you have not given me anything
he who have to all so readily thought this demand exorbitant and almost odious
ah
it's you you scamp
said he you shall have nothing
he whipped up his horse and set off at full speed
he had lost a great deal of time at head in
he wanted to make it good
the little horse was courageous and pulled for two but it was the month of february there had been gain the roads were bad
and then it was no longer the tilbury
the cart was very heavy and in addition there were many accents
he took nearly four hours to go from head into saint pop four hours for five leagues
at saint pol he had the horsd' un harnessed at the first inn he came to and led to the stable as he had promised a cake claire he stood beside the manner while the horse was eating he thought of sad and confusing things
the innkeeper's wife came to the stable
does not monsieur wish to breakfast
come that is true i even have a good appetite
he followed the woman who had a rosy cheerful face she led him to the public room where there were tables covered with waxed cloth
make haste
said he i must start again i am in a hurry
a big flemish servant maid placed his knife and fork in all haste he looked at the girl with a sensation of comfort
that is what aileen she thought i had not breakfasted
his breakfast was served he seized the bread took a mouthful and then slowly replaced it on the table and did not touch it again
a. carter was eating at another table he said to this man why is their bread so bitter here
the carter was a german and did not understand him
he returned to the stable and remained near the horse
an hour later he had quitted saint poland was directing his course towards him ques which is only five leagues from areas
what did he do during this journey
of what was he thinking
as on the morning he watched the trees the thatched roofs the filled fields pass by and the way in which the landscape broken at every turn of the road vanished this is a sort of contemplation which sometimes suffices to the soul and almost relieves it from thought
what is more melancholy and more profound than to see a thousand objects for the first and the last time
to travel is to be born and to die at every instant perhaps in the vaguest region of his mind he did make comparisons between the shifting horizon and our human existence all the things of life are perpetually fleeing before is the dark and bright intervals are intermingled after a dazzling moment an eclipse we look we hastened stretch out our hands to grasp what is passing each event is a turn in the road and all at once we are old we feel a shock all is black we distinguish an obscure door the gloomy horse of life which has been drawing us halts and we see a veiled and unknown per robin harnessing amid the shadows
twilight was failing when the children who were coming out of school be held this traveller entert in ques it is true that the days were still short he did not halt at tin que as she emerged from the village a laborer who was mending the road with stones raised his head and said to him that horse is very much fatigued
the poor beast was in fact going at a walk
are you going to areas
added the road mender
yes
if you go on at that rate you will not arrive very early
he stopped his horse and asked the laborer how far is it from here to areas
nearly seven good leagues
how is that
the posting guide only says five leagues and a quarter
ah
returned the road mender so youdon''t know that the road is under repair
you will find it barred a quarter of an hour further on there is no way to proceed further
really
you will take the road on the left leading to c agency you will cross the river when you reach c amblin you will turn to the right that is the road to mont sainte lot which leads to areas
but it is night and i shall lose my way
you do not belong in these parts
no
and besides it is all crossroads shop
sir resumed the road mender shall i give you a piece of advice
your horse is tired return to conquest here is a good inn there sleep there you can reach areas tomorrow
i must be there this evening
that is different but go to the inn all the same and get an extra horse the stable boy will guide you through the crossroads
he followed the road mender's advice retraced his steps and half an hour later he passed the same spot again but this time at full speed with a good horse goal was table boy who called himself a postilion was seated on the shaft of the car joke
still he felt that he had lost time
night had fully come
they turned into the crossroad the way became frightfully had the cart lurched from one guy to the other he said to the postilion keep at a trot and you shall have a double fee
in one of the iolta the shuffle free broke
there's the shuffle free broken sir said the postilion idon't know how to harness my horse now this road is very bad at night if you wish to return and sleep art in ques we could be in areas early tomorrow morning
he replied have you a bit of rope and a knife
yes sir
he cut a branch from a tree and made a whiff letter of it
this caused another loss of twenty minutes but they set out again at a gallop
the plain was gloomy low hanging black crisp dogs crept over the hills and wrenched themselves away like smoke there were whitish gleams in the clouds a strong breeze which blew in from the sea produced a sound in all quarters of the horizon as of someone moving furniture everything that could be seen assumed attitudes of terror
how many things shiver beneath these vast breaths of the night
he was stiff with cold he had eaten nothing since the night before he vaguely recalled his other nocturnal trip in the vast plain in the neighborhood of weight years previously and it seemed but yesterday
the hours truck from a distant tower he asked the boy what time is it
seveno'clock sir we shall reach areas at eight we have but three leagues still to go
at that moment he for the first time indulged in this reflection thinking it off the while that it has not occurred to him sooner that all this trouble which he was taking was perhaps useless that he did not know so much as the hour of the trial that he should at least have informed himself of that that he was foolish to go thus straight ahead without knowing whether he would be of any service or not the the sketched out some calculations in his mind that ordinarily the sittings of the court of assizes began at nineo'clock in the morning that it could not be a long affair that the theft of the apples would be very brief that there would then remain only a question of identity four or five depositions and very little for the lawyers to say that he should arrive after all was over
the postilion whipped up the horses they had crossed the river and left mont sainte lot behind them
the night grew more profound
chapter vi sisters implode put to the proof but at that moment fan time was joyous
she had passed a very bad night her cough was frightful here ever had doubled in intensity she had had dreams in the morning when the doctor paid his visits he was delirious he assumed an alarmed look and ordered that he should be informed as soon as m
madeleine arrived
all the morning she was melancholy said but little and laid plaits in her sheets murmuring the while in a low voice calculations which seemed to be calculations of distances
her eyes were hollow and sharing
they seemed almost extinguished at intervals then lighted up again and shone like stars
it seems as though at the approach of a certain dark hour the light of heaven fills those who are quitting the light of earth
each time that sisters implode asked her how she felt she replied invariably well
i should like to seek
madeleine
some months before this at the moment when fan time had just lost her last modesty her last shame and her last joy she was the shadow of herself how she was the spectre of herself
physical suffering had completed the work of moral suffering
this creature office and twenty had a wrinkled brow flabby cheeks pinched nostrils teeth from which the guns had receded a leaden complexion agony back prominent shoulder blades trail limbs a clayey skin and her golden hair was growing out sprinkled with gray
alas
how illness in provides old age
at midday the physician returned have some directions inquired whether the mayor had made his appearance at the infirmary and shook his head
m
madeleine usually came to see the invalid at threeo'clock
as exactness is kindness he was exact
about half past two can find began to be restless
in the course of twenty minutes she asked them in more than ten times what time is it sister
threeo'clock struck
at the third stroke can times at join beds he who could in general hardly turnover joined her yellow flesh less hands in a sort of convulsive clasp and then unheard her utter one of those profound signs which seem to throw off rejection
the grant i returned and looked at the door
no one entered the door did not open
she remained this for a quarter of an hour her eyes riveted on the door motionless and apparently holding her breath
the sister dared not speak to her
the clock struck a quarter past three
can nine fell back on her pillow
she said nothing but began to plait the sheets once more
half an hour passed then an hour no one came every time the clock struck can find started up and looked towards the door then fell back again
her thought was clearly perceptible but she uttered noname she made no complaints be blamed no one
but she counted in a melancholy way
one would have said that something dark was descending upon her
she was livid and her lips were blue
she smiled now and then
fiveo'clock struck
then the sister heard her say very low and gently he is wrong not to come today since i am going away tomorrow
sisters implode herself was surprised at m
madeleine's delay
in the meantime fan time was staring at the tester of her bed
she seemed to be endeavoring to recall something
all at once she began to sing in a voice as treble as a breath
thehun listened
this is what can tune was singing lovely things we will buy a sweet roll the faubourg's through
roses are pink corn flowers are blue i love my love corn flowers are blue
yes here's n. the virgin mary came near my's five in a brood freemantle clad and said to me' here hide' neath my veil the child whom you one day begged from me
haste to the city buy linen buy a needle buy thread
' lovely things we will buy a sweet roll the faubourg's through
dear holy virgin beside my stove i have set a cradle with ribbon wrecked
god may give me his loveliest star i prefer the child thou hast granted me
' madame what shall i do with this linen fine
'' make of it clothes for thy newborn babe
' roses are pink and corn flowers are blue i love my love and corn flowers are blue
' wash this linen
'' where
'' in the stream
make of its oiling not spooling not a petticoat fair with its god i define which i will embroider and fill with flowers
'' madame the child is no long true re what is to be done
'' then make of its winding sheet in which to bury me
' lovely things we will but as we stroll the faubourg's through roses are pink cornflower save blue i love my love corn flowers are blue
this song was an old cradle romance with which she had informed days pulled her little cosette to sleep and which had never recorded to her mind in all the five years during which she had been parted from her child
she sang it in so sad a voice and to so sweet an air that it was enough to make anyone even an unwed p
the sister accustomed as she was to austerities felt a year spring to her eyes
the clock struck six
fan time did not seem to hear it
she no longer seemed to pay attention to anything about her
sister simplices enya serving maid to inquire of the port tess of the fact ity whether the mayor had returned and if he would not come to the infirmary soon
the girl returned in a few minutes
fan time was still motionless and seemed absorbed in her own thoughts
the servant informed sisters implode in a very low tone that the mayor had set out that morning before sixo'clock in a little tilbury harnessed to a white horse cold as the weather was that he had gone alone without even a driver that no one knew what road he had taken that people said he had been seen to turn into the road to areas that others asserted that they had met him on the road to paris
that when he went away he had been very gentle as usual and that he had merely told the porters's not to expect him that night
while the two women were whispering together with their backs turned to fan time's bed the sister interrogating the servant connect uring tannins with the feverish vivacity of certain organic maladies which unite the free movements of health with the frightful emaciation of death had raised herself to her knees in bed with her shrivelled hands resting on the bolster and her head thrust through the opening of the curtains and was listening
all at once she cried you are speaking of m
madeleine
why are you talking so low
what is he doing
why does he not come
her voice was so abrupt and hoarse that the two women thought they heard the voice of a man they wheeled found in affright
answer me
cried fan time
the servant stammered the port read told me that he could not come today
be calm my child said the sister lie down again
fan time without changing her attitude continued in a loud voice and with an accent that was both imperious and heartrending he can not come
why not
you know the reason
you are whispering it to each other there
i want to know it
the servant make hastened to say in the nun's ear say that he is busy with the city council
sisters implode blushed faintly for it was a lie that the maid had proposed to her
on the other hand it seemed to her that the here communication of the truth to the invalid would without doubt deal her a terrible blow and that this was a serious matter infant one's present state
her flush did not last long the sister raised her calm sad eyes tocantins and said monsieur lemaire has gone away
fan time raised herself and crouched on her heels in the new her eyes sparkled indescribable joy beamed from that melancholy face
none
she cried he has gone to get cosette
then she raised her arms to heaven and her white face became ineffable her lips moved she was praying in a low voice
when her prayer was finished sister she said i am willing to lie down again i will do anything you wish i was naughty just now i beg your pardon for having spoken so loud it is very wrong to talk loudly i know that we'll my good sister but you see i am very happy the good god is good m
madeleine is good just think
he has gone to mont vermeil to get my little cosette
she lay down again with the nun's assistance helped them into arrange her pillow and kissed the little silver cross which she wore on her neck and which sisters impl i've had given her
my child said the sister try to rest now and do not talk anymore
can find took the sister's hand in her moist hands and the latter was pained to feel that perspiration
he set out this morning for parks in fact he need not even go through paris mont vermeil is a little to the left as you come thence
do you remember how he said to me yesterday when i spoke to him of cosette soon soon
he wants to give me a surprise you know
he made me signal enter so that she could be taken from the then add legs they can not say anything can they
they will give back cosette for they have been paid the authorities will not allow them to keep the child since they have received their pay
do not make signs to me that i must not talk sister
i am extremely happy i am going well i am not ill at all anymore i am going to see cosette again i am even quite hungry it is nearly five years since i saw her last you can not imagine how much attached one gets to children and then she will be so pretty you will see
if you only knew what pretty little rosy fingers she had
in the first place she will have very beautiful hands she had ridiculous hands when she was only a year old like this
she must be a big girl now she is seven years old she is quite a young lady i call her cosette but her name is really e up tracie
shop
this morning i was looking at the dust on the chimney piece and i had a sort of idea come across me like that that i should see cosette again soon
mon dieu
how wrong it is not to see one's children for years
one ought to reflect that life is not eternal
on his good m
lemaire is to go
it is very cold
it is true he had on his cloak at least
he will be here tomorrow will be not
tomorrow will be a festival day tomorrow morning sister you must remind me to put on my little cap that has pace on it
what a place that mont been ellis
i took that journey on foot once it was very long for me but the diligence ago very quickly
he will be here tomorrow with cosette how far is it from here to mont vermeil
the sister who had no idea of distances replied oh i think that he will be here tomorrow
tomorrow
tomorrow
said fan time i shall see cosette tomorrow
you see good sister of the good god that i am no longer illiam mad i could dance if anyone wished it
a person who had seen her a quarter of any our previously would not have understood the chance she was all rosy now she spoke in a lively and natural voice her whole face was one smile now and then she talked she laughed softly the joy of a mother is almost infantile
well resumed the nun now that you are happy mind me and do not talk anymore
fan time laid her head on her pillow and said in a low voice yes lie down again be good for you are going to have your child sisters uml life is right everyone here is right
and then without stirring without even moving her head she began to share all about her with wide open eyes and a joyous air and she said nothing more
the sister drew the curtains together again hoping that she would fall into a size
between seven and eighto'clock the doctors and not hearing any sound he thought fan time was asleep entered softly and approached the bed on tiptoe he opened the curtains a little and by the light of the tape guess we anyone's big eyes gazing at him
she said to him she will be allowed to sleep beside me in a little bed will she not sit
the doctor though r. that she was delirious
she added see
there is just room
the doctor took sister simplices side and she explained matters to him that m
madeleine was absent for a day or two and that in their doubt they had not thought it well to un receive the invalid who believed that the mayor had gone to mont vermeil that it was possible after all that her guess was correct the doctor approved
he returned to rent one's bed and she went on you see when she wakes up in the morning i shall be able to say good morning to her poor kitten and when i can not sleep at night i can hear her asleep her little gentle breathing will come good
give me your hand said the doctor
she stretched out her arm and exclaimed with a laugh at hold
in truth you did not know if i am cured cosette will arrive tomorrow
the doctor was surprised she was better the pressure on her chest had decreased her pulse had regained its strengths sort of life had suddenly super genes and reanimated this poor worn out creature
doctors he went on did the sister tell you that m
lemaire has gone to get that more of a child
the doctor recommended silence and that all painful emotions should be avoided be prescribed an infusion of pure c him china and in case the fever should increase again during the night a calming potion
as he took his departure he said to the sisters he is doing better if good luck willed that the mayor should actually arrive tomorrow with the child who knows
there are crises so astounding great joy has been known to arrest maladies i know well that this is an organic disease and in an advanced state buy all those things are such mysteries we may be able to save her
chapter vii the traveller on his arrival takes precautions for departure it was nearly eighto'clock in the evening when the cart which we left on the road entered the ported is here if the hotel de la poste in art as the man whom we have been following up to this moment alighted from it responded with an abstracted air to the attentions of the people of the inn sent back the extra horse and with his own hands led the little white horse to the stable then he opened the door of a billiard room which was situated on the ground floor sat down there and leaned his elbows on a table he had taken fourteen hours for the journey which he had counted on making in six he did himself the justice to acknowledge that it was not his fault but at bottom he was not worry
the landlady of the hotel entered
does monsieur wish aged
does monsieur required upper
he made a sign of the head in the negative
the stable man says that monsieur's horse is extremely fatigued
here he broke his silence
will not the horse be in a condition to set out again tomorrow morning
oh monsieur
he must rest for two days at least
he inquired is not the posting station located here
yes sir
the hostess conducted him to the office he showed his passport and inquired whether there was any way of returning that same night tom
shrm
by the mail wagon the seat beside the post boy chanced to be vacant he engaged it and paid for it
monsieur said the clerk do not fail to be here ready to start at precisely oneo'clock in the morning
this done he left the hotel and began to wander about the town
he was not acquainted with areas the streets were dark and he walked on at random but he seemed bent upon not asking the way of the passersby
he crossed the little river crunch on and found himself in a labyrinth of narrow alleys where he lost his way
a citizen was passing along with a lantern
after some hesitation he decided to apply to this man not without having first glanced behind and in front of him as though he feared lest someone should hear the question which he was about to put
monsieur said he where is the courthouse if you please
you do not belong in towns or
replied the bourgeois who was an old lehman we'll follow me
i happen to be going in the direction of the courthouse that is to say in the direction of the hotel of the prefecture for the courthouse is undergoing repairs just at this moment and the courts are holding their sittings provisionally on the prefecture
i sit there that these sizes are held
he asked
certainly sur you see the prefecture of today was the bishop's palace before the revolution
m
dec on air who was bishop in' built a grand hall there
it is in this grand hall that the court is held
on the way the bourgeois said to him if monsieur desires to witness a case it is rather late
the sittings generally close at sixo'clock
when they arrived on the grand square however the man pointed out to him four long windows all lighted up in the front of a vast and gloomy building
upon my words if you are in luck you have arrived in season
do you see those four windows
that is the court of assizes
there is light there so they are not through
the matter must have been greatly protracted and they are holding an evening session
do you take an interest in this affair
is it a criminal case
are you a witness
he replied i have not come on any business i only wish to speak to one of the lawyers
that is different said the bourgeois
stop sit here is the door where the sentry stands
you have only to ascend the grand staircase
he conformed to the bourgeois's directions and a few minutes later he was in a halo containing many people and where groups intermingled with lawyers in their towns were whispering together here and there
it is always a heartbreaking thing to see these congregations of men robed in black murmuring together in low voices on the threshold of the halls of justice
it is rare that charity and pity are the outcome of these words
condemnations pronounced in advance are more likely to be the result
all these groups seem to the passing and thoughtful observer so many sombre gives where buzzing spirits construct in concert all sorts of dark edifices
this spacious hall illuminated by a single lamp was the old hall of the episcopal palace and served as the large hall of the palace of justice
a double leaves door which was closed at that moment separated it from the large apartment where the court was sitting
the obscurity was such that he did not fear to accost the first lawyer whom he net
what stage have they reached air
he asked
it is finished said the lawyer
finished
this word was repeated in such accents that the lawyer turned round
excuse me air perhaps you are a relative
no i know no one here
has judgment been pronounced
of course
nothing else was possible
to penal servitude
for life
he continued in a voice so weak that it was barely audible then his identity was established
what identity
replied the lawyer
there was no identity to be established
the matter was very simple
the woman had murdered her child the infanticide was proved the jury threw out the question of pre meditation and she was condemned for life
so it was a woman
said he
why certainly
the limos in woman
of what are you speaking
nothing
but since it is all over how come air that the hall is still lighted
for another case which was begun about two hours ago
what other case
oh
this one is a clear case also
it is about a sort of blackguard a man arrested for a second offences convict who has been guilty of theft
idon't know his name exactly
there's a bandit's luiz for you
i'd send him to the valleys on the strength of his face alone
is there any way of getting into the courtroom air
said he
ideally think that there is not
there is a great crowd
however the hearing has been suspended
some people have gone out and when the hearing is resumed you might make an effort
where is the entrance
through yonder large door
the lawyer left him
in the course of a few moments he had experienced almost simultaneously almost intermingled with each other all possible emotions
the words of this in different spectator had in turn pierced his heart like needles of ice and like blades of fire
when he saw that nothing was settled he breathed freely once more but he could not have told whether what he felt was pain or pleasure
he drew near to many groups and listened to what they were saying
the docket of the session was very heavy the president had appointed for the same day two short and simple cases
they had begun with the infanticide and now they had reached the convict the old offender the return horse
this man had stolen apples but that did not appear to be entirely proved what had been proved was that he had already been in the galleys at toulon
it was that which lent a bad as left to his case
however the man's examination and the depositions of the witnesses had been completed but the lawyer's plea and the speech of the public prosecutor were still to come it could not be finished before midnight
the man would probably be condemned the attorney general was very clever and never missed his culprit she was a brilliant fellow who wrote verses
an usher stood at the door communicating with the hall of the assizes
he inquired of this usher will the door be opened sponsor
it will not be opened at all replied the usher
what
it will not be opened when the hearing is resumed
is not the hearing suspended
the hearing has just been begun again replied the usher but the door will not be opened again
why
because the hall is full
what
there is not room for one more
not another one
the door is closed
no one can enter now
the usher added after a pause there are to tell the truth two or three extra places behind monsieur le president but monsieur le president only admits public functionaries to them
so saying the usher turned his back
he retired with bowed head traversed the antechamber and slowly descended the stairs as though hesitating at every step
it is probable that he was holding counsel with himself
the violent conflict which has been going on within him since the preceding evening was not yet ended and every moment he encountered some new phase of it
on reaching the landing place he leaned his back against the balusters and folded his arms
all at once he opened his coat drew out his pocket book took from its pencil to rely take a band upon that lead he wrote rapidly by the light of the street lantern this line m
madeleine mayor of m
such
then he ascended the stairs once more with great strides made his way through the crowd walked straight up to the usher handed him the paper and said in an authoritative manner take this to monsieur le president
the usher took the paper cast a glance upon it and obeyed
chapter viii an entrance by favor although he did not suspect the fact the mayor of m
shrm
enjoyed a sort of celebrity
for the space of seven years his reputation for virtue has filled the whole of bad boy lonna is it had eventually passed the confines of a small district and had been spread abroad through two or three neighboring departments
besides the service which he had rendered to the chief town bureau sci hating the black jet industry there was not one out of the hundred and forty communes of the arrondissement of m
shrm
which was not indebted to him for some benefit
he had even at need contrived to aid and multiply the industries of other arrondissement s
it was thus that he had when occasion offered supported with his credit and his funds the linen factory at boulogne the road spinning industry at fervent and the hydraulic manufacture of cloth at bouvet sshrc anche
everywhere the name of m
madeleine was pronounced with generation
areas and do ya i envied the happy little town of m
shrm
it's mayor
the councillor of the royal court of douai who was presiding over this session of the assizes at areas as a acquainted in common with the rest of the world with this name which was so profoundly and universally honored
when the us ter discreetly opening the door which connected the council chamber with the courtroom bent over the back of the president's arm chair and handed him the paper on which was inscribed the line which we have just per user adding the gentleman desires to be present at the trial the president with a quick and deferential movement seized a pen and write a few words at the bottom of the paper and returned it to the usher saying admit him
the unhappy man whose history we are relating had remained near the door of the hall in the same place and the same attitude in which the usher had left him
in the midst of his're very be heard someone saying to him will monsieur done the honor to follow me
it was the same usher who had turned his back upon him but a moment previously and who was now bowing to the earth before him
at the same time the usher handed him the paper
he untold edit and as he chanced to be near the light he could read it
the president of the court of assizes presents his respects tom
madeleine
he crushed the paper in his hand as though those words contained for him a strange and bitter aftertaste
he followed the usher
a few minutes later he found himself alone in a sort of wainscot ed cabinet of severe aspect lighted by two wax candles placed upon a table with a green cloth
the last words of the usher who had just quitted him still rang in his ears monsieur you are now in the council chamber you have only to turn the copper handle of yonder door and you will find yourself in the courtroom behind the president's chair
these words were mingled in his thoughts with a vague memory of narrow corridors and dark staircases which he had recently traversed
the usher had left him alone
the supreme moment had arrived
he sought to collect his faculties but could not
it is chiefly at the moment when there is the greatest need for attaching them to the painful realities of life that the threads of thought snap within the brain
he was in the very place where the judges deliberated and condemned
with stupid tranquillity he surveyed this peaceful and terrible apartment where so many lives had been broken which was soon to ring with his name and which his fate was at that moment traversing
he stared at the wall then he looked at himself wondering that it should be that chamber and that it should be me
he had eaten nothing for four and twenty hours he was worn out by the jolts of the cart but he was not conscious of it
it seemed to him that he felt nothing
he approached a black frame which was suspended on the wall and which contained under glass an ancient autograph letter of jean nicola apache mayor of paris and minister and dated through an error no doubt they got june of the year ii
and in which pac be forwarded to the commune the list of ministers and deputies held in arrest by them
any spectator who had chanced to see him at that moment and who had watched him would have imagined doubtless that this letter struck him as very curious for he did not take his eyes from it and he read it two or three times
he read it without paying any attention to it and unconsciously
he was thinking of fan time and cosette
as he dreamed he turned round and his eyes fell upon the brass knob of the door which separated him from the court of assizes
he had almost forgotten that door
his glance calm at first paused there remained fixed on that brass handle then grew terrified and little by little became impregnated with fear
beads of perspiration burst forth among his hair and trickled down upon his temples
at a certain moment he made that indescribable gesture of a sort of authority mingled with rebellion which is intended to convey and which does so well convey par disk
who compels me to this
then he wheeled briskly round caught sight of the door through which he had entered in front of him went to it opened it and passed out
he was no longer in that chamber he was outside in a corridor along narrow corridor broken by steps and gratings making all sorts of angles lighted here and thereby lanterns similar to the night taper of invalids the corridor through which he had approached
he breathed he listened not a sound in front not a sound behind him and he fled as though pursued
when he had turned many angles in this corridor he still listened
the same silence reigned and there was the same darkness around him
he was out of breath he staggered he leaned against the wall
the stone was sold the perspiration lay ice cold on his brow he straightened himself up with a shiver
then there alone in the darkness trembling with cold and with something else too perchance he hesitated
he had meditated all night long he had meditated all the day he heard within him but one voice which said alas
a quarter of an hour passed this
at length he bowed his head signed with agony dropped his arms and retraced his steps
he walked slowly and as though crushed
it seemed as though someone had overtaken him in his flight and was leading him back
here entered the council chamber
the first thing he caught sight of sas the knob of the door
this knot which was found and of polished brass shone like a terrible star for him
he gazed at it as a lamb might gaze into the eye of a tiger
he could not take his eyes from it
from time to time he advanced a step and approached the door
had he listened it would have heard the sound of the adjoining hall like a sort of confused murmur but he did not listen and he did not hear
suddenly without himself knowing how it happened he found himself near the door he grasped the knob convulsively the door opened
he was in the courtroom
chapter is a place where convictions are in process of formation he advanced space closer the door mechanically behind him and remained standing contemplating what he saw
it was a vast and badly lighted apartment now full of uproar now full of silence where all the apparatus of a criminal case with its petty and mournful gravity in the midst of the throng was in process of development
at the one end of them all the one where he was were judged with abstracted akron threadbare robes who were gnawing their nails or closing their eyelids at the other end a ragged crowd lawyers in all sorts of attitudes soldiers with hard but honest faces ancient spotted woodwork a dirty ceiling tables covered with serve that was yellow rather than green doors blackened by hand marie tap room lamps which emitted more smoke than light suspended from nails in the wainscot on the tables candles in brass candle sticks darkness ugliness sadness and from all this there was disengaged an austere and august impression for one there felt that grand human thing which is called the law and that grand divine thing which is called justice
no one in all that throng paid any at henrion to him all glances were directed towards a single point a wooden bench placed against a small door in the stretch of wall on the president's left on this bench illuminated by several candles data man between two gender mas
this man was the man
he did not seek him he saw him his eyes went thither naturally as though they had known beforehand where that figure was
he thought he was looking at himself grown old not absolutely the same in face of course but exactly similar in attitude and aspect with his bristling hair with that wild and uneasy eye with that blouse just as it was on the day when he entered d full of hatred concealing his soul in that hideous mass of frightful thoughts which he had spent nineteen years in collecting on the floor of the prison
he said to himself with a shudder good god
shall i become like that again
this creature seemed to be at least sixty there was something indescribably coarse stupid and frightened about him
at the sound made by the opening door people had drawn aside to make way for him the president had turned his head and understanding that the person age who had just entered was the mayor of m
shrm
he has vowed to him the attorney general who had seen m
madeleine atm
shrm
whither the duties of his office had called him more than once recognized him and saluted him also he had hardly perceived it he was the victim of a sort of hallucination he was watching
judges clerks gendarmes a throng of cruelly curious heads all these he had already be held once in days gone by twenty seven years before he had encountered those fatal things once more there they were they moved they existed it was no longer an effort of his memory ami rate of his thought they were real gendarmes and real judge's a real crowd and real men of flesh and blood it was all over me he held the monstrous aspects of his past reappear and live once more around him with all that there is formidable in reality
all this was yawning before him
he was horrified by it be shut his eyes and exclaimed in the deepest recesses of his soul never
and by a tragic play of destiny which made all his ideas tremble and rendered him nearly had it was another self of his that was there
all called that man who was being tried jean valjean
under his very eyes unheard of vision he had a sort of representation of the most horrible moment of his life enacted by his spectre
everything was there the apparatus was the same them out of the night the faces of the judges of soldiers and of spectators all were the same only above the president's head there hung a crucifix something which the courts had lacked at the time of his condemnation god had been absent when he had been judged
there was a chair behind him he dropped into it terrified at the thought that he might be seen when he was seated he took advantage of a pile of cardboard boxes which stood on the judge's desk to conceal his face from the whole room he could now see without being seen he had fully regained consciousness of the reality of things gradually be recovered he attained that phase of composure where it is possible to listen
m
bama taboos was one of the jurors
he looked for javert but did not see him the seat of the witnesses was hidden from him by the clerk's table and then as we have just said the hall was spa rely lighted
at the moment of this entrance the defendant's lawyer had just finished his plea
the attention of all was excited to the highest pitch the affair has lasted for three hours for three hours that crowd has been watching a strange man a miserable specimen of humanity either profoundly stupid or profoundly subtle gradually bending beneath the weight of a terrible likeness
this man as the reader already knows was a vagabond who had been found in a field carrying a branch laden with ripe apple's broken in the orchard of a neighbor called the pie from orchard
who was this man
an examination had been made witnesses had been heard and they were unanimous light had a bounded throughout the entire debate the accusation said we have in our grasp not only a marauder a stealer of fruit we have here in our hands a bandit an old offender who has broken his banamex convict a miscreant of the most dangerous description a male factor named jean valjean whom justice has long been in search of and who eight years ago on emerging from the galleys at toulon committed a highway robbery accompanied by violence on the person of a child a savoyard named little gervais a crime provided for by article of the penal code the right to try him for which we reserve hereafter when his identity shall have been judicially established
he has just committed a fresh theft it is a case of a second offence condemn him for the fresh deed later on he will be judged for the old crime
in the face of this accusation in the face of the unanimity of the witnessed the accused appeared to be astonished more than anything else he made signs and gestures which were meant to convey no or else he stared at the ceiling he spoke with difficulty replied with embarrassment but his whole person from head to do it was a denial he was an idiot in the presence of all these kinds ranged in order of battle around him and like a stranger in the midst of this society which was seizing fast upon him nevertheless it was a question of the most menacing future for him the likeness increased every moment and the entire crowd surveyed with more anxiety than he did himself that sentence freighted with calamity which descended ever closer over his head there was even a glimpse of a possibility afforded besides the galleys a possible death penalty in case his identity were established and the affair of little gervais were to end thereafter in condemnation
who was this man
what was the nature of his apathy
was it imbecility or craft
did he under stand too well or did he not understand at all
these were questions which divides the crowd and seemed to divide the jury there was something both terrible and puzzling in this case the drama was not only melancholy it was also obscure
the counsel for the defence had spoken tolerably well in that provincial tongue which has long constituted the eloquence of the bar and which was formerly employed by all advocates at paris as well as at rom or anti not a thong brison and which today having become classic is no longer spoken except by the official orators of magistracy to whom it is suited on account of its grave sonorous news and its majestic strides tongue in which a husband is called a consort and a woman a spouse paris the centre of art and civilization the king the monarch monseigneur the bishops sainted pontiff the district attorney the eloquent interpreter of public prosecution the arguments the accents which we have just listened to the age of louis xiv
the grand area theatre the temple of melpomene the reigning family the august blood of our king's a concerts musical solemnity the general commandant of the province the illustrious warrior who etc.
the pupils in the seminary the set enderle cities errors imputed to newspapers the imposture which distills its venom through the columns of those organs etc.
the lawyer had accordingly begun with an explanation as to the theft of the apple's an awkward matter couched in fine style but benign e bosquet himself was obliged to allude to a chicken in the midst of a funeral oration and he extricated himself from the situation in stately fashion
the lawyer established the fact that the theft of the apples had not been circumstantial it proved
his client whom he in his character of counsel persisted in calling champ mathieu had not been seen scaling that wall not breaking that branch by anyone
he has been taken with that branch which the lawyer preferred to call about him his possession but he said that he had found it broken off and lying on the ground and had picked it up
where was there any proof to the contrary
no doubt that branch had been broken off and concealed after the scaling of the wall then thrown away by the alarmed marauder there was no doubt that there had been a thief in the case
but what proof was there that that thief had been champ mathieu
one thing only
his shared texas and a convict
the lawyer did not deny that that character appeared to being so polywell attested the accused had resided at face rolled the accused had exercised the calling of a tree pruner there the name of champ mathieu might well have had its origin in jean mathieu all that was true in short four witnesses recognize champ mathieu positively and without hesitation as that convict jean valjean to the designs to this test l joni the counsel could oppose nothing but the denial of his client the denial of an interested party but supposing that he was the convict jean valjean did that prove that he was the thief of the apples
that was a presumption at the most got a proof
the prisoner it was true and his counsel in good faith was obliged to admit it had adopted a bad system of defence
he obstinately denied everything hhe hheft and his character of convict
an admission upon this last point would certainly have been better and would have won for him the indulgence of his judges the counsel had advised him to do this but the accused had obstinately refused thinking no doubt that he would save everything by admitting nothing
it was an error but ought not the paucity of this intelligence to be taken into consis station
this man was visibly stupid
long continued wretchedness in the galleys long misery outside the galleys had brutalized him etc.
he defended himself badly was that a reason for condemning him
as for the affair with little gervais the counsel need not discuss it it did not enter into the case
the lawyer wound up by beseeching the jury and the court of the identity of jean valjean appeared to them to be evident to apply to him the police penalties which are provided for a criminal who has broken his bag and not the frightful chastisement which descends upon the convict guilty of a second offence
the district attorney answered the counsel for the defence
he was violent and florida's district attorney's usually are
he congratulated the counsel for the defence on his loyalty and skilfully took advantage of this loyalty
he reached the accused through all the concessions made by his lawyer
the advocate had seemed to admit that the prisoner was jean valjean
he took note of this
so this man was jean valjean
this point had been dog ceded to the accusation and could no longer be disputed
here by means of a clever autonomas ia which went back to the sources and causes of crime the district attorney thundered against the immorality of the romantic school then dawning under the name of the satanic school which had been bestowed upon it by the critics of the quotidienne and their if i am mehr attributed not without some probability to the influence of this perverse literature the crime of stamp mathieu or rather to speak more correctly of jean valjean
having exhausted these considerations he passed onto jean valjean himself
who was this jean valjean
description of jean valjean a monster spewed forth etc.
the model for this sort of description is contained in the tale of the game ne which is not useful to tragedy but which every day renders great services to judicial eloquence
the audience and the jury shuddered
the description finished the district attorney resumed with an oratorical turn calculated to raise the enthusiasm of the journal of the prefecture to the highest pitch on the following day and it is such a man etc.
etc.
etc.
vagabond beggar without means of existence etc.
etd
inured by his past life to culpable deeds and but little reformed by his sojourn in the galleys as was proved by the crime committed against little gervais etc.
etc.
it is such a man caught up on the highway in the very act of theft a few paces from a wall that had been scaled still holding in his hand the object stolen who denies the crime the theft the climbing the wall denies everything denied even his own identity
in addition to a hundred other proofs to which we will not recur four witnesses recognize him javert the upright inspector of police javert and three of his former companions in infamy the convicts brevet chen old iei and so she is ille
what does he offer in opposition to this overwhelming unanimity
his denial
what of curacy
you will do justice gentlemen of the jury etc.
etc.
while the district attorney was speaking the accused listened to him open mouthed with a sort of amazement in which some semi ration was assuredly blended
he was evidently surprised that a man could talk like that
from time to time at those energetic moments of the prosecutor's speech when eloquence which can not contain itself overflows in a flood of withering epithets and envelops the accused like a storm he moved his head slowly from right to left and from left to right in the sort of mute and melancholy protest with which he had contented himself since the beginning of the argument
two or three times the spectators who were nearest to him heard him say in a low voice that is what comes of not having asked m
gallup
the district attorney directed the attention of the jury to this stupid attitude evidently deliberate which denotes not imbecility but craft skills habit of receiving justice and which set forth in all its nakedness the profound perversity of this man
he ended by making his reserves on the affair of little gervais and demanding a severe sentence
at that time as the reader will remember it was penal servitude for life
the counsel for the defense rose began by complimenting monsieurl' avocat general on his admirable speech then replied as best he could but he weakened the ground was evidently slipping away from under his feet
chapter x. the system of denials the moment for closing the debate had arrived
the president had the accused stand up and addressed to him the customary question have you anything to add to your defence
the man did not appear to understand as he stood there twisting in his hands a terrible cap which he had
the president repeated the question
this time the man heard it
he seemed to understand
he made a motion like a man who is just waking up cast his eyes about him stared at the audience the gendarmes his counsel the jury the court laid his monstrous fish on the rim of wood work in front of his bench took another look and all at once fixing his glance upon the district attorney he began to speak
it was like an eruption
it seemed from the manner in which the words escaped from his mouth incoherent impetuous pwllheli tumbling over each other as though they were all pressing forward to issue for that once
he said this is what i have to say
that i have been a wheelwright in paris and that it was with monsieur ball up
it is a hard trade
in the wheelwright's trade one works always on the open air in courtyards under sheds when the masters are good never in closed workshops because space is required you see
in winter one gets so cold that one beats one's arms together to warm one's self but the mastersdon't like it they say it wastes time
handling iron when there is ice between the paving stones is hard work
that wears a man out quickly
one is old while he is still quite young in that trade
at forty a man is done for
i was fifty three
i was in a bad state
and then work men are some am
when a man is no longer young they call him nothing but an old bird old beast
i was not earning more than thirty sousa day
they paid me as little as possible
the masters took advantage of my age and then i had my daughter who was a laundress at the river
she earned a little also
it suffices for us two
she had trouble also all day long up to her waist in a tub in rain in snow
when the wind cuts your face when it freezes it is all the same you must still wash
there are people who have not much linen and wait until late if you do not wash you lose your custom
the planks are badly joined and water drops on you from everywhere you have your petticoats all camp above and below
that penetrates
she has also worked at the laundry of the enfants rouge's where the water comes through faucets
you are not in the tub there you wash at the faucet in front of you and rinse in a basin behind you
as it is enclosed you are not so cold but there is that hits team which is terrible and which ruins your eyes
she came home at seveno'clock in the evening and went to bed at once she was so tired
her husband heather
she is dead
we have not been very happy
she was a good girl who did not go to the ball and who was very peaceable
i remember one shrove tuesday when she went to bed at eighto'clock
there i am telling the truth you have only to ask
ah yes
how stupid i am
paris is a gulf
who knows father champ mathieu there
but m
gallup does i tell you
go see atm
gallup's and after all idon't know what is wanted of me
the man ceased speaking and remained standing
he had said these things in a loud rapid hoarse voice with a sort of irritated and savage ingenuous news
once he paused to salute someone in the crowd
the sort of affirmations which he seemed to flung out before him at random cane like bid counts and to each he added the gesture of a woodcutter who is splitting wood
when he had finished the audience burst into a laugh
he stared at the public and perceiving that they were laughing and not understanding why he began to laugh himself
it was inauspicious
the president an attentive and benevolent man raised his voice
he reminded the gaggle men of the jury that the sieur ball up formerly a master wheelwright with whom the accused stated that he had served had been summoned in vain
he had become bankrupt and was not to be found
then turning to the accused been joined him to listen to what he was about today and added you are in a position where reflection is necessary
the gravest presumptions rest upon you and may induce vital results
prisoner in your own interests i summon you for the last time to explain yourself clearly on two points
in the first place did you or did you not climb the wall of the pierron orchard break the branch and steal the apples that is to say commit the crime of breaking in and theft
in the second place are you the discharged convict jean valjean yes or no
the prisoner shook his head with scalable air like a man who has thoroughly understood and who knows what answer he is going to make
he opened his mouth turned towards the president and said in the first place then he stared at his cap stared at the ceiling and held his peace
prisoner said the district attorney in a severe voice pay attention
you are not answering anything that has been asked if you
your embarrassment condemns you
it is evident that your name is not champ mathieu that you are the convict jean valjean concealed first under the name of mean mathieu which was the game of his mother that you went to auvergne that you were born a trade rolled where you were a primer of trees
it is evident that you have been guilty of entering and of the theft of ripe apples from the pierron orchard
the gentlemen of the jury will form their own opinion
illustration father champ mathieu in trial the prisoner had finally resumes his seat he arose abruptly when the district attorney had finished and exclaimed you are very wicked that you are
this what i wanted to say i could not find words for it at first
i have stolen nothing
i am a man who does not have something to eat every day
i was coming from silly i was walking through the country after a shower which has made the whole country yellow even the ponds were overflowed and nothing sprang from the same anymore but the little blades of grass at the wayside
i found a broken branch with apples on the ground i picked up the branch without knowing that it would get me into trouble
i have been in prison and they have been dragging me about for the last three months more than that i can not say people talk against me they tell me' answer
' the gendarme who is a good fellow judges my elbow and says time in a low voice' come answer
' idon't know how to explain i have no education i am a poor man that is where they wrong me because they do not see this
i have not stolen i picked up from the ground things that were lying there
you say jean valjean jean mathieu
idon't know those persons they are villagers
i worked form
halo up boulevard del' hopital my name is champ mathieu
you are very clever to tell me where i was born idon't know myself it's not everybody who has a house in which to come into the world that would be too convenient
i think that my father and mother were people who strolled along the highways i know nothing different
when i was a child they called me young fellow now they call me old fellow those are my baptismal names take that as you like
i have been in auvergne i have been a trade rolled
parsi
well
can'ta man have been in auvergne or at face rolled without having been in the galleys
i tell you that i have not stolen and that i am father champ mathieu i have been with m
gallup i have had a settled residence
you worry me with your nonsense there
why is everybody pursuing me so furiously
the district attorney had remained standing be addressed the president monsieur le president in view of the confused but exceedingly clever denials of the prisoner who would like to pass himself off as an idiot but who will not succeed in so doing we shall attend to that we demand that it shall please you and that it shall please the court to summon once more into this place the convicts brevet coche paulie and when il dish and police inspector javert and question them for the last time as to the identity of the prisoner with the convict jean valjean
i would remind the district attorney said the president that police inspector javert recalled by his duties to the capital of a neighboring arrondissement left the courtroom and the town as soon as he has made his deposition we have accorded him permission with the consent of the district attorney and if the counsel for the prisoner
that is true mr
president responded the district attorney
in the absence of sieur javert i think it my duty to remind the gentlemen of the jury of what he said here a few hours ago
javert is an estimable man who does honor by his rigorous and strict probity to inferior but important functions
these are the terms of his deposition' i do not even stand in need of circumstantial proofs and moral presumptions to give the lie to the prisoner's denial
i recognize him perfectly
the name of this man is not champ mathieu he is a bed convict named jean valjean and is very vicious and much to be feared
it is only with extreme regret that he was released at the expiration of his term
he underwent nineteen years of penal servitude for the ff
he made five or six attempts to escape
besides the theft from little gervais and from the pierron orchard i suspect him of a theft committed in the house of his grace the late bishop of di often saw him at the time when i was adjutant of the valley guard at the prison in toulon
i repeat that i recognize him perfectly
' this extremely precise statement appeared to produce a big id impression on the public and on the jury
the district attorney concluded by insisting that in default of javert the three witnesses brevet chen il dish and coche paul le should be heard once more and solemnly interrogated
the president transmitted the order to a gusher and a moment later the door of the witnesses' room opened
the usher accompanied by a gendarme ready to lend him armed assistance introduced the convict brevet
the audience was in suspense and all breasts headed as though they had contained but one soul
the ex convict brevet wore the black and gray waistcoat of the central prisons
brevet was a person sixty years of age who had a sort of b usiness man's face and the air of a rascal
the two sometimes go together
in prison whither fresh misdeeds had led him he had become something in the nature of a turnkey
he was a man of whom his superiors said he tries to make himself of use
the chaplain's note good testimony as to his religious habits
it must not be forgotten that this passed under the restoration
brevet said the president you have undergone an ignominious sentence and you can not take an oath
brevet dropped his eyes
nevertheless continued the president even in the man whom the law has degraded there may remain when the divine mercy permits it a sentiment of honor age of equity
it is to this sentiment that i appeal at this decisive hour
if it still exists in you and i hope it does reflect before replying to me consider on the one hand this man whom a word from you may ruin on the other hand justice which a word from you may enlighten
the instant is solemn there is still time to retract if you think you have been mistaken
rise prisoner
brevet take a good look at the accused recall your souvenirs and tell us on your soul and conscience if you persist in recognizing this man as your former companion in the galleys jean valjean
brevet looked at the prisoner then turned towards the court
yes mr
president i was the first to recognize him and i stick to it that man is jean valjean who entered at toulon in and left in
i left a year later
he has the air of a brute now but it must be because she has brutalized him he was spy at the galleys i recognize him positively
take your seat said the president
prisoner remain standing
chen il dish was brought in a prisoner for life as was indicated by tossed cassock and his green cap
he was serving out his sentence at the valleys of toulon whence he had been brought for this case
he was a small man of about fifty brisk wrinkled trail yellow brazen faced feverish who had a sort of sicily feeble news about all his limbs and his whole person and an immense force in his glance
his companions in the galleys had nicknamed him i deny god is nie wie ich emil didi
the president addressed him in nearly the same words which he had used to brevet
at the moment when here hinder him of his infamy which deprived him of the right to take an oath chen old key raised his head and looked the crowd in the face
the president invited him to reflection and asked him as he had asked brevet if he persisted in recognition of the prisoner
chen ile leu burst out laughing
par dieu as if i didn't recognize him
we were attached to the same chain for five years
so you are sulking old fellow
to take your seat said the president
the usher brought in coche paulie
he was another convict for life who had come from the valleys and was dressed in red like chen il dish was a peasant from lourdes and a half fear of the pyrenees
he had guarded the food is among the mountains and from a shepherd he had slipped into a brigand
coche paul it was no less savage and seemed even more stupid than the prisoner
he was one of those wretched men whom nature has sketched out for wild beasts and on whom society puts the finishing touches as convicts in the galleys
the president tried to touch him with some grave and pathetic words and asked him as he had asked the other two if he persisted without hesitation or trouble in recognizing the man who was standing before him
he is jean valjean said coche paul le
he was even called mean the screw because he was so strong
each of these affirmations from these three men evidently sincere and in good faith had raised in the audience a murmur of bad augury for the prisoner a murmur which increased and lasted longer each time that a fresh declaration was added to the proceeding
the prisoner had listened to them with that astounded face which was according to the accusation his principal means of defence at the first the gendarmes his neighbors had heard him mutter between his teeth ah well he's a nice one
after the second he said a little louder with an air that was almost that of satisfaction good
at the third he cried famous
the president addressed him have you heard prisoner
what have you to say
he replied i say' famous
' an uproar broke out among the audience and was communicated to the jury it was evident that the man was lost
ushers said the president enforce silence
i am going to sum up the arguments
at that moment there was a movement just beside the president a voice was heard crying brevet
chen il dish
coche paulie
look here
all who heard that voice were chilled so lamentable and terrible was it all eyes were turned to the point whence it had proceeded
a man placed among the privileged spectators who were seated behind the court had just risen had pushed open the half door which separates the tribunal from the audience and was standing in the middle of them all the president the district attorney m
bama taboos twenty persons recognized him and exclaimed in concert m
madeleine
chapter xi champ mathieu more and more astonished it was being act
the clerk's lamp illumined his countenance
he held his hat in his hand there was no disorder in his clothing his coat was carefully buttoned he was very pale and he trembled slightly his hair which had still been gray on his arrival in areas was now entirely white it had turned white during the hour he had sat there
all heads were raised the sensation was indescribable there was a momentary hesitation in the audience the voice had been so heartrending the man who stood there appeared so calm that they did not understand at first
they asked themselves whether he had indeed uttered that cry they could not believe that that tranquil man had been the one to give that terrible outcry
this indecision only lasted a few seconds
even before the president and the district attorney could utter a word before the ushers and the gendarmes could make a gesture the man whom all still called at that moment m
madeleine had advanced towards the witnesses coche paul left ever and chen il dish
do you not recognize me
said he
all three remained speechless and indicated by a sign of the head that they did not know him
coche paul le who was intimidated made a military salute
m
madeleine turned towards the jury and the court and said in a gentle voice gentlemen of the jury order the prisoner to be released
mr
president gave me arrested
he is not the man whom you are in search of it is liam jean valjean
not a mouth breathed the first commotion of astonishment had been followed by a silence like that of the grave those within the hall experienced that sort of religious terror which seizes the masses when something grand has been done
in the meantime the face of the president was stamped with sympathy and sadness he had exchanged a rapid sign with the district attorney and a few low tones words with the assistant judges be addressed the public and asked in accents which all understood is there a physician present
the district attorney took the word gentlemen of the jury the very strange and unexpected incident which disturbs the audience inspires us like yourselves only with a sentiment which it is unnecessary for us to express
you all know by reputation at least the honorable m
madeleine mayor of m
euro
if there is a physician in the audience we join the president in requesting him to attend tom
madeleine and to conduct him to his home
m
madeleine did not allow the district attorney to finish he interrupted him in accents full of sha city and authority
these are the words which he uttered here they are literally as they were written down immediately after the trial by one of the witnesses to this scene and as they now ring in the ears of those who heard them nearly forty years ago i thank you mr.
district attorney but i am not mad you shall see you were on the point of committing a great error release this man
i am fulfilling a duty i am that miserable criminal
i am the only one here who sees the matter clearly and i am telling you the truth
god who is on high looks down on what i am doing at this moment and that suffices
you can take me for here i am but i have done my best i concealed myself under another name i have become rich i have become a mayor i have tried to reenter the ranks of the honest
it seems that that is not to be done
in short there are many things which i can not help
i will not narrate the story of my life to you you will hear it one of these days
i robbed monseigneur the bishop it is true it is true that i robbed little gervais they were right in telling you that jean valjean was a very vicious wretch
perhaps it was not altogether his fault
listen honorable judge's
a man who has been so greatly humbled as i have had neither any remonstrances to make to providence nor any advice to give to society but you see the infamy from which i have tried to escape is an injurious thing the galleys make the convict what he is reflect upon that if you please
before going to the galleys i was a poor peasant with very little intelligence a sort of idiot the galleys drought a change in me
i was stupid i became vicious i was a block of wood i became a firebrand
later on indulgence and kindness saved me as severity had ruined me
but pardon me you can not understand what i am saying
you will find at my house among the ashes in the fireplace the north so i piece which i stole seven years ago from little gervais
i have nothing farther to add take me
good rod
the district attorney shakes his head you say' m
madeleine has gone mad
' you do not believe me
that is distressing
do not at least condemn this man
what
these men do not recognize me
i wish javert were here he would recognize me
nothing can reproduce the sombre and kindly melancholy of tone which accompanied these words
he turned to the three convicts and said well i recognize you do you remember brevet
he paused hesitated for an instant and said do you remember the knitted suspenders with a checked pattern which you wore in the galleys
brevet have a start of surprise and surveyed him from head to boot with a frightened air
he continued she nilfisk you who conferred on yourself the name of' jen is dieu' your whole right shoulder bears a deep burn because you one day la if your shoulder against the chafing dish full of coals in order to efface the three letters t
f
p
which are still visible nevertheless answer is this true
it is true said she nil dieu
he addressed himself to coche paul le coche paul le you have near the bend in your left arm a date stamped in blue letters with burnt powder the date is that of the landing of the emperor at cannes march pull up your sleeve
coche paul le pushed up his sleeve all eyes were focused on him and on his bare adm
a gendarme held a light close to it there was the date
the unhappy man turned to the spectators and the judges with a smile which still tends the hearts of all who saw it whenever they think of it
it was a smile of triumph it was also a smile of despair
you see plainly he said that i am jean valjean
in that chamber there were no longer either judge's accuser's not gendarmes there was nothing but staring eyes and sympathizing hearts
no one recalled any longer the part that each might be called upon to play the district attorney forgot he was there for the purpose of prosecuting the president that he was there to preside the counsel for the defence that he was there to defend
it was a striking circumstance that no question was put that no authority intervened
the peculiarity of sublime spectacles is that they capture all souls and turn witnesses into spectators
no one probably could have explained what he felt no one probably said to himself that he was witnessing the splendid outburst of a grand light all felt themselves inwardly dazzled
it was evident that they had jean valjean before their eyes
that was clear
the appearance of this man had sufficed to diffuse with light that matter which had been so obscure but a moment previously without any further explanation the whole crowd as by a sort of electric revelation understood instantly and at a single glance the simple and magnificent history of a man who was delivering himself up so that another man might not be condemned in his stead
the details the hesitation a little possible oppositions were swallowed up in that vs stand luminous fact
it was an impression which vanishes speedily but which was irresistible at the moment
i do not wish to disturb the court further resumed jean valjean
i shall withdraw since you do not arrest me
i have many things to do
the district attorney knows who i am he knows whither i am going he can have me arrested when he likes
he directed his steps towards the door
boys voice was raised not an arm extended to hinder him
all stood aside
at that moment there was about him that divine something which causes multitudes to stand aside and make way for a man
he traversed the crowd slowly
it was never known who opened the door but it is certain that he found the door open when he reached it
on arriving there he turned round and said i am at your command mr
district attorney
then he addressed the audience all of you all who are present consider me worthy of pity do you not
good god
when i think of what i was on the point of doing i consider that i am to be envied
nevertheless i should have preferred not to have had this occur
he withdrew and the door closed behind him as it had opened for those who do certain sovereign things are always sure is being served by someone in the crowd
less than an hour after this the verdict of the jury freed the said champ mathieu from all accusations and champ mathieu being at once released went off in a state of style faction thinking that all men were fools and comprehending nothing of this vision
book eighth
a counter blow chapter i. in what mirror m
madeleine contemplates his hair the day had begun to dawn
f anyone had passed a sleepless and feverish night filled with happy visions at daybreak she fell asleep
sisters implode who had been watching with her availed herself of this slumber to go and prepare a new option of chin china
the worthy sister had been in the laboratory of the infirmary but a few moments bending over her drugs and p goals and scrutinizing things very closely on account of the witness which the half light of dawn spreads over all objects
suddenly she raised her head and uttered a faint shriek
m
madeleine stood before her he had just entered silently
is it young
mayor
she exclaimed
he replied in a low voice how is that poor woman
not so bad just now but we have been very uneasy
she explained to him what had passed that can find had been very ill the day before and that she was better now because she thought that the mayor had gone to mint vermeil together child
the sister dared not question the mayor but she perceived plainly from h i said that he had not come from there
all that is good said he you were right not to un receive her
yes responded the sister but now mr
mayor she will see you and will not see her child
what shall we say to use
he reflected for a moment
god will inspire us said he
but we can not tell a lie murmured the sister half a loud
it was broad daylight in the room
the light fell full inn
madeleine's face
the sister chanced to raise her eyes to it
good god air
she exclaimed what has happened to you
your hair is perfectly white
white
said he
sisters implode had no mirror
she rummaged in a drawer and pulled out the little glass which the doctor of the infirmary used to see whether a patient was dead and whether he no longer breathed
m
madeleine took the mirror looked at his hair and said well
he uttered the word in differently and as though his mind were in something else
the sister felt chilled by something strange of which she caught a glimpse in all this
he inquired can i see her
is not monsieur le mal're going to have her child brought back to her
said the sister hardly venturing to put the question
of course but it will take two or three days at least
if she were not to see monsieur lemaire until that time went on the sister timidly she would not know that monsieur lemaire had returned and it would be easy to inspire her with patience and when the child arrived she would naturally think monsieur lemaire had just come with the child
we should not have to enact a lot
m
madeleine seemed to reflect for a few moments then he said with his calm gravity no soccer i must see her
i may perhaps be in haste
thehun did not appear to notice this word perhaps which communicated an obscure and singular sense to the words of the mayor's speech
she replied lowering her eyes and her voice respectfully in that case she is asleep but monsieur lemaire may enter
he made some remarks about a door which shut badly and the noise of which might awaken the sick woman then he entered can find's chamber approached the new and drew aside the curtains
she was asleep
her breath issued from her breast with that tragic sound which is peculiar to those maladies and which breaks the hearts of mothers when they are watching through the night beside their sleeping child who is condemned to death
but this painful respiration hardly troubled a sort of ineffable serenity which over spread her countenance and which transfigured her in her sleep
her pallor had become whiteness her cheeks were crimson her long golden lashes the only beauty of her youth and her virginity which remained to her pal pirated though they remained closed and drooping
her whole person was trembling with an indescribable unfolding of wings all ready to open wide and best her away which could be felt as they rustled though they could not be seen
to see her this one would never have dreamed that she was an invalid whose life was almost despaired of
she resembled rather something on the point of soaring away than something on the point of dying
the branch trembles when a hand approaches it to pluck a flower and seems to both withdraw and to offer itself at one and the same time
the human body has something of this tremor when the instant arrives in which the mysterious fingers of death are about to pluck the soul
m
madeleine remained for some time motionless beside that bed gazing in turn up on the sick woman and the crucifix as he had done two months before on the day when he had come for the first time to see her in that asylum
they were both still there in the same attitude she sleeping be praying only now after the lapse of two months her hair was gray and his was quite
the sister had not entered with him
he stood beside the bed with his finger on his lips as though there were someone in the chamber whom he must enjoin to silence
she opened her eyes saw him and said quietly with a smile and cosette
chapter o if anyone happy she made no movement of either dhfpr use or of joy she was not itself
that simple question and cosette
was out with so profound a faith with so much certainty with such a complete absence of disquiet and of doubt that he found not a word of reply
she continued i knew that you were there
i was asleep but i saw you
i have seen you for a long long time
i have been following you with my eyes all night long
you were in a glory and you had around you all sorts of celestial forms
he raised his glance to the crucifix
but she resumed tell me where cosette is
why did not you place her on my bet against the moment of my waking
he made some mechanical reply which he was never afterwards able to recall
fortunately the doctor had been warned and he now made his appearance
hed' amato the aid of m
madeleine
calm yourself my child said the doctor your child is here
can tune's eyes beamed and filled her whole face with light
she clasped her hands with an expression which contained all that is possible to prayer in the way of violence and tenderness
oh
she exclaimed bring her home
touching illusion of another
cosette was for her still the little child who is carried
not yet said the doctor not just now
you still have some fever
the sight of your child would agitate you and do you harm
you must be fired first
she interrupted him impetuously but i am cured
oh i tell you that i am cured
what an ass that doctor is
the idea
i want to see my child
you see said the doctor how excited you become
so long as you are in this starfish all oppose your having your child
it is not enough to see her it is necessary that you should live for her
when you are reasonable i will bring her to you myself
the poor mother bowed her head
i beg your pardon doctor i really get your pardon
formerly i should never have spoken as i have just done so many misfortunes have happened to me that i sometimes do not know what is'm saying
i understand you you fear the emotion
i will wait as long as you like but i swear to you that it would not have harmed me to see my daughter
i have been seeing her i have not taken my eyes from her since yesterday evening
do you know
if she were brought to me now i should talk to her very gently
that is all
is it not quite natural that i should desire to see my daughter who has been brought to me expressly from mont vermeil
i am not angry
i know well that i am about to be happy
all night long i have seen white things and persons who smiled at me
when monsieur le docteur please she shall bring me cosette
i have no longer any fever i am sell
i am perfectly conscious that there is nothing the matter with me anymore but i am going to behave as though i were ill and not stir to please these ladies here
when it is seen that i am very calm they will say' she must have her child
' m
madeleine was sitting on a chair beside the bed
she turned towards him she was making a visible effort to be calm and very good as she expressed it in the feebleness of illness which resembles infancy in order that seeing her so peaceable they might make no difficulty about bringing cosette toner
but while she controlled herself she could not refrain from questioning m
madeleine
did you have a pleasant trip monsieur lemaire
oh
how good you were to go and get her for me
only tell me how she is
did sheet and the journey well
alas
she will not recognize me
she must have forgotten me by this time poor darling
children have no memories
they are like birds
a child see something today and another thing tomorrow and thinks of nothing any longer
and did she have white linen
did those the barriers keep her clean
now have they fed her
oh
if you only knew how i have suffered putting such questions as that to myself during all the time of my wretchedness
now it is all past
i am happy
oh how i should like to see her
do you think her pretty monsieur lemaire
is not my daughter beautiful
you must have been very cold in that diligence
could she not be brought for just one little instant
she might be taken away directly afterwards
tell me you are the master it could be so if you chose
he took her hand
cosette is beautiful he said cosette is well
you shall see her soon but calm yourself you are talking with too much vivacity and you are throwing your arms out from under the clothes and that makes you cough
in fact fits of coughing interrupted fan time at nearly every word
fan time did not murmurs he feared that she had injured by her too passionate lamentations the confidence which she was desirous of inspiring and she began to talk of in different things
long vermeil is quite pretty if it not
people got here on pleasure parties in summer
are the the barriers prosperous
there are not many travellers in their parts
that inn of theirs is a sort of a cookshop
m
madeleine was still holding her hand and gazing at her with anxiety it was evident that he had come to tell her things before which his mind now hesitated
the doctor having finished his visit retired
sisters implode remained alone with them
but in the midst of this paused anti he exclaimed i hear her
mon dieu i hear her
she stretched out her arm to enjoin silence about her held her breath and began to listen with rapture
there was a child playing in the yard the child of the port fessor of some work woman
it was one of those accidents which are always occurring and which seem to form a part of the mysterious stage setting of mournful scenes
the child a little girl was going and coming running to warm herself laughing singing at the top of her voice
alas
in what are the plays of children not intermingled
it was this little girls home anyone heard singing
oh
she resumed it is my cosette
i recognize her voice
the child're treated as it had come the voice died away
fab time listened for awhile longer then her face clouded over and n
madeleine heard her way in a low voice how wicked that doctor is not to allow me to see my daughter
that man has an evil countenance that he has
but the smiling background of her thoughts came to the front again
she continues to talk to herself with her head resting on the pillow how happy we are going to be
we shall have a little garden the very first thing h
madeleine has promised it to me
my daughter will play in the garden
she must know her letters by this time
i will make her spell
she will run over the grass after butterflies
i will watch her
then she will take her first communion
ah
when will she take her first communion
she began to reckon on her fingers
one two three four she is seven years old
in five years she will have a white veil and open work stockings she will look like a little woman
o my good sister you do not know how foolish i become when i think of my daughter's first communion
she began to laugh
he had released can find's hand
he listened to her words as one listens to the signing of the breeze with his eyes on the ground his mind absorbed in reflection which had no bottom
all at once she ceased speaking and this caused him to raise his head mechanically
f anyone had become terrible
she no longer spokes be no longer breathed she had raised herself to a sitting posture her thin shoulder emerged from her chemise her face which had been radiant cut a moment before was ghastly and she seemed to have fixed her eyes rendered large with terror on something alarming at the other extremity of the room
good god
he exclaimed what ails you can find
she made no reply she did not remove her eyes from the object which she seemed to see
she removed one hand from his arm and with the other made him a sign to look behind him
he turned and be held javert
chapter ii on a very satisfied this is what had taken place
the half hour after midnight had just struck when m
madeleine skirted the hall of assizes in areas
he regained his inn justin time to set out again by the mail wagon in which he had engaged his place
a little before sixo'clock in the morning he had arrived at m
shrm
and his first care has been to post a letter to n
laffitte then to enter the infirmary and see fan time
however he had hardly quitted the audience hall of the court of assizes when the district attorney recovering from his first shock had taken the word to deplore the mad deed of the honorable mayor of m
shrm
to declare that his convictions had not been in the least modified by that curious incident which would be explained thereafter and to demand in the meantime the condemnation of that champ mathieu who was evidently the real jean valjean
the district attorney's persistence was visibly at variance with the sentiments of every one of the public of the court and of the jury
the counsel for the defence had some difficulty in refuting this harangue and in establishing that in consequence of the revelations of m
madeleine that is to say if the real jean valjean the aspect of the matter had been thoroughly altered and that the jury had before their eyes now only an innocent man
thence the lawyer had drawn some epiphone has not very fresh unfortunately upon judicial errors etc.
etc.
the president in his summing up had joined the counsel for the defence and in a few minutes the jury had thrown champ mathieu out of the case
nevertheless the district attorney was bent on having a jean valjean and as he had no longer stamp mathieu he took madeleine
immediately after champ mathieu had been set at liberty the district attorney shut himself up with the president
they conferred as to the necessity of seizing the person of m
lemaire of m
shrm
this phrase in which there was a great deal of it is the district attorney's written with his own hand on the minutes of his report to the attorney general
his first emotion having passed off the president did not offer many objections
justice must after all take its course
and then when all was said although the president was soundly and a tolerably intelligent man he was at the same time a devoted and almost an ardent royalist and he had been shocked to hear the mayor of m
shrm
say the emperor and not bonaparte when alluding to the landing at cannes
the order for his arrest was accordingly despatched
the district attorney forwarded it tom
shrm
by a special messenger at full speed and entrusted its execution to police inspector javert
the reader knows that is very has returned to m
surg
immediately after having given his deposition
javert was just getting out of bed when the messenger handed him the order of arrest and the command to produce the prisoner
the messenger himself was a very clever member of the police who in two words informed javert of what had taken place at areas
the order of arrest signed by the district attorney was couched in these words inspector javert will apprehend the body of the sieur madeleine mayor of m
shrm
who in this day's session of the court was recognized as the liberated convict jean valjean
anyone who did not know javert and who had chances to see him at the moment when he penetrated the antechamber of the infirmary could have divined nothing of what had taken place and would have thought h i said the most ordinary in the world
he was cool calm grave his gray hair was perfectly smooth upon his temples and he had just mounted the stairs with his habitual deliberation
anyone who was thoroughly acquainted with him and who had examined him attentively at the moment would have shuddered
the buckle of his leather stock was under his left ear instead of at the nape of his neck
this betrayed unwonted agitation
kavery was a complete character who never had a wrinkle in his duty or in his uniform methodical with malefactors rigid with the buttons of his coat
that he should have set the buckle of his stocks set it was indispensable that there should have taken place in him one of those emotions which may be designated as internal earthquakes
he had come in a simple way had made a requisition on the neighboring post for a corporal and four soldiers had left the soldiers in the courtyard had made anyone's room pointed out to him by the port read who was utterly in suspicious accustomed as she was to seeing armed men inquiring for the mayor
on arriving at bantine's chamber javert turned the handle pushed the door open with the gentleness of a sick nurse or a police spy and entered
properly speaking he did not enter
he stood erect in the half open door to stay on his head and his left hand thrust into his coat which was buttoned up to the chin
in the bend of his elbow the leaden head of his enormous came which was hidden behind him could be seen
thus he remained for nearly a minute without his presence being perceived
all at once fan time raised her eyes saw him and made m
madeleine turn round
the instant that madeleine's glance encountered javert's glance javert without stirring without moving from his post without approaching him became terrible
no human sentiment can be as terrible as joy
it was the visage of a demon who has just found his damned soul
the satisfaction of at last getting hold of jean valjean caused all that was in his soul to appear in his countenance
the depths having been stirred up mounted to the surface
the humiliation of having in some slight degree lost the scent and of having indulged for a few moments in an error with regard to champ mathieu eased faced by price at having so well and accurately divined in the first place and of having for so long cherished a just instinct
javert's content shone forth in his sovereign attitude
the deformity of triumph over spread that narrow brow
all the demonstrations of horror which a satisfies face can afford were there
javert was in heaven at that moment
without putting the thing clearly to himself but with a confused intuition of the necessity of his presence and of his success he is very personified justice light and truth in their celestial function of crushing out evil
behind him and around him at an infinite distance he had authority reason the case judged the legal conscience the public prosecution all the stars he was protecting order he was causing the last i yield up its thunder she was avenging society he was lending a helping hand to the absolute he was standing erect in the midst of a glory
there existed in his victory a remnant of defiance and of combat
erect naughty brilliant he flaunted abroad in open day the superhuman bestiality of a ferocious archangel
the terrible shadow of the action which he was accomplishing caused the vague flash of the social sword to be visible in his clenched fist happy and indignant he held his heel upon crime vice rebellion perdition hell he was radiant me exterminate the smiled and there was an incontestable grandeur in this monstrous saint michael
javert though frightful had nothing ignoble about him
probity since but i can for combustion the sense of duty are things which may become hideous when wrongly directed but which even when hideous remain grand their majesty the majesty peculiar to the human conscience clings to them in the midst of horror they are virtues which have one vice error
the honest pitiless lot of a fanatic in the full flood of his atrocity preserves a certain lugubrious it venerable radiance
without himself suspecting the fact javert in his formidable happiness was to be pitied aside very ignorant man who triumphs
nothing could be so poignant and so terrible as this case wherein was displayed all that may be designated as the evil of the good
chapter iv authority reassert site rights fan time had not seen javert since the day on which the mayor had to enter from the man
her ailing brain comprehended nothing but the only thing which she did not doubt was that he had come together
she could not ensure that terrible face she felt her life quiet on there he hid her face in both hands and shrieked in her anguish monsieur madeleine save me
jean valjean we shall henceforth not speak of him otherwise had risen
he said tocantins in the gentlest and calmest it voices be at ease it is not for you that he is some
then he addressed javert and said i know what you want
naveen replied be quick about it
the delay in the inflection of voices bush accompanied these words something indescribably fierce and frenzied
javert did not say he quick about it
he said beat is no kit
no orthography can do justice to the accent with which it was uttered it was no longer a human word it was a road
he did not proceed according to his custom he did not enter into the matter he exhibited no warrant of arrest
in his eyes jean valjean was a sort of mysterio us combatant who was not to be laid hands upon a wrestler in the dark whom he had had in his grasp for the last five years without being able to throw him
this arrest was not a beginning but an end
he confined himself to saying be quick about it
as he spoke thus he did not advance a single step he hurled at jean valjean a glance which he threw out like a grappling hook and with which he was accustomed to draw wretches violently to him
it was this glance which can find had felt penetrating to the very narrow of her bones two months previously
at javert's exclamation fan time opened her eyes once more
but the mayor was there what had she to fear
javert advanced to the middle of the room and cried see here now
art thou coming
the unhappy woman glanced about her
no one was present excepting the gun and the mayor
to whom would that abject use of thou be addressed
to her only
she shuddered
then she beheld a most unprecedented things things i unprecedented that nothing equal to it had appeared to her even in the blackest delirium's of fever
she beheld javert the police spy seize the mayor by the dollar she saw the mayor how his head
it seemed to her that the world was coming to amend
javert had in fact grasped jean valjean by the collar
monsieur lemaire
shrieked fan time
javert burst out laughing with that frightful laugh which displayed all his gums
there is no longer any monsieur lemaire here
jean valjean made no attempt to disengage the hand which grasped the collar of his coat
he said javert javert interrupted him call me md
inspector
monsieur said jean valjean i should like to say a word to you in private
a loud
say it aloud
replies javert people are in the habit of talking aloud to me
jean valjean went on in a lower tone i have a request to make of john tell you to speak loud
but you alone should hear it what difference does that make home
i shall not listen
jean valjean turned towards him and said very rapidly and in a very low voice grant me three days' grace
three days in which to go and fetch the child of this unhappy woman
i will pay whatever is necessary
you shall accompany me if you choose
you are making sport of me
cried javert
come now i did not think you such a fool
you ask me to give you three days in which to run away
you say that it is for the purpose of fetching that creature's child
ah
ah
that's good
that's really capital
fan time was seized with a bit of trembling
my child
she cried to go and fetch my child
she is not here then
answer me sister where is cosette
i want my child
monsieur madeleine
monsieur lemaire
javert stamped his foot
and now there's the other one
will you hold your tongue you hussy
it'sa pretty sort of a place where convicts are magistrates and where women of the town are cared for like countess es
ah
but we are going to change all that it is high time
he stared intently at fan time and added once more taking into his grasp jean valjean's cravat shirt and collar i tell you that there is no monsieur madeleine and that there is to monsieur lemaire
there is a thief and uganda convict named jean valjean
and i hate him in my grasp
that's what there is
fan time raised herself in bed with a bound supporting herself on her stiffened arms and on both hands she gazed at jean valjean she gazed at javert she gazed at the nuns he opened her mouth as though to speak a rattle proceeded from the depths of her throat her teeth shattered she stretched out her arms in her agony opening her hands convulsively and fumbling about her like a drowning person then suddenly fell back on her pillow
her head struck the headboard of the bed and fell forwards on her breast with gaping mouth and sharing sight lease has
she was dead
jean valjean laid his hand upon the detaining hand of javert and opened it as he would have opened the hand of a baby then he said to javert you have murdered that woman
let's have an end of this
shouted javert in a fury i am not here to listen to argument
let us economize all that the guard is below march in instantly or you'll get the thumb screws
in the corner of the room stood an old iron bedstead which was in a decidedly decrepit state and which served the sisters as a camp bed when they were watching with the sick
jean valjean stepped up to this bed in a twinkling wrenched off the head piece which was already in a dilapidated condition an easy matter to muscles like his grasped the principal to'd like a bludgeon and glanced at javert
javert retreated towards the door
jean valjean armed with his bar of iron walked slowly up for anyone's couch
when he arrived there he turned and said to javert in a voice that was barely audible i advise you not to disturb me at this moment
one thing is certain and that is that is very trembled
it did occur to him to summon the guard but jean valjean might avail himself of that moment to effect his escape some remained grasped his fame by the small end and leaned against the door post without removing his eyes from jean valjean
jean valjean rested his elbow on the knob at the head of the bed and his brow on his hand and began to contemplate the motionless body of bantine which lay extended there
he remained this mute absorbed evidently with no further thought of anything connected with this life
upon his face and in his attitude there was nothing but inexpressible pity
after a few moments of this meditation he bent towards fan time and spoke to her in a low voice
what did he say to her
what could this man who was deprived way to that woman who was dead
what words were those
no one on earth heard them
did the dead woman hear them
there are some touching illusions which are perhaps sublime realities
the point as to which there exists no doubt is that sisters implode the sole witness of the incident often said that at the moment that jean valjean whispered infant one's ears be distinctly be held an ineffable smile dawn on those pale lips and in those dim eyes filled with the amazement of the tomb
jean valjean too if anyone's head in both his hands and arranged it on the pillows's another might have done for her child then he tied the string of her chemise and smoothed her hair back under her cap
that done be closed her eyes
f anyone's face seemed strangely illuminated at that moment
death that signifies entrance into the great light
f anyone's hand was hanging over the side of the bed
jean valjean knelt down before that hand lifted it gently and kissed it
then he rose and turned to javert
now said he i am at your disposal
chapter fa suitable tomb javert deposited jean valjean in the city prison
the arrest of m
madeleine occasioned a sensation or rather an extraordinary commotion in m
chem
we are sorry that we can not conceal the fact that at the single word he was a convict nearly everyone deserted him
in less than two hours all the good that he had done had been forgotten and he was nothing but a convict from the galleys
it is just to add that the details of what had taken place at areas were not yet known
all day long conversations like the following were to be heard in all quarters of the town youdon''t know
he was a liberated convict
who
the mayor
bah
m
madeleine
yes
really
his name was not madeleine at all he had a frightful name be jean home annoy jean
ah
good god
he has been arrested
arrested
in prison in the city prison while waiting to be transferred
until he is transferred
he is to be transferred
where is me to be taken
he will be tried at the assizes for a highway robbery which he committed long ago
well
i suspected as much
that man was too good too perfect too affected
he refused the cross he bestowed sous on all the little scamp she came across
i always thought there was some evil history back of all that
the drawing rooms particularly abounded in remarks of this nature
one old lady a subscriber to the drapeau blanc made the following remark the depth of which it is impossible to fathom i am not worry
it will be a lesson to the bona p artists
it was thus that the phantom which had been called m
madeleine vanished from m
shrm
only three or four persons in all the town remained faithful to his memory
the old port read who had served him was among the number
on the evening of that day the worthy old woman was sitting in her lodge still in a thorough bright and absorbed in sad reflections
the factory had been closed all day the carriage gate was bolted the street was deserted
there was no one in the house but the two guns sister perpetua and sisters implode who were watching beside the body of fan home
towards the hour when m
madeleine was accustomed to return home the good port red cross mechanically took from a drawer the key of m
madeleine's chamber and the flat candlestick which he used every evening to go up to his quarters then she hung the key on the nail whence he was accustomed to take it and set the candlestick on one side as though she was expecting him
then she sat down again on her chair and became absorbed in thought once more
the poor good old woman had done all this without being conscious of it
it was only at the expiration of two hours that she roused herself from here every and exclaimed hold
my good god jesus
and i hung his key on the nail
at that moment the small window in the lodge opened a hand passed through seizes the key and the candlestick and lighted the taper at the candle which was burning there
the port read raised her eyes and stood there with gaping mouth and a shriek which she confined to her throat
she knew that hand that arm the sleeve of that cost
it was m.
madeleine
it was several seconds before she could speak she had a seizure as she said herself when she relates the adventure afterwards
good for monsieur lemaire she cried at last i thought you were she stopped the conclusion of her sentence would have been lacking in respect towards the beginning
jean valjean was still monsieur lemaire to her
he finished her thought
in prison said he
i was there i broke a bar of one of the window coley myself drop from the top of a roof and here i am
i am going up to my room go and find sisters implode for me
she is with that poor woman no doubt
the old woman obeyed in all haste
he gave her no order she was quite sure that she would guard him better than he should guard himself
no one ever found out how he had managed to get into the courtyard without opening the big gates
he had and always carried about mi map as a key which opened a little side door but he must have been searched and his latchkey must have been taken from him
this point was never explained
he ascended the staircase leading to his chamber
on arriving at the top be left his candle on the top step of his stairs opened his door with very little noise went and closed his window and his shutters by feeling then returned for his candle and re entered his room
it was a useful precaution it will be recollected that his window could be seen from the street
he cast a glance about time this table at his chair at his bed which had not been disturbed for three days
no trace of the disorder of the night before last remained
the port read had done up his room only she had picked out of the ashes and placed neatly on the table the two iron ends of the cudgel and the forty so i piece which had been blackened by the fire
he took a sheet of paper on which he wrote these are the two tips of my iron show cudgel and the forty slu piece stolen from little gervais which i mentioned at the court of as sizes and he arranged this piece of paper the bits of iron and the coin in such a way that they were the first things to be seen on entering the room
from a cupboard he pulled out one of his old shirts which he tore in pieces
in the strips of linen thus prepared he wrapped the two silver candlesticks
he betrayed neither has ten or agitation and while he was wrapping up the bishop's candlestick she nibbled at a piece of black bread
it was probably the prison bread which he had carried with him in his flight
this was proved by the crumbs which were found on the floor of the room when the authorities made an examination later on
there came two taps at the door
come in said he
it was sisters implode
she was pale her eyes were fed the candle which she carried trembled in her hand
the peculiar feature of the violence's of destiny is that however polished or cooled maybe they aging human nature from our very bowels and forfeit to reappear on the surface
the emotions of that day had turned the gun into a woman once more
she had dept and she was trembling
jean valjean had just finished writing a few lines on a paper which he handed to the gun saying sister you will give this to monsieur le cure
the paper was not folded
she cast a glance upon it
you can read it said he
whereas i beg monsieur le sure to keep an eye on all that i leave behind me
he will be so good as to pay out of it the expenses of my trial and of the funeral of the woman who died yesterday
the rest is for the poor
the sister tried to speak but she only managed to stammer a few inarticulate sounds
she succeeded in saying however does not monsieur lemaire desire to take a last look at that poor unhappy woman
no. said he jan pursued it would only end in their arresting me in that room and that would disturb her
he had hardly finished when a loud noise became audible in the staircase
they heard a tumult of ascending footsteps and the old pierre as saying in her loudest and most piercing tones my good sir i swear to you by the good god that not a soul has entered this house all day npr all the evening and that i have not even left the door
a man responded but there is a light in that room nevertheless
they recognized javert's voice
the chamber was so arranged that the door in opening masked the corner of the wall on the right
jean valjean blew out the light and placed himself in this angle
sister skip life fell on her knees near the table
the door opened
javert entered
the whispers of many men and the protestations of the pit trees were audible in the corridor
thehun did not raise her eyes
she was praying
the candle wax on the chimney piece and gave but very little light
javert caught sight of the jun and halted in amazement
it will be remembered that the fundamental point in jager this element the very air he breathed was veneration for all authority
this was impregnable and admitted if neither objection not restriction
in his eyes of course the ecclesiastical authority was the chief of all he was religious superficial and correct on this point as on all others
in his eyes a priest was a mind who never makes a mistake an un was a creature who never sins they were souls walked in from this works with a single door which never opened except to allow the truth to pass through
on perceiving the sister his first movement was to retire
but there was also another duty which bound him am compelled him imperiously in the opposite direction
his second movement was to remain and to venture on at least one question
this was sisters implode who had never told a lie in her life
javert knew it and held her in special generation in consequence
sister said he are you alone in this room
a terrible moment ensued during which the poor port read felt as though she should faint
the sister raised her eyes and answered yes
then resumed javert you will excuse me if i persist it is my duty you have not seen a certain persons man this evening
he has escaped we are in search of him that jean valjean you have not seen him
the sister replied no
she lied
she had lied twice in succession one after the other without hesitation promptly as a person does when sacrificing herself
pardon me said javert and he retired with a deep now
o sainted maid
you left this world many years ago you have rejoined your sister's the virgins and four brothers the angels in the light may this lie be counted to your credit in paradise
the sister's affirmation was form a very so decisive a thing that he did not even observe the singularity of that candle which had but just been extinguished and which was still smoking on the table
an hour later a man marching amid trees and mists was rapidly departing from m
shrm
in the direction of paris
that man was jean valjean
it has been established by the new him on kody do or three carter's who met him that he was carrying a bundle that he was dressed in a blouse
where had he obtained that blouse
no one ever found out
but an area workman had died in the infirmary of the factory a few days before leaving behind him nothing but his blouse
perhaps that was the one
one last word about fan time
we all have a mother the earth
fan time was given back to that mother
the cure thought that he was doing right and perhaps he really was in're serving as much money as possible from what jean valjean had left for the poor
who was concerned after all
a convict and a woman of the town
that is why he had a very simple funeral for fan time and reduced it to that strictly necessary form known as the pauper's grave
so fan time was buried in the free corner of the cemetery which belongs to anybody and everybody and where the poor are lost
fortunately god knows where to find the soul again
fan time was laid in the shade among the first bones that came to hand she was subjected to the promiscuous ness of ashes
she was thrown into the public grave
her grave resembled her bed

waterloo chapter i. what is met within the way from micelles last year on a beautiful may morning a traveller the person who is telling this story was coming from micelles and directing his course towards la tulle
he was on foot
he was pursuing a broad paved road which undulated between two rows of trees over the bills which succeed each other raise the road and let it fall again and produce something in the nature of enormous waves
he had passed lil lois and food seigneur isaac
in the west he perceived the slate roof ed tower of brainsl' all eur which has the form of a reversed vase
he had just left behind a wood upon an eminence and at the angle of the crossroad by the side of a sort of mouldy gibbet bearing the inscription ancient barrier to
a public house bearing on its front this sign at the four winds aux what revenge
e chan way private cafe
a quarter of a league further if he arrived at the bottom of a little valley where there is water which passes beneath an arch made through the embankment of the road
the clump of sparsely planted but very green trees which fills the valley on one side of the road is dispersed over the meadows on the other and disappears gracefully and as in order in the direction of brainsl' all eur
on the right close to the road was an inn with a four wheeler cart at the door a large bundle of hippo less plough a heap of dried brushwood near a flourishing hedge like smoking in a square hole and a ladder suspended along's gold penthouse with straw partitions
a young girl was wedding in a field where a huge yellow poster probably of some outside spectacle such as a parish festival was fluttering in the wind
at one corner of the inn beside a pool in which a flotilla of ducks was navigating a badly paved path plunged into the bushes
the wayfarer's truck into this
after traversing a hundred paces skirting a wall of the fifteenth century surmounted by a pointed table with bricks set in contrast he found himself before a large door of arched stone with a rectilinear i'm lost in the sombre style of louis xiv
flanked by two flat medallions
a severe facade rose above this doors wall perpendicular to the facade almost touched the door and flanked it with an abrupt right angle
in the meadow before the door lay three harrows through which in disorder grew all the flowers of may
the door was closed
the two decrepit leaves which barred it were ornamented with an old rusty knocker
the sun was charming the branches had that sort shivering of may which seems to proceed rather from the nests than from the wind
a brave little bird probably a lover was ca rolling in a distracted manner in a large tree
the wayfarer bent over and examined a rather large circular excavation resembling the hollow of a sphere in the stone on the left at the foot of the pier of the door
at this moment the leaves of the door parted and a peasant woman emerged
she saw the wayfarer and perceived what he was looking at
it was a french cannonball which made that she said to him
and she added that which you see there higher up in the door near a nail is the hole of a big iron bullet as large as an egg
the bullet did not pierce the wood
what is the name of this place
inquirer the wayfarer
you go mont said the peasant woman
the traveller straightened himself up
he walked on a few paces and went off to look over the tops of the hedges
on the horizon through the trees he perceived a sort of little elevation and on this elevation something which at that distance resembled a lion
he was on the battlefield of waterloo
chapter ii you go monthly go mont this was a funereal spot the beginning of the obstacle the first resistance which that great woodcutter of europe called napoleon encountered at waterloo the first knot under the blows of his axe
it was a chateau it is no longer anything but a farm
for the antiquary you go mont is hugo none
this manor was built by hugo side of some rel the same who endowed the sixth chaplaincy of the abbey of villiers
the traveller pushed open the door elbowed an ancient ca last under the pitch and entered the courtyard
the first thing which struck him in this paddock was a door of the sixteenth century which here simulates an arcade everything else having fallen prostrate around it
a monumental aspect often has its birth in ruin
in a wall near the arcade opens another arched door of the time of henry iv
permitting a glimpse of the trees of an orchard beside this doors manure hole some pickaxe's some shovels some carts an old well with its flagstone and its iron feel a chicken jumping and a turkey spreading its tail a chapel surmounted by a small bell tower a blossoming pear tree trained in espa life against the wall of the chapel behold the court the conquest of which was one of napoleon's dreams
this corner of earth could be but have seized it would perhaps have given him the world likewise
chickens are scattering its dust abroad with their beaks
a growl is audible it is a huge dog who shows his teeth and replaces the english
the english behaved admirably there
cooke's four companies of guards there held out for seven hours against the fury of an army
you go mont viewed on the napa ca geometrical plan comprising buildings and enclosures presents a sort of irregular rectangle in tangle of which is nicked out
it is this angle which contains the southern door guarded by this wall which commands it only a gun's length away
you go month as two doors the southern door that of the chateau and the northern door belonging to the dark
napoleon sent his brother jerome against you go mont the division softly guillemin it and bach flu hurled themselves against it nearly the entire corps of grille was employed against it and miscarried kellermann's balls were exhausted on this heroic section of wall
baud jim's brigade was not strong enough to force no ufo mont on the north and the brigade of skye could not do more than effect the beginning of a breach on the south but without taking it
the farm buildings border the courtyard on the south
a bit of the north door broken by the french hangs suspended to the wall
it consists of four plan is mailed to two cross beams on which the scars of the attack are visible
the northern door which was beaten in by the french and which has had a piece applied to it to replace the panel suspended on the wall stands half open at the bottom of the paddock it is cut squarely in the wall built of stone below of brick above which closes in the courtyard of the north
it is a simple door for carts such as exist in all farms with the two large leaves made of rustic plan is beyond lie the meadows
the dispute over this entrance was furious
for a long time all sorts of imprints of bloody hands were visible on the door posts
it was there that bahru it was killed
the storm of the combat still lingers in this courtyard its horror is visible there the confusion of the fray was petrified there it lives and it dies there it was only yesterday
the walls are in the deaths font the stones call the breaches cry aloud the holes are wounds the drooping quivering trees seem to be making an effort to flee
this courtyard was more built upon than it is today
buildings which have since been pulled down then formed texans and angles
the english barricaded themselves there the french made their way in. but could not stand their ground
beside the chapel one wing of the chateau the only ruin now remaining of the manor of you go mont rises in a crumbling state did embo seller one might say
the chateau served for a dungeon the chapel for a block house
there men exterminated each other
the french boredom from every point from behind the walls from the summits of the targets from the depths of the cellars through all the casements through all the air holes through every crack in the stones fetched favors and set fire to walls and jen the reply to the grapes hot was a conflagration
in the ruined wing through windows garnished with bars of iron thesis mangled chambers of the main building of brick are visible the english guards were inch bush in these rooms the spiral of the staircase cracked from the ground floor to the very roof appears like the inside or a broken shell
the staircase has two stories the english besieged on the staircase and massed in its upper steps had cut off the lower steps
these consisted of large slabs of blue stone which form a heap among the nettles
half a score of steps still cling to the wall on the first is but the figure of a trident
these inaccessible steps are solid in their niches
all the rest resembles a jaw which has been denuded of its teeth
there are two old trees there one is dead the other is wounded at its base and is clothed with verdure in april
since it has taken to growing through the staircase
a massacre took place in the chapel
the interior which has recovered its calm is singular
the mass has not been said there since the carnage
nevertheless the altar has been left there an altar of unpolished wood placed against a background of rough teen stone
four whitewashed walls w door opposite the altar two small arched windows over the door a large wooden crucifix below the crucifix a square air holes topped up with a bundle of hay on the ground in one corner an old window frame with the glass all broken to pieces such is the chapel
near the altar there is hauled up a wooden statue of saint anne of the fifteenth century the head of the infant jesus has been carried off by a large ball
the french who were masters of the chapel for a moment and were then dislodged set fire to it
the flames filled this building it was a perfect furnace the door was burned the floor was burned the wooden christ was not burned
the fire preyed upon his feet of which only the blackened stumps are now to be seen then it stopped a miracle according to the asset tion of the people of the neighborhood
the infant jesus decapitated was less fortunate than the christ
the walls are covered with inscriptions
near the feet of christ this name is to be read benq hines
then these others conde de rio major marques that que sa de almagro habana
there are french names with exclamation points a sign of wrath
the wall was freshly white washed in
the nation's insulted each other there
it was at the door of this chapel that the corpse was picked up which held an axe in its hand this corpse was sub lieutenant legros
on emerging from the chapel a well is visible on the left
there are two in this courtyard
one inquires why is there no bucket and pulley to this
it is because water is no longer drawn there
why is water not drawn there
because it is full of skeletons
the last person who drew water from the well was named guillaume can kyle pm
he was a peasant who lived at you go mont and was gardener there
ont meth of june his family fled and concealed themselves in the woods
the forest surrounding the abbey of villiers sheltered these unfortunate people who had been scattered abroad for many days and nights
there are at this day certain traces recognizable such as old files of burned trees which mark the site of these poor bivouac's trembling in the depths of the thickets
guillaume van it is on remained at you go mo mt to guard the chateau and concealed himself in the cellar
the english discovered him there
they tore him from his hiding place and the combatants forced this frightened man to serve them by administering blows with the flats of their swords
they were thirsty this guillaume brought them water
it was from this well that he credit
many drank there their last draught
this well where drank so many of the dead was destined to die itself
after the engagement they were in haste to bury the dead bodies
death has a fashion of harassing victory and she causes the pest to follow glory
the typhus is a concomitant of triumph
this well was deep and it was turned into a sepulchre
three hundred dead bodies were cast into it
with too much haste perhaps
were they all dead
legend says they were not
it seems that on the night succeeding the interment feeble voices were heard calling from the well
this well is isolated in the middle of the courtyard
three walls part stone part brick and simulating a small square tower and folded like the leaves of a screen surround it on all sides
the fourth side us open
it is there that the water was drawn
the wall at the bottom has a sort of shapeless loophole possibly the hole made by a shell
this little tower had a platform of which only the beams remain
the iron supports of the well on the right for macross
on leaning over the eye is lost in a deep cylinder of brick which is filled with a heaped up mass of shadows
the base of the walls all about the well is concealed in a growth of nettles
this sell has not in front of it that large blue flag which forms the table for all wells in belgium
the slab has here been replaced by across beam against which is an five or six shapeless fragments of knotty and petrified wood which resemble huge bones
there is no longer either paul chain or pulley but there is still the stone basin which served the overflow
the rain water collects there and from time to time a bird of the neighboring forests comes thither to drink and then flies away
one house in this ruin the farmhouse is still inhabited
the door of this house opens on the courtyard
upon this door beside a pretty gothic lock plate there is an iron handle with tre tools placed slanting
at the moment when the hanoverian lieutenant wilda grasped this handle in order to take refuge in the farm a french sapper heard off his hand with an axe
the family who occupy the house had for their grandfather guillaume can kyle on the old gardener dead long since
a woman with gray hair said to us i was there
i was three years old
my sister who was older was terrified and wept
they carried us off to the woods
i went there in my mother's arms
we glued our ears to the earth to hear
i imitated the cannon and went blum
blum
a door opening from the courtyard on the left led into the orchard so we were told
the orchard is terrible
it is in three parts one might almost say in three acts
the first part is a garden the second is an orchard the third is a wood
these three parts have a common enclosure on the side of the entrance the buildings of the chateau and the farm on the left a hedge on the rights wall and at the end a wall
the wall on the right is it brick the wall at the bottom is of stone
one enters the garden first
it slopes downwards is planted with gooseberry fishes choked with a wild growth of vegetation and terminated by a monumental terrace of cut stone with balustrade with a double curve
it was assignor isl garden in the first french style which preceded of notre today it is ruins and briars
the pilasters are surmounted by globes which resemble cannon balls of stone
forty three balusters can still be counted on their sockets the rest lie prostrate in the grass
almost all bear scratches of bullets
one broken baluster is placed on the pediment like a fractured leg
it was in this garden further down than the orchard that six light infantry men of the st. having made their way thither and being unable to escape hunted down and caught like bears in their dens accepted the combat with two hanoverian companies one of which was armed with carbines
the hanoverian's lined this balustrade and fired from above
the infantrymen replying from below six against two hundred intrepid and with no z helter save the currant bushes took a quarter of an hour to die
one mounts a few steps and passes from the garden into the orchard properly speaking
there within the limits of those few square fathoms fifteen hundred men fell in less than an hour
the wall seems ready to renew the combat
thirty eight loopholes pierced by the english at irregular heights are there still
in front of the sixth are placed two english tombs of granite
there are loopholes only in the south wall as the principal attack came from that quarter
the wall is hidden on the outside by at all hedge the french came up thinking that they had to deal only with a hedge crossed it and found the wall both an obstacle and a nambucca re with the english guards behind it the thirty eight loopholes firing at once a shower of grapes hot and balls and so he's brigade was broken against it
this waterloo began
nevertheless the orchard was taken
as they had no ladders the french scaled it with their nails
they fought hand to hand amid the trees
all this grass has been soaked in blood
a battalion of nassau seven hundred strong was over whelmed there
the outside of the wall against which kellermann's two batteries were trained is thawed by grapes hot
this orchard is sentient like others in the ninth of may
it has its butter cups and its daisies the grass is tall there the cart horses browse the records of fair in which linen is drying traverse the spaces between the trees and force the passerby to bend his head one walks over this in cultivated land and one's blog dives into hole holes
in the middle of the grass one observes an up rooted tree hole which lies there all verdant
major black mann leaned against it to die
beneath a great tree in the neighborhood tell the german general dull at descended from a french family which flew on the revocation of the edict of nantes
an aged and falling apple tree of an star over to one side its sound dressed with a bandage of straw and of clayey loan
nearly all the apple trees are falling with age
there is not one which has not had its bullet or its biscay an
the skeletons of dead trees abound in this orchard
cross fly through their branches and at the end of it is a wood full of violets
baidu in killed boy wounded conflagration massacre carnage a rivulet formed of english blood french blood german blood mingled in fury a well crammed with corpses the regiment of nassau and the regiment of brunswick destroyed dull at killed black mann killed the english guards mutilated twenty french battalions besides the forty from grille's corps decimated three thou same men in that novel of you to mont along cut down slashed to pieces shot burned with their throats cut and all this so that a peasant can say today to the traveller monsieur give me three france and if you like i will explain to you the affair of waterloo
chapter iii the eighteenth of june let us turn back that is one of the storyteller's rights and put ourselves once more in the year and even a little earlier than the epoch when the action narrated in the first part of this book took place
if it had no trained in the night between the th and the thorny be the fate of europe would have been different
a few drops of water more or less decided the downfall of napoleon
all that providence required in order to make waterloo the end of austerlitz was a little more rain and a cloud traversing the sky out of season sufficed to make a world crumble
the battle of waterloo could not be begin until half past eleveno'clock and that have blucher time to come up
why
because the ground was set
the artillery had to wait until it became a little corner before they could manoeuvre
napoleon was an artillery officer and felt the effects of this
the foundation of this wonderful captain was the man who in the report to the directory on a book of said such a one of our balls killed six men
all his plans of battle were arranged for projectiles
the key to his victory was to make the artillery converge on one point
he treated the strategy of the hostile general like a citadel and have a breach in it
he overwhelmed the weak point with grapes to the joined and dissolved battles with cannon
there was something of the sharp shooter in his genius
to beat in squares to pulverize regiments to break lines to crush and disperse masses for him everything lay in this to strike strike strike incessantly and he intrusted this task to the cannonball
a redoubtable method and one which unites with genius rendered this gloomy athlete of the punk liam of war invincible for the space of fifteen years
ont meth of june be relied all the more on his artillery because he had numbers on his side
wellington had only one hundred and fifty nine mouths of fire napoleon had two hundred and forty
suppose the soil dry and the artillery capable of moving the action would have begun at sixo'clock in the morning
the battle would have been won and ended at twoo'clock three hours before the change of fortune in favor of the prussians
what amount of blame attaches to napoleon for the loss of this battle
is the shipwreck due to the pilot
was it the evident physical decline of napoleon that complicated this epoch by an inward diminution of force
had the twenty years of war worn out the blade as it had worn the scabbard the soul as well as the body
did the veteran make himself disastrously felt in the leader
in a word was this genius as many historians of note have thought suffering from an eclipse
did he go into a frenzy in order to disguise his weakened powers from himself
did he begin to waver under the delusion of a breath of adventure
had he become a grave matter in a general unconscious of peril
is there an age in this class of material great men who may be called the giants of action when genius grows shortsighted
old age has to hold on the geniuses of the ideal for the dante's and michaelangelo's to grow old is to grow in greatness is it to grow less for the hannibal's and the bonaparte's
had napoleon lost the direct sense of victory
had he reached the point where he could no longer recognize the reef could no longer divine the snare no longer discern the crumbling brink of abysses
had he lost his power of scenting out catastrophes
he who had informed days known all the roads to triumph and who from the summit of his chariot of lightning pointed them out with a sovereign finger had he now reached that state of sinister amazement when he could lead his tumultuous legions harnessed to it to the precipice
was he seized at the age of forty six with a supreme madness
was that titanic charioteer of destiny no longer anything more than an immense daredevil
we do not think so
his plan of battle was by the confession of all a masterpiece
to go straight to the centre of the allies' line to make a breach of the enemy to cut them in two to drive the british half back on hcl and the prussian half ont ont des to make two shattered fragments of wellington and blucher to carry mont saint jean to seize brussels to hurl the german into the rhine and the englishman into the sea
all this was contained in that battle according to napoleon
afterwards people would see
of course we do not here pretend to furnish a history of the battle of waterloo one of the scenes of the foundation of the story which we are relating is connected with this battle but this history is not our subject this history moreover has been finished and finished in a masterly manner from one point of view by napoleon and from another point of view by a whole o leiaf of historians
as for us we leave the historians at loggerheads we are but a distant witness a passerby on the plains seeker bending over that skip all made of human flesh taking appearances for realities perchance we have no right to oppose in the name of sciences collection of facts which contain illusions no doubt we possess neither military practice nor strategic ability which authorizes system in our opinions chain of accidents dominated the two leaders at waterloo and when it becomes a question of destiny that mysterious culprit we judge like that ingenious judge the populace
chapter iva those persons who wish to gain a clear idea of the battle of waterloo have only to place mentally on the grounds capitals
the left limb of the ais the road to give lots the right limb is the road to be nappe the tie of the ais the hollow road too gain from brainsl' all eur
the top of the ais mont saint jean where wellington is the lower left topic you go mont where we ille is stationed with jerome bonaparte the right tip is the belle alliance where napoleon was
at the centre of this chord is the precise point where the final word of the battle was pronounced
it was there that the lion has been placed the involuntary symbol of the supreme heroism of the imperial guard
the triangle included in the top of the x between the two limbs and the tie is the plateau of mont saint jean
the dispute over this plateau constituted the whole battle
the wings of the two armies extended to the right and left of the two roads to be vapor and novel less's room facing pic to braille facing hill
behind the top of the a behind the plateau of mont saint jean is the forest of so if yes
as for the plain itself let the reader picture to himself a vast undulating sweep of ground each rise commands the next rise and all the undulations mount towards mont saint jean and there end in the forest
two hostile troops on a field of battle are two wrestlers
it is a question of seizing the opponent round the waist
the one seeks to trip up the other
they clutch at everything a bush is a point of support an angle of the wall offers them a rest to the shoulder for the lack of a novel under whose cover they can draw up a regiment yields its ground an unevenness in the ground a chance turn in the landscape across path encountered at the right moment a grove a ravine can stay the heel of that colossus which is called an army and prevent it's retreat
he who quits the field is beaten hence the necessity revolving on the responsible leader of examining the most insignificant clump of trees and of studying deeply the slightest relief in the ground
the two generals had attentively studied the plain of mont saint jean now called the plain of waterloo
on the preceding year wellington with the sagacity of foresight had examined it as the possible seat of a great battle
upon this spot and for this duel on the gulf june wellington had the good post napoleon the bad post
the english army was stationed above the french army below
it is almost superfluous here to sketch the appearance of napoleon on horseback glass in hand upon the height so grissom me at daybreak on june
all the world has seen him before we can show him
that calm profile under the little three corners what of the school of brienne that green uniform the white refer sconce suing the star of the legion of honor his great coat hiding his epaulets the corner of red ribbon peeping from beneath his best his leather trousers the white horse with the saddle cloth of purple velvet bearing on the corners crowned n' s and eagles hessian boots over silk stockings silver spurs the sword of marengo that whole figure of the last of the caesars is present to all imaginations saluted with acclamations by some severely retarded by others
that figure stood for a long time wholly in the light this arose from a certain legendary dimness evolved by the majority of heroes and which always veils the truth for a longer or shorter time but today history and daylight have arrived
that light called history is pitiless it possesses thisl' eau lost and divine quality that pure light as it is and precisely because it is wholly light it often casts a shadow in places where people had hitherto be held days from the same man it constructs two different phantoms and the one attacks the other and executes justice on it and the shadows of the despot contend with the brilliancy of the leader

chapter v. the quick back run of battles everyone is acquainted with the first phase of this battle a beginning which was troubled uncertain hesitating menacing to both armies but still more so for the english than for the french
it had rained all night the earth had been cut up by the downpour the water had accumulated here and there in the hollows of the plain as i find asks at some points the year of the artillery carriages was buried up to the axles the cir singles of the horses were dripping with liquid mud
if the wheat and the trampled down by this cohort of transporte on the march had not filled in the ruts and strewn all the r beneath the wheels all movement particularly in the valleys in the direction of pale lotte would have been impossible
the affair began late
napoleon as we have already explains dead in the habit of keeping all his artillery well in hand like a pistol coming it now at one point now at another of the battle and it had been his wish to wait until the horse batteries could move and gallop freely
in order to do that it was necessary that the sun should come out and dry the soil
but the sun did not make its appearance
it was no longer the rendezvous of austerlitz
when the first cannon was fired the english general colville looked at his watch and noted that it was thirty five minutes past eleven
the action was begun furiously with more fury perhaps than the emperor would have wished by the left wing of the french resting on you go mint
at the same time napoleon attack rd the centre by hurling quilt's brigade in la half saints and get pushed forward the right wing of the french against the left wing of the english which rested on papell the
the attack on your on ont was something of adding the plan was to draw wellington thither and to make him swerve to the left
this plan would have succeeded of the four companies of the english guards and the brave belgian won per pincher's division had not held the position solidly and wellington instead of mass in this troops there could confine himself to despatching thither as reinforcements only four more companies of guards and one battalion from brunswick
the attack of the right wing of the french on pape lotte was calculated in fact to overthrow the english left to cut off the road to brussels to bar the passage against possible prussians to force mont saint jean to turn wellington back on you go month hence on brainsl' all eur thence on hal nothing easier
with the exception of a few incidents this attack succeeded pape lotte was taken la baie saints was carried
a detail to be noted
there was in the english infantry particularly unkempt's brigade a great many had recruits
these young soldiers were valiant in the presence of our redoubt able infantry their inexperience extricated them intrepid it from the dilemma they performed particularly excellent service as skirmishers the soldier skirmisher left somewhat to himself become a so to speak his own general
these recruits displayed some of the french ingenuity and fury
this novice of an infantry mad dash
this displeased wellington
after the taking of la baie sainte the battle wavered
there is in this day an obscure interval from midday to fouro'clock the middle portion of this battle is almost in distinct and participated in the sombre ness of the hand to hand conflict
twilight reigns over it
we perceive vast fluctuations in that for a dizzy mirage paraphernalia of war almost unknown today pendant col backs floating can detached cross belts cartridge boxes for grenades hussar colman's red boots with a thousand wrinkles heavy shall star landed with tot saves the almost black infantry of brunswick mingled with the scarlet infantry of england the english soldiers with great white circular pass on the slopes of their shoulders for epaulets the hanoverian light horse with their oblong vasquez of leather with brass bands and red hot details the scotch with their bare knees and plaids the great white gaiters of our grenadiers pictures not strategic lines what salvator ross requires not what is suited to the needs of tribes hval

whatever may be the combinations of the generals the shock of armed masses has an incalculable ebb
during the action the plans of the two leaders enter into each other and become mutually thrown out of shape
such a point of the field of battle devours more combatants than such another just as more or less spongy soils soak up more or less quickly the water which is poured on them
it becomes necessary to pour out more soldiers than one would like a series of expenditures which are the unforeseen

there was something there's remit
it has disappeared the open doors change place the sombre folds advance and retreats sort of wind from the sepulchre pushes forward girls back dist ends and disperses these tragic multitudes
what is a gray
an oscillation
the immobility of a mathematical plan expresses a minute not a day

rembrandt is better than van der meulen van der meulen exact at noon lies at threeo'clock
geometry is deceptive the hurricane alone is trustworthy
that is what confers on folate the right to contradict polybius
let us add that there is a certain instant when the battle degenerates into a combat becomes specialized and dispersed into innumerable detailed feats which to borrow the expression of napoleon himself belong rather to the biography of the regiments than to the history of the army
the historian has in this case the evident fight to sum up the whole
he can not do more than seize the principal outlines of the struggle and it is not given to anyone narrator however const if i took she may be to fix absolutely the form of that horrible cloud which is called a battle
this which is true of all great armed encounters is particularly applicable to waterloo
nevertheless at a certain moment in the afternoon the battle came to a point
chapter vi fouro'clock in the afternoon towards fouro'clock the condition of the english army was serious
the prince of orange was in command of the centre hill of the right wing pic gig of the left wing
the prince of orange desperate and intrepid shouted to the holland o belgians nassau

never retreat
hill having been weakened had come up to the support of wellington picton was dead
at the very moment when the english has captured from the french the flag of the th of the line the french had killed the english general picton with a bullet through the head
the battle had for wellington two bases of action you go montand la baie sainte you go mont still held out but was on fire la baie sainte was taken
of the german battalion which defended it only forty two men survived all the officers except five were either dead or captured
three thousand combatants has been massacred in that barn
a sergeant of the english guards the foremost boxer in england reputed invulnerable by his companions had been killed there by a little french drummer boy
baring had been dislodged alten put to the sword
many flags had been lost one from alten's division and one from the battalion of lunenburg carried by a prince of the house of deux ponts
the scotch gray's no longer existed ponsonby's great dragoons had been hacked to pieces
that valiant cavalry had bent beneath the lancers of bro and beneath the chirac sides of travers out of twelve hundred horses six hundred remained out of three lieutenant colonel's two lay on the earth hamilton wounded mater spain
ponsonby had fallen riddled by seven lance thrusts
gordon was dead
marsh was dead
two divisions the fifth and the sixth had been annihilated
you go mont injured land is sainte taken there now existed but one rallying point the centre
that point still held firm
wellington reinforced it
he summoned thither hill who was at merle brains he summoned chasse who was at brainsl' all eur
the centre of the english army rather concave very dense and very compact was strongly posted
it occupies the plateau of mont saint jean having behind it the village and in front of it the slope which was tolerably steep then
it rested on that's tour stone dwelling which at that time belonged to the domain of micelles and which marks the intersection of the roads a pile of the sixteenth century and so robust that the cannon balls rebounded from it without injuring it
all about the plateau the english had cut the hedges here and there madden bras jews in the hawthorn trees thrust the throat of a cannon between two branches embattled the shrubs
there artillery was ambushed in the brushwood
this punic labor incontestably authorized by war which permits traps was so well done that had o who has been despatched by the emperor at nineo'clock in the morning to reconnoitre the enemy's batteries had discovered nothing of it and had returned and reported to napoleon that there were no obstacles except the two barricades which barred the road to give lies androgen apps
it was at the season when the grain is tall on the edge of the plateau a battalion of kempf's brigade they marked with cars bones was concealed in the tall wheat
this assured and buttressed the centre of the anglo dutch army was well posted
the peril of this position lay in the forest one lignes then adjoining the field of battle and intersected by the ponds of groene near land boots for t
an army could not retreat thither without dissolving the regiments would have broken up immediately there
the artillery would have been lost among them presses
the retreat according to many a man versed in the art though it is disputed by others would have been a disorganized flight
to this centre wellington added one of chasse's brigade's taken from the right wing and one of a uncle's brigade's taken from the left wing plus clinton's division
to his english to the regiments of hallett to the brigades of mitchell to the guards of maitland he gave as reinforcements and aids the infantry of brunswick nassau's contingent lie in an seng's hanoverian can do more da's germans
this placed twenty six battalions under his hand
the right wing as chart assays was thrown back on the centre
an enormous battery was masked by sacks of earth at the spot where there now stands what is called the museum of waterloo
besides this wellington had behind arose in the ground somerset's dragoon guards fourteen hundred horse strong
it was the remaining half of the justly celebrated english cavalry
ponsonby destroyed somerset remained
the battery which it completed would have been almost are doubt was ranged behind a very low garden wall backed up with a coating of bags of sand and a large slope of earth
this work was not finished there had been no time to make a palisade for it
wellington uneasy but impassive was on horseback and there remained the whole day in the same attitude a little in advance of the old mill of mont saint jean which is still in existence beneath and in which an englishman an enthusiastic vandal purchased later on for two hundred francs cut down and carried off
wellington was cold my heroic
the bullets gained about him
his aide de camp gordon bell at his side
lord hill pointing to a shell which had burst said to him my lord what are your orders in case you are killed
to do like he replied wellington
to clinton he said laconic ally to hold this spot to the last man
the day was evidently turning out ill
wellington shouted to his old companions of talavera of vittoria of salamanca boys can retreat be thought of
think of old england
towards fouro'clock the english line drew back
suddenly nothing was visible on the crest of rmr plateau except the artillery and the sharpshooters the rest madrid appeared the regiments dislodged by the shells and the french bullets retreated into the bottom now intersected by the backroad of the farm of mont saint jean a retrograde love me by took place the english from this itself wellington drew back
the beginning of retreat
cried napoleon
chapter vii napoleon in a good humor the emperor though i'll and did commodes on horseback by a local trouble had never been in a better humor than on that day
his impe net r ability had been smiling ever since the morning
ont meth of june that profound soul masked by marble beamed blindly
the man who had been gloomy at austerlitz was bay at waterloo
the greatest favorites of destiny make mistakes
our joys are composed of shadow
the supreme smile is god's alone
rider caesar pompeii able bit said the legionaries of the culminate is legion
pompey was not destined to weapon that occasion but it is certain that caesar laughed
while exploring on horseback at oneo'clock on the preceding night in stock and rain in company with bertrand the communes in the neighborhood of ross on me satisfied at the sight of the long line of the english campfires illuminating the whole horizon from fri scheming to brainsl' all eur it had seemed to him that dare to whom he had assigned a day on the field of waterloo was exact to the appointment he stopped his horse and remained for some time motionless gazing at the lightning and listening to the thunder and this catalist was heard to cast into the darkness this mysterious saying we are in accord
napoleon was mistaken
they were no longer in accord
he took not a moment for sleep every instant of that night was maries by a joy for him
he traversed the line of the principal outposts halting here and there to talk to the sentinels
at half past two near the wood if you go months heard the tread of a column on the march he thought at the moment that it was a retreat on the part of wellington
he said it is the rear guard of the english getting underway for the purpose of de camping
i will take prisoners the six thousand english who have just arrived at ostend
he conversed expansively he regained the animation which he had shown at his landing on the first of march when he pointed out to the grand marshal the enthusiastic peasant of the gulf juan and cried well bertrand here is a reinforcement already
on the night of the tutor method june her allied wellington
that little englishman needs a lesson said napoleon
the rain redoubled in violence the thunder rolled while the emperor was speaking
at half past threeo'clock in the morning he lost one illusion officers who had been despatched to reconnoitre announced to him that the enemy was not making any movement
nothing was stirring not a bivouac fire had been extinguished the english army was asleep
the silence on earth was profound the only noise was in the heavens
at fouro'clock a peasant was brought into him by the scouts this peasant had served as guide to a frog axel f english cavalry probably vivian's brigade which was on its way to take up a position in the village of pha in at the extreme left
at fiveo'clock two belgian deserters reported to him that they had just quitted their regiment and that the english army was ready for battle
so much the better
exclaimed napoleon
i prefer to overthrow them rather than to drive them back
in the morning he dismounted in the mud on the slope which forms an angle with the plan ceno it road had a kitchen table and a peasant's chair brought to him from the farm of god somme seated himself with a truss of straw for a carpet and spread out on the table the chart of the battlefield saying to soul has he did so a pretty checkerboard
in consequence of the rains during the night the transports of provisions embedded in the soft roads had not been able to arrive by morning the soldiers had had no sleep they were wet and fasting
this did not prevent napoleon from exclaiming cheerfully to hey we have ninety chances out of a hundred
at eighto'clock the emperor's breakfast was brought to him
he invited many general st. kit
during breakfast it was said that wellington had been to a ball two nights before in brussels at the duchess of richmond's and soul ta rough man of war with a face of an archbishop said the ball takes place today
the emperor nested with hey who said wellington will not be so simple as to wait for your majesty
that was his way however
he was fond of nesting says fleury dec jan oil on
a merry humor was at the foundation of his character says you fraud
he abounded in pleasantries which were more peculiar than witty says benjamin constant
the senate ties of a giant are worthy of insistence
it was he who called his grenadiers his grumbled she pinched their ears he pulled their mustaches
the emperor did nothing but play pranks on us is there mark of one of them
during the mysterious trip from the island of elba to france ont meth of february on the open sea the french brig of war is zephyr having encountered the brink' in constant on which napoleon was concealed and having asked the news of napoleon froml' inconstant the emperor who still wore in his hat the white and amaranth one cock are sown with bees which he had adopted at the isle of elba laughingly seized the speaking trumpet and answered for himself the emperor is well
a man who laughs like that is on familiar terms with events
napoleon indulged in many bits of this laughter during the breakfast at waterloo
after breakfast he hesitated for a quarter of an hour then two generals seated themselves on the truss of straw pen in hand and their paper on their knees and the emperor dictated to them the order of battle
at nineo'clock at the instant when the french army ranger in echelons and set in motion in five columns had deployed the divisions in two lines the artillery between the brigades the music at their head as they beat the marsh with rolls on the drums and the blasts of trumpets mighty vast joyous a sea of vasquez of sabres and of bayonets on the horizon the emperor was touched and twice exclaimed magnificent
magnificent
between nineo'clock and half past ten the whole army incredible as it may appear had taken up its position and ranged itself in six lines forming to repeat the emperor's expression the future of sixd' s
a few moments after the formation of the battle array on the midst of that profound silence like that which heralds the beginning of a storm which precedes engagements the emperor tapped hack on the shoulder as he beheld the three batteries of twelve pounders detached by his orders from the corps over long wills and lo bay and destined to begin the action by taking mont saint jean which was situated at the intersection of the micelles and there nappe roads and said to him there are four and twenty handsome maids general
sure of the issue he encouraged with a smile as they passed before him the company of calpers of the first corps which he had appointed to barricade mont saint jean as soon as the village should be carried
all this serenity had been traversed by but a single word of naughty port perceiving on his left at a spot where there now stands a large tomb those admirable scotch grays with their superb horses massing themselves he said it is a pity
then be mounted his horse advanced beyond ross on me and selected for his post of observations contracted elevation of turf to the right of the road from ge mappe to brussels which was his second station during the battle
the third station the one adopted at seveno'clock in the evening between labelle alliance and mahale sainte is formidable it is a rather elevated knoll which still exists and behind which the guard was massed in a slope of the plain
around this knoll the balls rebounded from the pavements of the road up to napoleon himself
as at brienne he had over his head the shriek of the bullets and of the heavy artillery
mouldy cannonball sold sword blades and shapeless projectiles eaten up with rust were picked up at the spot where his horse' feet stoke
scabra rubini be
a few years ago as hell of sixty pounds still charged and with its fuse broken off level with the bomb was unearthed
it was at this last post that the emperor said to his guide lacoste a hostile and terrified peasant who was attached to the saddle of a hussar and who turned found at every discharge of canister and tried to hide behind napoleon doll it is shameful
you'll get yourself killed with a ball in the back
he who writes these lines has himself found in the friable soil of this knoll on turning over the sand the remains of the neck of a bomb disintegrated by the paid ization of six and forty years and old fragments of iron which parted like elder twigs between the fingers
everyone is aware that the variously inclined undulations of the plains where the engagement between napoleon and wellington took place are no longer what they were on june
by taking from this mournful field the wherewithal to make a monument to it its real relief has been taken away and history disconcerted no longer finds her bearings there
it has been disfigured for the sake of glorify ingot
wellington when he beheld waterloo once more two years later exclaimed they have altered by field of battle
where the great pyramid of earth surmounted by the lion rises today there was a hillock which descended on an easy slope towards the micelles road but which was almost an escarpment on the side of the highway to be nappe
the elevation of this escarpment can still be measured by the height of the two knolls of the two great c soul chess which enclose the road from gen. apps to brussels one the english tomb is on the left the other the german tomb is on the right
there is no french tomb
the whole of that plain is a sepulchre for france
thanks to the thousands upon thousands of cart loads of earth employed in the hillock one hundred and fifty feet in height and half a mile in circumference the plateau of mont saint jean is now accessible by an easy slope
on the day of battle particularly on the side of la baie saints it was abrupt and difficult of approach
the slope there is so steep that the english cannon could not see the farm situated in the bottom of the valley which was the centre of the combat
ont meth of june the rains had still farther increased this acclivity the mud complicated the problem of the ascent and the men not only slipped back but stuck fast in the more
along the crest of the plateau ran a sort of french whose presence it was impossible for the distant observer to divine
what was this trench
let us explain
brainsl' alleys is a belgian village on aim is another
these villages both of them concealed in curves of the landscape are connected by a road about a league and a half in length which traverses the plain along its undulating level and often enters and buried itself in the hills like a furrow which makes a ravine of this road in some places
in as at the present say this road but the crest of the plateau of mont saint jean between the two highways from gen. apps and micelles only it is now on a level with the plain it was then a hollow way
it's two slopes have been appropriated for the monumental hillock
this road was and still is a trench throughout the greater portion of its course a hollow french sometimes a dozen feet in depth and whose banks being too steep crumbled away here and there particularly in winter under driving rain s
accidents happened here
the road was so narrow at the brainsl' all eur entrance that a passerby was crushed by a carta disproved by a stone cross which stands near the cemetery and which gives the name of the dead monsieur bernard feb the merchant of brussels and the date of the accident february
it was so deep in the table land of mont saint jean that a peasant mathieu no cause was crushed therein by a slide from the slope as is stated on another stone cross the top of which has disappeared in the process of clearing the ground but whose overturned pedestal is still visible on the grassy slope to the left of the highway between land is saints and the farm of mont saint jean
on the day of battle this hollow road whose existence was in no way indicated bordering the crest of mont saint jean a trench at the summit of the escarpment army concealed in the soil was invisible that is to say terrible
chapter viii the emperor puts a question to the guide lacoste so on the morning of waterloo napoleon was content
he was right the plan of battle conceived by him was as we have seen really admirable
the battle once begun its very various changes the resistance of you go mont the tenacity of la baie sainte the killing of gaudy in the disabling of fly the unexpected wall against which so he's brigade was shattered guillemin pt's fatal needless news when he had neither per are not powder sacks the hiring of the batteries the fifteen unescorted pieces overwhelmed in a hollow way by uxbridge the small effect of the bombs falling in the english lines and there embedding themselves in the rain soaked soil and only succeeding in producing volcanoes of mud so that the canister was turned into a splash the uselessness of life's demonstration on brainsl' all due all that cavalry fifteen squadron's almost exterminated the right wing of the english badly alarmed the left wing badly cut into ney's strange mistake in massing instead of echelon ning the four divisions of the first corpsman delivered over to grapes not arranged in ranks twenty seven deep and with a frontage of two hundred the frightful holes made in these masses by the cannon balls attacking columns disorganized the side battery suddenly unmasked on their blank bourgeois donde lot and dury the compromised quilt repulsed lieutenant vieux that hercules graduated at the polytechnic school wounded at the moment when he was beating i'm with an axe the door of la baie sainte under the downright fire of the english barricade which barred the angle of the road from gen. apps to brussels mar forget's division caught between the infantry and the cavalry shot down at the very muzzle of the guns amid the grain by bestand pack put to the sword by ponsonby his battery of seven pieces spiked the prince of race weimar holding and guarding in spite of the comted' erp on both frisch ebony and shona in the flag of the th taken the flag of the th captured that black prussian his war stopped by runners of the flying column of three hundred light cavalry on the scout between waves and plans en out the alarming things that had been said by prisoners grouchy's delay fifteen hundred men killed in the orchard if you go mo mt in less than an hour eighteen hundred men overthrown in a still shorter time about la baie sainte all these stormy incidents passing like the clouds of battle before napoleon had hardly troubled his gaze and had not overshadowed that factor imperial certainty
napoleon was accustomed to gaze steadily at war he never added up the heartrending details filter by cipher ciphers mattered little to him provided that they furnished the total victory he was not alarmed if the beginnings did go astray since he thought himself the master and the possessor at the end he knew how to wait supposing himself to be out of the question and he treated destiny as his equal he seemed to say to date thou wilt not care
composed half of light and half of shadow napoleon thought himself protected in good and tolerated in evil
he had or thought that he had a connivance one might almost says simplicity of events in his favor which was equivalent to the invulnerability of antiquity
nevertheless when one has beres in a leipzig and fontainebleau behind one it seems as though one might distrust waterloo
a mysterious brown becomes perceptible in the depths of the heavens
at the moment when wellington retreated napoleon shuddered
he suddenly be held the table land of mont saint jean cleared and the fan of the english army disappear
it was rallying but hiding itself
the emperor half rose in his stirrups
the lightning of victory flashed from his eyes
wellington driven into a corner at the forest les lignes and destroyed that was the definitive conquest of england by france its secrecy poitiers map plaque bandra millie's avenged
the man of marengo was wiping out agincourt
so the emperor meditating on this terrible turn of fortune swept his glass for the last time overall the points of the field of battle
his guard standing behind him with grounded arms watched him from below with a sort of religion
he pondered be examined the slopes noted the've click ties scrutinized the clumps of trees the square of the the path he seemed to be counting each buch
he gazed with some intent news at the english barricades of the two highways two large what is of trees that on the road to be naples novel chair sainte armed with two canyon the only ones out of all the english artillery which commanded the extremity of the field of battle and that on the road to micelles where gleamed the dutch bayonets of chasse's brigade
near this barricade he observed the old chapel of saint nicholas painted white which stands at the angle of the cross road near train el' alley she bent down and spoke in a low voice to the guide lacoste
the guide made a negative sign with his head which was probably perfidious
the emperor straightened himself up and fell to thinking
wellington had drawn back
all that remained to do was to complete this retreat by crushing him
napoleon turning round abruptly despatched an express at full speed to paris to announce that the battle was won
napoleon was one of those geniuses from whom thunder darts
he had just found his clap of thunder
he gave orders to milhaud's cuirass idea to carry the table land of mont saint jean
chapter ix the unexpected there were three thousand five hundred of them
they formed a front a quarter of a league in extent
they were giant men on colossal horses
there were six and twenty squadrons of them and they had behind them to support them lefebvre des mouette's's division the one hundred and six picked gendarmes the light cavalry of the guard eleven hundred and ninety seven men and the lancers of the guard of eight hundred and eight glances
they wore cassie's without horse tails and cuirasses of beaten iron with horse pistols in their holsters and long sabres words
that morning the whole army had admired them when at nineo'clock with graying of trumpets and all the music playing let us watcho'er the safety of the empire they had come in a solid column with one of their batteries on their blank another in their centre and deployed in two ranks between the road store maple and fro scheming and taken up their position for garrod in that powerful second line so cleverly arranged by napoleon which having on its extreme left kellermann's suit assists and on its extreme right milhaud's cuirass kershaw so to speak two wings of iron
aide de camp bernard carried them the emperor's orders
net drew his sword and placed himself at their head
the enormous squadrons were set in motion
then a formidable spectacle was seen
all their cavalry with upraised swords standards and trumpets clung to the breeze formed in columns by divisions descended by a simultaneous movement and like one man with the precision of a brazen battering ram which is effecting a breach the bill of la belle alliance plunged into the terrible depths in which so many men had already fallen did appeared there in the smoke then emerging from that shadow reappeared on the other side of the valley still compact and in close ranks mounting at a full trot through a storm of grapes hot which burst upon them the terrible muddy slope of the table land of mont saint jean
they ascended grade threatening imperturbable in the intervals between the musketry and the artillery their colossal trampling was audible
being two divisions there were two columns of the meat hier's division held the right report's division was on the left
it seemed as though two immense adders of steel were to be seen crawling towards the crest of the tableland
it traverses the battle like a prodigy
nothing like it had been seen since the taking of the great redoubt of the muskie why the heavy cavalry murat was lacking here but hey was again present
it seemed as though that mass had become a monster and had but one soul
each column undulated and swelled like the ring of a polyp
they would be seen through a vast cloud of smoke which was rent here and there
a confusion of helmets of cries of sabres a stormy heading of these uppers of horses amid the cannons and the flourish of trumpets a terrible and disciplined tumult overall the cuirasses like the scales on the hydra
there narrations seemed to belong to another age
something parallel to this vision appeared no doubt in the ancient orphic epics which told of the centaurs the old hip panty ropes those titans with human heads and equestrian chests who scaled olympus at a gallop horrible invulnerable sublime gods and beasts
odd numerical coincidence twenty six battalions ride to meet twenty six cart spoons
behind the crest of the plateau in the shadow of the masked battery the english infantry formed into thirteen squares two battalions to the square in two lines with seven in the first line six in the second the stocks of their guns to their shoulders taking aim at that which was on the point of appearing waited calm mute motionless
they did not see the china's sites and the suit assists did not see them
they listened to the rise of this flood of men
they heard the dwelling house of three thousand horse the alternate and symmetrical tramp of their goods at full trot the mingling of the cuirasses the clang of the sabres and a sort of grand and savage breathing
there ensued a most terrible silence the ball at once a long file of uplifted arms brandishing sabres appeared above the crest and cars yes trumpets and standards and three thousand years with gray mustaches shouting givel' empereur
all this cavalry ce boucheron the plateau and it was like the appearance of an earthquake
all at once a tragic incident on the english left on our right the head of the column of cuir assists reared up with a frightful clamor
on arriving at the culminating point of the crest ungovernable utterly given over to duty and their course of extermination of the squares and cannon the cuirass kershaw just caught sight of a trench a trench between them and the english
it was the hollow road of one in
it was a terrible moment
the ravine was there unexpected yawning directly under the horses' feet two fathoms deep between its double slopes the second file pushed the first into it and the third pushed on the second the horses reared and fell backward landed on their haunches slid down all four feet in the air crushing and overwhelming the riders and there being no means of retreat the whole column being no longer anything more than a projectile the force which had been acquired to crush the english crushed the french the inexorable ravine could only yield when filled horses and riders rolled there pell help grinding each other forming but one mass of flesh in this gulf when this trench was full of living men the rest marched over them and passed on
almost a third of dubois's brigade fell into that abyss
this fey at the loss of the battle
a local tradition which evidently exaggerates matters says that two thousand horses and fifteen hundred men were buried in the hollow road o domain
this figure probably comprises all the other corpses which were flung into this ravine the day after the combat
let us vote in passing that it was dubois's sorely tried brigade which an hour previously making a charge to one side had captured the flag of the lunenburg battalion
napoleon before giving the order for this charge of milhaud's cuirass kershaw scrutinized the ground but had not been able to see that hollow road which did not even form a wrinkle in the surface of the plateau
warnes nevertheless and put on the alert by the little whitechapel which marks its angle of junction with the novel lee highway he had probably put a question as to the possibility of an obstacle to the guide lacoste
the guide has answered no
we might almost affirm that napoleon's catastrophe originated in that sign of a peasant's head
other fatalities were destined to arise
was it possible that napoleon should have won that battle
we answer no
why
because of wellington
because of boucher
no
because of god
bonaparte victor at waterloo that does not come within the law of the nineteenth century
another series of facts was in preparation in which the dress no longer any room for napoleon
the ill will of events had declared itself long before
it was time that this vast man should fall
the excessive weight of this man in human destiny disturbed the balance
this individual alone counted for more than a universal group
these plethora so ball human vitality concentrated in a single head the world mounting to the grain of one man this would be mortal to civilization were in to last
the moment had arrived for the incorruptible and supreme equity to alter its plan
probably the principles and the elements in which the regular gravitation's of the moral as of the material world depend had complained
smoking blood overfilled cemeteries mothers in tears these are formidable p leaders
when the earth is suffering from top heavy a burden there are mysterious groaning's on the shares to which the abyss lends an ear
napoleon had been denounced in the infinite and his fall had been decided on
he embarrassed god
waterloo is not a battle it is a change of front on the part of the universe
chapter x. the plateau of mont saint jean they street was unmasked at the same moment with the ravine
sixty cannons and the thirteen squares darted lightning point blank on the chur assists
the intrepid general report made the military salute to the english battery
the whole of the flying artillery of the english had reentered the squares at a gallop
the cuirass kershaw not had even the time for a halt
the disaster of the hollow road had decimated but not discouraged them
they belonged to that class of men who when diminished in number increase in courage
wat niet's column alone had suffered in the disaster de lord's column which net had deflected to the left as though he had a presentiment of an ambush had arrived whole
the suit assists hurled themselves on the english squares
at full speed with bridles looses words in their teeth pistols in fish such was the attack
there are moments in battles in which the soul hardens the man until the soldier is changed into a statue and when all this flesh turns into granite
the english battalions desperately assaulted did not stir
then it was terrible
all the faces of the english squares were attacked at once
a frenzied whirl enveloped them
that cold infantry remained impassive
the first rank knelt and received the chirac's legs on their bayonets the second ranks shot them down behind the second rank the cannon were charged their guns the front of the square parted permitted the passage of an eruption of grapes hot and closed again
the suit assists replied by crushing them
their great horse created strode across the ranks leaped over the bayonets and fell gigantic in the midst of these four living wells
the cannon balls ploughed furrows on these cuir assists the chir assists made breaches in the squares
files of men disappeared ground to dust under the horses
the bayonets plunged into the bellies of these centaurs hence a hideous ness of wounds which has probably never been seen anywhere else
the squares wasted by this had cavalry closed up their ranks without flinching
inexhaustible in the matter of grapes not they created explosions in their assailants' midst
the form of this combat was monstrous
these squares were no longer battalions they were craters those cuirass legs were no longer cavalry they were a tempest
each square was a volcano attacked by a cloud la ca contended with lightning
the square on the extreme right the most exposed of all being in the air was almost annihilated at the very first shock
it was formed of the th regiment of highlanders
the bagpipe player on the centre dropped his melancholy eyes filled with the reflections of the forests and the lakes in profound in attention while men were being exterminated around him and seated on a drum with his pin rich under his arm played the highland aids
these scotch men died thinking of ben lothian as did the greeks recalling argos
the sword of acu it easier which he wed down the bagpipes and the arm which bore it put an end to the song by killing the singer
the suit assists relatively few in number and still further diminished by the catastrophe of the ravine had almost the whole english army against them but they multiplied themselves so that each man of them was equal to ten
nevertheless some hanoverian battalions yielded
wellington perceived it and thought of his cavalry
had napoleon at that same moment thought of his infantry he would have won the battle
this forgetfulness was his great and fatal mistake
all at once the cuirass i ers who had been the assailants found themselves assailed
the english cavalry was at their back
before them two squares behind them somerset somerset meant fourteen hundred dragoons of the guard
on the right somerset had worn berg with the german light horse and on his left trip with the belgian cars binders the suit assists attacked on the flank and in front before and in the rear by infantry and cavalry had to face all sides
what mattered it to them
they were a quirk wind
their valor was something indescribable
in addition to this they had behind them the battery which was still thundering
it was necessary that it should be sold they could never have been wounded in the back
one of their cuirasses pierced on the shoulder by a ball from a bid catania in the collection of the waterloo museum
for such frenchmen nothing less than such englishmen was needed
it was no longer a hand to hand conflict it was a shadow a fury a dizzy transport of souls and courage a hurricane of lightning swords
in an instant the fourteen hundred dragoon guards numbered only eight hundred
fuller their lieutenant colonel fell dead
net rushed up with the lancers and lefebvre de chouette's's light horse
the plateau of mont saint jean was captured recaptured captured again
the cuirass let's quitted the cavalry to return to the infantry or to put it more exactly the whole of that formidable doug collared each other without releasing the other
the squares still held firm
there were a dozen assaults
net had four horses killed under him
half the suit assists remained on the plateau
this conflict lasted two hours
the english army was profoundly shaken
there is no doubt that had they not been's news fled in their first shock by the disaster of the hollow road the cuirass legs would have overwhelmed the centre and decided the victory
this extraordinary cavalry petrified clinton who had seen talavera and badajoz
wellington three quarters vanquished admired heroically
he said in an undertone sublime
the suit assists annihilated seven squares out of thirteen tool or spiked sixty pieces of ordnance and captured from the english regiments six flags which three duke assists and three chasseur's of the guard forego the emperor in front of the farm of la belle alliance
wellington's situation had grown worse
this strange battle was like a duel between two raging wounded men each of whom still fighting and still resisting is expending all his blood
which of the two will be the first to fall
the conflict on the plateau continued
what had become of the cuirass ifrs
no one could have told
one thing is certain that on the day after the battle a suit assist and his horse were found dead among the woodwork of the scales for vehicles at mont saint jean at the very point where the four roads from give loss gen appel a tulle and brussels meet and intersect each other
this horseman had pierced the english lines
one of the men who picked up the body still lives at mont saint jean
his name ieee haze
he was eighteen years old at that time
wellington felt that he was yielding
the crisis was at hand
the cuirass kershaw not succeeded since the centre was not broken through
as everyone was in possession of the plateau no one held it and in fact it remained to a great extent with the english
wellington held the village and the culminating plain net had only the crest and the slope
they seemed rooted in that fatal soil on both sides
but the weakening of the english seemed irremediable
the bleeding of that army was horrible
kempton the left wing demanded reinforcements
there are none replied well lytton he must let himself be killed
almost at that same moment a singular coincidence which paints the exhaustion of the two armies net demanded infantry from napoleon and napoleon exclaimed infantry
where does he expect me to get it
does he think i can make it
nevertheless the english army was in the worse case of the two
the curious on sets of those great squadrons with cuirasses of iron and breasts of steel had ground the infantry to nothing
a few men clustered found a flat marked the post of a regiment such and such a battalion was commanded only by a captain of a lieutenant alten's division already so roughly handled at la baie sainte was almost destroyed the intrepid belgians of canol use's brigade strewed the eye fields all along the micelles road hardly anything was left of those dutch grenadiers who intermingled with spaniards in our ranks in fought against wellington and who in rallied to the english standard fought against napoleon
the loss in officers was consider a vle
lord uxbridge who had his leg buried on the following day had his knee shattered
if on the french side in that tussle of the cuirass let's reportl' neri tier colbert shop traders and blanca rd were disabled on the side of the english there was alten wounded barge wounded delancey killed can meet an kills comptes skilled the whole of wellington's staff decimated and england had the worse if it in that bloody scale
the second regiment of foot guards had lost five lieutenant colonel's four captains and three ensigns the first battalion of the th infantry had lost officers and soldiers the th highlanders had lost officers wounded officers killed soldiers killed
the hanoverian hussars of cumberland a whole regiment with colonel jack est its head who was destined to be tried later on and cashiered had turned bridle in the presence of the fray and had fled to the forest les lignes sowing defeat all the way to brussels
the transports ammunition wagons the baggage wagons the wagons filled with wounded in perceiving that the french were gaining ground and approaching the forest ridge c headlong thither
the dutch mowed down by the french cavalry cried alarm
from very cpu cpu to grow brenda el for a distance of nearly two leagues in the direction of brussels according to the testimony of eye witnesses who are still alive the roads were encumbered with fugitives
this panic was such that it attacked the prince seconds at mech lin and louis xviii
at ghent
with the exception of the feeble reserve echelon new behind the ambulance sarah listed at the farm of mont saint jean and of vivian's and van de leur's brigades which flanked the left wing wellington had no cavalry left
a number of batteries latin horses
these facts are attested by sib or new md pringle exaggerating the disaster goes so far as to say that the anglo dutch army was reduced to thirty four thousand men
the iron duke remained calm but his lips blanched
vincent the austrian commissioner aiada the spanish commissioner who were present at the battle in the english start thought the duke list
at fiveo'clock wellington drew out his watch and he was heard to murmur these sinister words blucher or night
it was at about that moment that a distant line of bayonets gleamed in the heights in the direction of frisch ebony
here comes the change of face in this giant drama
chapter xi a bad guide to napoleon a good guide to bulow the painful surprise of napoleon is well known
grouchy hoped for voucher arriving
death instead of life
date has these turns the throne of the world was expected it was saint helena that was seen
if the little shepherd who served as guide to bulow boucher's lieutenant had advised him to web ouch from the forest above fri scheming instead of below plans en out the form of the nineteenth century might perhaps have been different
napoleon would have won the battle of waterloo
by any other route than that below plans shoot the prussian army would have come out upon a ravine impassable for artillery and bulow would not have arrived
now the prussian general muffling declares that one hour's delay and blucher would not have found wellington on his feet
the battle was lost
it was time that bulls should arrive as will be seen
he had moreover been very much delayed
he had bivouac kedar dion lemont and had set out at daybreak but the roads were impassable and his divisions stuck fast in the more
the guys were up to the hubs of the cannons
moreover he had been obliged to pass the file on the narrow bridge of wavre the street leading to the bridge had been fired by the french so the caissons and ammunition wagons could not pass between two rows of burning houses and had been obliged to wait until the conflagration was extinguished
it was midday before nulld' s vanguard had been able to reach chapelle saint lambert
had the action been begun two hours far list it would have been over at fouro'clock and blucher would have fallen on the battle won by napoleon
such are these immense risks proportioned to an infinite which we can not comprehend
the emperor had been the first as early as midday to see cry with his field glass on the extreme horizon something which had attracted his attention
he had said i see yonder a cloud which seems to me to be troops
then he asked the duc de salma ties kult what do you see in the direction of chapelle saint lambert
the marshal levelling his glass answered four or five thousand men site evidently grouchy
but it remained motionless in the mist
all the glasses of the staff had studied the cloud pointed out by the emperor
some said it is trees
the truth is that the cloud did not move
the emperor detached do mon's division of light cavalry to recon jolted in that quarter
bulow had not moved in fact
his vanguard was very feeble and could accomplish nothing
he was obliged to wait for the body of the army corps and he had received orders to concentrate his forces before entering into line but at fiveo'clock perceiving wellington's peril blucher ordered by low to attack and uttered these remarkable words we must give air to the english army
a little later the bibi sions of lost him biller hacks and russel deployed before log au's corps the cavalry of prince william of prussia de boucher from the forest of paris plan ceno it was in flames and the prussian cannon balls began to gain even upon the ranks of the guard in reserve behind napoleon

history records nothing more touching than that agony bursting forth in acclamations
the sky had been overcast all day long
all of a sudden at that very moment it was eighto'clock in the evening the clouds on the horizon parted and allowed the grand and sinister glow of the setting sun to pass through athwart the elms in the novel lee road
they had seen it rise at austerlitz
each battalion of the guard was commanded by a general for this final catastrophe
friant michel robust market mallet poder de morgan were there
when they all caps of the grenadiers of the guard with their large plaques bearing the eagle appeared symmetrical in line tranquil in the midst of that combat the enemy delta respect for trance they thought they beheld twenty victories entering the field of battle with wings out spread and those who were the conquerors believing themselves to be vanquished retreated but wellington shouted up guards and aim straight
the red regiment of english guards lying flat behind the hedges sprang up a cloud of grapes hot riddled the tricolored flag and whistled round our eagles all hurled themselves forwards and the final carnage began
in the darkness the imperial guard felt the army losing ground around it and in the east shock of the tikrit heard the desperate flight which had taken the place of the fivel' empereur
and with flight behind it if continued to advance more crushed losing more men at every step that it took
there were none who hesitates no timid men in its ranks

but in vain he did not die
he was haggard and angry
at drouetd' eglon he hurled this question are you not going to get yourself killed
in the midst of all that artillery engaged in crushing a handful of men he shouted so there is nothing for me
oh
i should like to have all these english bullets enter my bowels
unhappy man thou wert reserved for french bullets
chapter xiii the catastrophe the rout behind the guard was melancholy
the army yielded suddenly on all sides at once you go mont lahaye sainte papell the plan de noir

the prussian cavalry newly arrived dashes forwards flies news slashes kills exterminates

the shadow of an enormous right is projected at heart waterloo
it is the day of destiny
the force which is high tide than man produced that day
hence the terrified wrinkle of those brows hence all those great souls surrendering their swords
those who had conquered europe have fallen prone on the earth with nothing left to say not to do feeling the present shadow of a terrible presence
hose rating atis
that day the perspective of the human race underwent a change
waterloo is the hinge of the nineteenth century
the disappearance of the great man was necessary to the advent of the great century
someone a person to whom one replies not took the responsibility on himself
the panic of heroes can be explained
in the battle of waterloo there is something more than a cloud there is something of the meteor
god has passed by
at nightfall in a meadow ne arg e mappe bernard and bertrand seized by the skirt of his coat and detained a man haggard pensive sinister gloomy who dragged to that point by the current of the rough adjust dismounted had passed the bridle of his horse over his arm and with wild eye was returning alone to waterloo
it was napoleon the immense com nambu list of this dream which has crumbled es saying once more to advance
chapters of the last square several squares of the guard motionless amid this stream of the defeat as rocks in running water held their own until night
night came death also they awaited that double shadow and invincible allowed themselves to be enveloped there in
each regiment isolated from the rest and having to bond with the army now shattered in every part diet alone
they had taken up position for this final action some of the heights of ross on me others on the plain of mont saint jean
there abandoned vanquished terrible those gloomy squares endured their death throes in formidable fashion
ulm wagram jena friedland died with them
at twilight towards nineo'clock in the evening one of them was left at the foot of the plateau of mont saint jean
in that fatal valley at the foot of that declivity which the cuirass here had ascended now inundated by the masses of the english under the converging fires of the victorious hostile cavalry under a frightful density of projectiles this square fought on
it was commanded by an obscure officer named cambro nns
at each discharge the square diminished and replies
it replied to the grapes not with a fusillade continually contracting its four walls
the fugitives pausing breathless for a moment in the distance listened in the darkness to that gloomy and ever decreasing thunder
when this legion had been reduced to a handful when nothing was left of their flag but arab when their guns the bullets all gone were no longer anything but clubs when the heap of corpses was larger than the group of survivors there reigned among the conquerors around those men dying so sublimely a sort of sacred terror and the english artillery taking breath became silent
this furnished a sort of respite
these combatants had around them something in the nature of a swarm of spectres silhouettes of men on horseback the black profiles of cannon the white sky viewed through wheels and gun carriages the colossal death's head which the heroes was constantly through the smoke in the depths of the battle advanced upon them and gazed at them
through the shades of twilight they could hear the pieces being loaded the matches all lighted like the eyes of tigers at night formed a circle round their heads all the long stocks of the english batteries approached the cannons and then with emotion holding the supreme moment suspended above the semen an english general colville according to some maitland according to others shouted to them surrender brave frenchmen
damn ronne replies
editor's commentary another edition of this book has the word merde
in lieu of the above
chapter xv can be on me if any french reader object to having his suscep to bilities offended one would have to refrain from repeating in his presence what is perhaps the finest reply that a frenchman ever made
this would en join us from consigning something sublime to history
at our own risk and peril let us violate this injunction
now then among those giants there was one titan cambro nne
to make that reply and then perish what could be grander
for being willing to die is the same as to die and it was not this man's fault if he survived after he was shot
the winner of the battle of waterloo was not napoleon who was put to flight not wellington giving way at fouro'clock in despair at five not blucher who took no part in the engagement
the winner of waterloo was cambro bne
to thunder forth such a reply at the lightning flash that kills you is to conquer
thus to answer the catastrophe this to speak to rate to give this pedestal to the future lion to hurl such a challenge to the midnight rain storm to the treacherous wall of you go mont to the sunken road pro ha into grouchy's delay to boucher's arrival to be irony itself in the tomb to act so as to stand upright though fallen to drown in two shop ables the european coalition to offer kings provide which the caesars once knew to make the lowest of words the most lofty by ent dining with it the glory of stance insolently to end waterloo with mardi gras to finish leonidas with tabella is to set the crown on this victory by a word impossible to speak to lose the field and preserve history to have the laugh on your side after such a carnage this is immense
it was an insult such as a thunder cloud might hurl
it reaches the grandeur of aeschylus
camfrog he's reply produces the effect of a violent break
' tis like the breaking of a heart under a weight of scorn
' tis the overflow of agony bursting forth
who conquered
wellington
no
use it not been for blucher he was lost
was it boucher
no
if wellington had not begun blucher could not have finished
this damn ronne this man spending his last hour this unknown soldier this infinitesimal of war realizes that here is a falsehood a falsehood in a catastrophe and so doubly agonizing and at the moment when his rage is bursting forth because of it he is offered this mockery life
how could be restrain himself
yonder are all the kings of europe the general's flushed with victory the jupiter's darting thunderbolts they have a hundred thousand victorious soldiers and back on the hundred thousand a million their cannon stand with yawning mouths the match is lighted they grind down under their heels the imperial guard's and the grand army they have just crushed napoleon and only can be on me remains only this earthworm is left to protest
he will protest
then he seeks for the appropriate word as one seeks for a sword
his mouth broths and the froth is the word
in face of this mean and mighty victory in face of this victory which counts none victorious this desperate soldier stands erect
he grants its overwhelming immensity but he establishes its triviality and he does more than spit upon it
borne down by numbers by superior force by brute matter he finds in his soul an expression excrement
we repeat it to use that word to do this to invent such an expression is to be the conqueror
the spirit of mighty days at that portentous moment made its descent on that unknown man
cambro nne invents the word for waterloo as rouget invents the marseillaise under the visitation of a breath from on high
an emanation from the divine whirlwind leaks forth and comes sweeping over these men and they shake and one of them sings the song supreme and the other utters the frightful cry
this challenge of titanic scorn can grommet urls not only at europe in the name of the empire that would be a trifle he hurls it at the past on the name of the revolution
it is heard and camfrog he is recognized as possessed by the ancient spirit of the titans
canton seems to be speaking
kleber seems to be bellowing
at that word from dam brunnette english voice responded fire
the batteries blamed the hill trembled from all those brazen mouths belched a last terrible gush of grapes not a vast volume of smoke vaguely white in the light of the rising moon rolled out and when the smoke dispersed there was no longer anything there
that formidable remnant had been annihilated the guard was dead
the four walls of the living redoubt pay prone and hardly was there discernible here and there even a quiver in the bodies it was thus that the french legions greater than the roman legions expired on mont saint jean on the soil watered with rain and blood amid the gloomy grain on the spot where nowadays joseph who drives the post wagon from novell e classes whistling and cheerfully whipping up his horse at fouro'clock in the morning
chapter xvi quot life as induce
the battle of waterloo is an enigma
it is as obscure to those who do not as to those who lost it
for napoleon it was a panic blucher sees nothing in it but fire wellington understands nothing in regard to it
look at the reports
the bulletins are confused the commentaries involved
some stammer others lisp
no mini divides the battle of waterloo into four moment shuffling cuts it up into these changes chart as a lone though we hold another judgment than his on some points seized with his naughty glance the characteristic outlines of that catastrophe of human genius in conflict with divine chance
all the other historians suffer from being somewhat dazzled and in this dazzled state the grumble about
it was a day of lightning brilliancy in fact a crumbling of the military monarchy which to the best stole faction of kings drew all the kingdoms after it the fall of force the defeat of war
on this event stamped with superhuman necessity the part played by men amounts to nothing
if we take waterloo from wellington and blucher died thereby deprive england and germany or anything
no
neither that illustrious england north at august germany enter into the problem of waterloo
thank heaven nations are great independently of the lugubrious feats of the sword
neither england now germany non france is contained in a scabbard
at this epoch when waterloo is only a clashing of swords above blucher germany has schiller above wellington england has byron
a vast dawn of ideas is the peculiarity of our century and in that aurora england and germany have a magnificent radiance
they are majestic because they think
the elevation of level which they contribute to civilization is intrinsic with them it proceeds from themselves and not from an accident
the aggrandizement which they have brought to the nineteenth century has not waterloo as its source
it is only barbarous peoples who undergo rapid growth after a victory
that is the temporary vanity of torrents swelled by a storm
civilized people especially in our day are neither elevated nora based by the good or bad fortune of a captain
their specific gravity in the human species results from something more than a combat
their honor thank god
their dignity their intelligence their genius are not numbers which those gambler's heroes and conquerors can put in the lottery of battles
often a battle is lost and progress is conquered
there is less glory and more liberty
the drum holds its peace reason takes the word
it is a game in which he who poses wins
let us therefore speak of waterloo solely from both sides
let us render to chance that which is due to chance and to god that which is due to god
what is waterloo
a victory
no
the winning number in the lottery
the quine won by europe paid by france
it was not worthwhile to place a lion there
waterloo moreover is the strangest encounter in history
napoleon and wellington
they are not enemies they are opposites
never did god who is fond of anti these shake a more striking contrast a more extraordinary comparison
on one side precision foresight geometry prudence an assured retreat reserves spared with an obstinate coolness an imperturbable method strategy which takes advantage of the ground tactics which preserve the equilibrium if battalions carnage executed according to rule war regulated watching and nothing voluntarily left to chance the ancient classic courage absolute regularity on the other intuition divination military oddity super human instinct a flaming glance an indescribable something which gases like an eagle and which strikes like the lightning a prodigious art in disdainful impetuosity all the mysteries of a profound soul associated with destiny the stream the plain the forest the hill summoned and in a manner forced to obey the despot going even so far as to tyrannize over the field of battle faith in as far mingled with strategic science elevating but perturbing it
wellington was the bare me of war napoleon was its michael angelo and on this occasion genius was vanquished by calculation
in both sides someone was awaited
it was the exact calculator who succeeded
napoleon was waiting for grouchy he did not come
wellington expected blucher he came
wellington is classic war taking it's revenge
bonaparte at his dawning had encountered him in italy and beaten him superbly
the old owl had fled before the young culture
the old tactics had been not only struck as by lightning but disgraced
who was that corsican of six and twenty
what signified that splendid ignoramus who with everything against him nothing in his favor without provisions without ammunition without cannon without shoes almost without an army with a mere handful of man against masses buried himself in europe combined and absurdly won victories in the impossible
whence had issued that culminating convict who almost without taking breath and with the same set of combatants in hand pulverized one after the other the five armies of the emperor of germany upsetting beaulieu on alvina i wurmser on beaulieu melas on wurmser jack on me lax
who was this novice in war with the effrontery of a luminary
the academical military school excommunicated him and as it lost its footing hence the implacable rancor of the old caesar i am against the new of the regular sword against the flaming sword and of the exchequer against genius
one method june that rancor had the last word
and beneath lodi montebello montego the mantua arcola it wrote waterloo
a triumph of the mediocre's which is sweet to the majority
destiny consented to this irony
in his decline napoleon found wurmser the younger again in front of him
in fact to get wurmser it suffices to blanch the hair of wellington
waterloo is a battle of the first order won by a captain of the second
that which must be admired in the battle of waterloo is england the english firmness the english resolution the english blood the superb thing about england there no offence to her ass herself
it as another captain it was her army
wellington oddly ungrateful declared in a letter to lord bathurst that his army the army which fought on the th of june was a detectable army
what does that sombre intermingling of bones buried beneath the furrows of waterloo think of that
england has been too modest in the matter of wellington
to make wellington so great is to be little england
wellington is nothing but a hero like many another
those switch grays those horseguards those regiments of maitland and of mitchell that infantry of package is not that cavalry of ponsonby and somerset those highlanders playing the pub rich under the showed of grapes hot those battalions of ryland t those utterly raw recruits who hardly knew how to handle a musket holding their own against rss king's and tivoli's old troops that is what east rand
wellington was tenacious in that lay his merit and we are not seeking to lessen it but the least of his foot soldiers and of his cavalry would have been as solid as he
the iron soldier is worth as much as the iron duke
as for us all our glorification goes to the english soldier to the english army to the english people
of trophy there be it is to england that the trophy issue
the column of waterloo would be more just if instead of the figure of a man ignore on high the statue of a people
but this great england will be angry at what we are saying here
she still cherishes after her own and out the feudal illusion
she believes in heredity and hierarchy
this people surpassed by none in power and glory regards itself as a nation and not as a people
and as a people it willingly subordinates itself and takes a lord for its head
as a workman it allows itself to be disdained as a soldier it allows itself to be flogged
it will be remembered that at the battle of inkerman na sergeant who had it appears saved the army could not be mentioned by lord pay lanas the english military hierarchy does not permit any hero below the grade of an officer to be mentioned in the reports
that which we admire above all in an encounter of the nature of waterloo is the marvellous cleverness of chance
a nocturnal gain the wall of you go mont the hollow road o domain grouchy deaf to the cannon napoleon's guide receiving him bulow's guide enlightening him the whole of this cataclysmic wonderfully conducted
on the whole let us say it plainly it was more of a massacre than of a battle at waterloo
of all pitched battles waterloo is the one which has the smallest front for such a number of combatants
napoleon three quarters of a league wellington half a league seventy two thousand combatants on each side
from this sense ness the carnage a rose
the following calculation has been made and the following proportion established loss of men at austerlitz french fourteen percent russians thirty percent austrians forty four percent
area gram french thirteen percent austrians fourteen
at the moskow a french thirty seven percent russians forty four
at bautzen french thirteen percent russians and prussians fourteen
at waterloo french fifty six percent the allows thirty one
total for waterloo forty one percent one hundred and forty four thousand combatants sixty thousand dead
today the field of waterloo has the calm which belongs to the earth the imp as dogs support of man and it resembles all plains
at night moreover a sort of visionary most arises from it and if a travellers trolls there if he listens if he watches if he dreams like virgil on the fatal plains of philippi the hallucination of the catastrophe takes possession of him
the frightful th of june lives again the false monumental hillock disappears the lion vanishes in air the battlefield resumes its reality lines of infantry undulate over the plain furious gallop's traverse the horizon the frightened dreamer beholds the flash of sabres the gleam of bayonets the flare of bombs the tremendous interchange of thunder she hears as it were the death rattle in the depths of a tomb the vague clamor of the battle phantom those shadows are grenadiers those lights are chirac akers that skeleton napoleon that other skeleton is wellington all this no longer exists and yet it clashes together and combat's still and the ravines are em purples and the trees quiver and there is fury even in the clouds and in the shadows all those terrible heights you go month on twwly the andris che non to spell the plan de boot appear confusedly crowned with whirlwinds of spectres engaged in exterminating each other
chapter xvii is waterloo to be considered good
there exists a very respectable liberal school which does not hate waterloo
we do not belong to it
to us waterloo is but the stupefied date of liberty
that such an eagle should emerge from such an egg is certainly unexpected
if one place some's self at the cummins ring point of view of the question waterloo is intentionally a counter revolutionary victory
it is europe against france it is petersburg berlin and vienna against paris it is the status up against the initiative it is the th of july attacked through the th of march it is the monarchies clearing the decks in opposition to the indomitable french rioting
the final extinction of that vast people which had been in eruption for twenty six years such was the dream
the solidarity of the brunswick's the nassau's the roman offs the hohenzollern's the hapsburgs with the bourbons
waterloo bears divine right on it cd ripper
it is true that the empire having been despotic the kingdom by the natural reaction of things was forced to be liberal and that a constitutional order was the unwilling result of waterloo to the great regret of the conquerors
it is because revolution can not be really conquered and that being providential and absolutely fatal it is always cropping up a fresh before waterloo in bonaparte overthrowing the old thrones after waterloo in louis xviii
granting and conforming to the charter
bonaparte places a postilion on the throne of naples and a sergeant on the throne of sweden employing inequality to demonstrate equality louis xviii
at saint ouen counter signs the declaration of the rights of man
if you wish to gain an idea of what revolution is call it progress and if you wish to acquire an idea of the nature of progress call it tomorrow
tomorrow fulfils its work irresistibly and it is already fulfilling it today
it always reaches its goal strangely
it employs wellington to make of boy who was only a soldier an orator
fly balls at you go mont and rises again in the tribune
this does progress proceed
there is no such thing as a bad tool for that workman
it does not become disconcerted but adjusts to its divine work the man who has best ridden the alps and the good old tottering invalid of father elysee
it makes use of the youth man as well as of the conqueror of the conqueror with out of the youth jan within
waterloo by cutting short the demolition of european thrones by the sword had no other effect than to cause the revolutionary work to be continued in another direction
the slashers have finished it was the turn of the thinkers
the century that waterloo was intended to arrest has pursued its march
that sinister victory was vanquished by liberty
in short and incontestably that which triumphed at waterloo that which smiled in wellington's fear that which brought him all the marshals' staffs of europe including it is said the staff of a marshal of france that which joyously trundled the barrows full of bones to wrest the knoll of the lion that which triumphantly inscribed on that pedestal the date june that which encouraged blucher as he put the flying army to the sword that which from the heights of the plateau of mont saint jean hovered over france as over its prey was the counter revolution
it was the counter revolution which murmured that infamous word dismemberment
on arriving in paris it be held the crater close at hand it felt those ashes which scorched its feet and it changed its mind it returned to the stammer of a charter
let us behold in waterloo only that which is in waterloo
of intentional liberty there is none
the counter revolution was involuntarily liberal in the same manner as by a corresponding phenomenon napoleon was involuntarily revolutionary
ont meth of june the mounted robespierre was hurled from his saddle
chapter xviii are crud essence of divine right end of the dictatorship
a whole european system crumbled away
the empire sank into a gloom which resembled that of the roman world as it expired
again we behold the abyss as in the days of the barbarians only the barbs risk of which must be called by its pet name of the counter revolution was not long breathed soon fell to panting and halted short
the empire was he wept let us acknowledge the fact and he wept by heroic eyes
of glory lies in the sword converted into a sceptre the empire has been glory in person
it had diffused over the earth all the light which by fanny can give a sombre light
we will say more an obscure light
compared to the true daylight it is night
this disappearance of night produces the effect of an eclipse

and these things took place and the kings be aimed their thrones and the master of europe was put in a cage and the old regime became the new regime and all the shadows and all the light of the earth changes place because on the afternoon of a certain summer's data shepherd said to a prussian in the forest to this way and not that
this was a sort of lugubrious april
ancient unhealthy and poisonous realities were covered with new appearances
a lie wed dec the right divine was masked under a charter fictions became constitutional prejudices superstitions and mental reservations with article in the heart were varnished over with liberalism
it was the serpent's change of skin
man has been rendered both greater and smaller by napoleon
under this reign of splendid matter the ideal had received the strange name of ideology
it is a brave imprudence in a great man to turn the future into derision
the populace however that food for cannon which is so fond of the can no need sought him with its glance
where is he
what is he doing
napoleon is dead said a passerby to a veteran of marengo and waterloo
he dead
cried the soldier youdin't know him
imagination distrusted this man even when overthrown
the depths of europe were full of darkness after waterloo
something enormous remained long empty through napoleon's disappearance
the kings placed themselves in this void
ancient europe profited by it to undertake reforms
there was a holy alliance belle alliance beautiful alliance the fatal field of waterloo had said in advance
in presence and in face of that antique europe reconstructed the features of a new france were sketched out
the future which the emperor had rallied made its entry
on it's brow ignore the star liberty
the glowing eyes of all young generations were turned on it
singular fact
people were at one and the same time in love with the future liberty and the past napoleon
defeat had rendered the vanquished greater
bonaparte fallen seemed more lofty than napoleon erect
those who had triumphed were alarmed
england had him guarded by hudson lowe and france had him watched by mints menu
his folded arms became a source of uneasiness to thrones
alexander called him my sleeplessness
this terror was the result of the quantity of revolution which was contained in him
that is what explains and excuses final artist liberalism
this phantom causes the old world to tremble
the kings reigned but i lost their ease with the rock of saint helena on the horizon
while napoleon was passing through the death struggle at longwood the sixty thousand men who had fallen on the field of waterloo were quietly rotting and something of their peace was shed abroad over the world
the congress of vienna made the treaties in and europe called this the restoration
this is what waterloo was
but what matters it to the infinite
all that tempest all that cloud that war then that peace
all that darkness did not trouble for a moment the light of that immense eye before which shrub skipping from one blade of grass to another equals the eagle soaring from belfry to belfry on the towers of notre dame
chapter xix the battlefield at night let us return it is a necessity in this book to that fatal battlefield
ont meth of june the moon was full
its light favored boucher's ferocious pursuit betrayed the traces of the fugitives delivered up that disastrous mass to the eager prussian cavalry and aided the massacre
such tragic favors of the night do occur sometimes during catastrophes
after the last cannon's hot has been fired the plain of mont saint jean remained deserted
the english occupied the encampment of the french it is the usual sign of victory to sleep in the bed of the vanquished
they established their bivouac beyond ross on me
the prussians let loose on the retreating to it pushed forward
wellington went to the village of waterloo to draw up his report to lord bathurst
if ever thesis down on vobis was applicable it certainly is to that village of waterloo
waterloo took no part and pay half a league from the scene of action
mont saint jean was cannon a red you go mont was burned la baie sainte was taken by assault pa pr lotte was burned plan ceno it was burned la belle alliance be held the embrace of the two conquerors these names are hardly known and waterloo which worked not in the battle bears off all the honor
we are not of the number of those who flatter war when the occasion presents itself we tell the truth about it
war has frightful beauties which we have not concealed it has also we acknowledge some hideous features
one of the most surprising is the prompt stripping of the bodies of the dead after the victory
the dawn which follows a battle always rises on naked corpses
who does this
who thus soils the triumph
what hideous furtive hand is that which is slipped into the pocket of victory
what pickpockets are they wholly their trade in the rest of glory
some philosophers voltaire among the number affirm that it is precisely those persons have made the glory
it is the same men they say there is no relief corps those who are erect pillage those who are prone on the earth
the hero of the day of the vampire of the night
one has assuredly the right after all to strip a corpse a bit when one is the author of that corpse
for our own part we do not think so it seems to us impossible that the same hand should pluck laurels and our point he shoes from a deadman
one thing is certain which is that generally after conquerors follow thieves
but let us leave the soldier especially the contemporary soldier out of the question
every army has a rear guard and it is that which must be blamed
bat like creatures half brigands and lackeys all the sorts of vesper till is that that twilight called war engenders wearers of uniforms who take no part in the fighting pretended invalid's formidable limpets inter loping cutler's trotting along in little cards sometimes accompanied by their wives and stealing things which they sell again beggars offering themselves as guides to officers soldiers' servants marauders armies on the march in days gone by we are not speaking of the present dragged all this behind them so that in the special language they are called stranglers
no army no nation was responsible for those beings they spoke italian and followed the germans then spoke french and followed the english
it was by one of these wretches a spanish straggler who spoke french that the marquis offer vasquez received by his picard jargon and taking him for one of our own man was traitorous lys pain and robbed on the battlefield itself in the course of the night which followed the victory of cerl soles
the rascal sprang from this marauding
the detestable maxim live on the enemy
produced this leprosy which a strict discipline alone could heal
there are reputations which are deceptive one does not always know why certain general's great in other directions have been so popular
turenne was adored by his soldiers because he tolerated pillage evil permitted constitutes part of goodness
turenne was so good that he allowed the palatinate to be delivered over to fire and blood
the marauders in the train of an army were more or less in number according as the chief was more or less severe
his jeans marceau had no stragglers wellington had few and we do him the justice to mention it
nevertheless on the night from the thy it method june the dead were robbed
wellington was rigid he gave orders that anyone caught in the act should be shot but rapine is tenacious
the marauders's role in one corner of the battle field while others were being shot in another
the moon was sinister over this plain
towards midnight a man was prowling about or rather climbing in the direction of the hollow road o domain
to all appearance he was one of those whom we have just described neither english nor french neither peasant not soldier less a man than a ghoul attracted by the scent of the dead bodies having theft for his victory and come to rifle waterloo
he was clad in a blouse that was something like a great cost he was uneasy and audacious he walked forwards and gazed behind him
who was this man
the night probably knew more of him than the day
he had no sack but evidently he had large pockets under his coat
from time to time he halted scrutinized the plain around him as though to see whether he were observed bent over abruptly disturbed something silent and motionless on the ground then rose and fled
his sliding motion his attitudes his mysterious and rapid gestures caused him to resemble those twilight larvae which haunt ruins and which ancient norman legends call the al leurs
certain nocturnal wading birds produce these silhouettes among the marshes
a glance capable of piercing all that most deeply would have perceived at some distance a sort of little cutler's wagon with a fluted wicked good harnessed to a famished bag which was dropping the grass across its but as it halted hidden as it were behind the novel which adjoins the highway to give lies at the angle of the road from mont saint jean to brainsl' alleys and in the wagon a sort of woman seated on coffees and packages
perhaps there was some connection between that wagon and that prowler
the darkness was serene
not a cloud on the zenith
what matters it if the earth here d
the moon remains white these are the in differences of the sky
in the fields branches of trees broken by grape shot but not fallen upheld by their barossa her gently in the breeze of night
a breath almost a respiration moved the shrubbery
quivers which resembled the departure of souls ran through the grass
in the distance the coming and going of patrols and the general rounds of the english camp were audible
you go montand la baie sainte continued to burn forming one in the west the other in the east two great flames which were joined by the cordon of bivouac fires of the english like a necklace of rubies with two carbuncle's at the extremities as they extended in an immense semicircle over the hills along the horizon
we have described the catastrophe of the road o domain
the heart is terrified at the thought of what that death must have been to so many brave men
if there is anything terrible if there exists a reality which surpasses dreams it is this to live to see the sun to be in full possession of virile force to possess health and joy to laugh valiantly to rush towards a glory which one sees dazzling in front of one to feel in one's breast lungs which breathe a heart which beats a will which reasons to speak think hope love to have another to have a wife to have children to have the light and all at once in the space of a shout in less than a minute to sink into an abyss to fall to roll to crush to be crushed to see ears of wheat flowers leaves branches not to be able to catch hold of anything to feel one's sword useless men beneath one horses on top of one to struggle in vain since one's bones have been broken by some kick in the darkness to feel wheel which makes one's eyes start from their sockets to bite horses' shoes in one's rage to stifle to help to writhe to be beneath and to say to one's self but just a little while ago i was a living man
there where that lamentable disaster had uttered it's death rattle all was silence now
the edges of the hollow road were encumbered with horses and riders inextricably heaped up
terrible entanglement
there was no longer any slope for the corpses had levelled the road with the plain and reached the brim likes well filled bushel of barley
a heap of dead bodies in the upper part a river of blood in the lower part such was that road on the evening of the th of june
the blood ran even to the njdep lee highway and there overflowed in a large pool in front of the what is of trees which barred the way at a spot which is still pointed out
it will be remembered that it was at the opposite point in the direction of there maple road that the destruction of the cuirass legs had taken place
the thickness of the layer of bodies was proportioned to the depth of the hollow road
towards the middle at the point where it became level where report's division had passed the layer of corpses was thinner
the nocturnal prowler whom we have just shown to the reader was going in that direction
he was searching that vast tomb
he gazed about
he passed the dead in some sort of hideous review
he walked with his feet in the blood
all at once he paused
a few paces in front of him in the hollow road at the point where the pile of dead came to amend an open hand illumined by the moon projected from beneath that heap of men
that hand had on its finger something sparkling which was a ring of gold
the man bent over remained in a crouching attitude for a moment and when he rose there was no longer a ring on the hand
he did not precisely rose he remained in a stopping and frightened attitude with his back turned to the heap of dead scanning the horizon on his knees with the whole upper portion of his body supported on his two core fingers which rested on the earth and his head peering above the edge of the hollow road
the jackal's four paws suit some actions
then coming to a decision he rose to his feet
at that moment he gave a terrible start
he felt someone clutch him from gdb mgd
he wheeled found it was the open hand which had closed and had seized the skirt of his coat
an honest man would have been terrified this man burst into a laugh
come said he it's only a dead body
i prefer a spook to a gendarme
but the hand weakened and released him
effort is quickly exhausted in the grave
well now said the prowler is that dear fellow alive
let's see
he bent down again fumbled among the heap pushed aside everything that was in his way seized them and grasped the armed see the head pulled out the body and a few moments later he was dragging the lifeless or at least the unconscious man through the shadows of hollow road
he was a cuirass led an officer and even an officer of considerable ranks large holds paulette peeped from beneath the cuirass this officer no longer possessed a helmet
a furious sword such as scarred his face where nothing was discernible but blood
however he did not appear to have any broken limbs and by some happy chance of that word is permissible here the dead had been vaulted above him in such a manner as to preserve him from being crushed
his eyes were still closed
on his cuirass he wore the silver cross of the legion of honor
the prowler tore off this cross which disappeared into one of the rules which he had beneath his great coat
then he felt of the officer's bob discovered a watch there and took possession of it
next he searched his waistcoat found a purse and pocket edit
when he had arrived at this stage of succor which he was administering to this dying man the officer opened his eyes
thanks he said feebly
the abruptness of the movements of the man who was manipulating him the fresh news of the night the air which he could inhale freely had roused him from his lethargy
the prowler made no reply
he raised his head
a sound of footsteps was audible in the plain some patrol was probably approaching
the officer murmured for the death agony was still in his voice who won the battle
the english answered the prowler
the officer went on lookin my pockets you will find a watch and a piece
take them
it was already done
the prowler executed the required front and said there is nothing there
i have been robbed said the officer i am sorry for that
you should have had them
the steps of the patrol became more and more distinct
someone is coming said the prowler with the movement of a man who is taking his departure
the officer raised his arm feebly and detained him
you have saved my life
who are you
the prowler answered rapidly and in a low voice like yourself i belonged to the french army
i must leave you
if they were to catch me they would shoot me
i have saved your life
now get out of the scrape yourself
what is your rank
sergeant
what is your name
the barrier
i shall not forget that name said the officer and do you remember mine
my name is pont mercy
book second
the ship orion chapter i number becomes number jean valjean had been recaptured
the reader will be grateful to us if we pass rapidly over the sad details
we will confine ourselves to team scribing two paragraphs published by the journals of that day a few months after the surprising events which had taken place atm
shrm
these articles are rather summary
it must be remembered that at that epoch the gazette des tribune us was not yet in existence
we borrow the first from the drapeau blanc
it beats the date of july
an arrondissement of the pas de calais has just been the theatre of an event quite out of the ordinary course
a man who was a stranger in the department and who bore the name of m
madeleine has thanks to the new methods resuscitated some years ago an ancient local industry the manufacture of jet and of black glass trinkets
he had made his fortune in the business and that of the arrondissement as well we will admit
he had been appointed mayor in recognition of his services
the police discovered that m
madeleine was no other than an ex convict who had broken his ban condemned in for theft and named jean valjean
jean valjean has been're committed to prison
it appears that previous to his arrest he had succeeded in withdrawing from the hands of m
laffitte a sum of over half a million which he had lodged there and which he had moreover and by perfectly legitimate means acquired in his business
no one has been able to discover where jean valjean has concealed this money since his return to prison at toulon
the second article which enters a little more into detail is an extract from the journal de paris of the same date
a former convict who had been liberated named jean valjean has just appeared before the court of ad sizes of the bar under circumstances calculated to attract attention
this wretch had succeeded in escaping the vigilance of the police he had changed his name and had succeeded in getting himself appointed mayor of one of our small northern towns of this town he had established a considerable commerce
he has at last been unmasked and arrested thanks to the indefatigable zeal of the public prosecutor
he had for his concubine a woman of the town who died of a shock at the moment of his arrest
this scoundrel who is endowed with netsuke at strength found means to escape but three or four days after his flight the police laid their hands in him once more in paris itself at the very moment when he was entering one of those little vehicles which run between the capital and the village of mont vermeil seiner to use
he is said to have profited by this interval of three or four days of liberty to withdraw a considerable sum deposited by him with one of our leading bankers
this sum has been estimated at six or seven hundred thousand francs
if the indictment is to be trusted he has hidden it in some place known to himself alone and it has not been possible to lay hands on it
however that may be the said jean valjean has just been brought before the assizes of the department of the far as accused of highway robbery accompanied with violence about eight years ago on the person of one of those honest children who as the patriarch of ferney has said in immortal verse
arrive from savoy every year and who with gentle hands do clear those long canals choked up with so it
this bandit refused to defend himself
it was proved by the skilful and eloquent representative of the public prosecutor that the theft was committed in complicity with others and that jean valjean was a member of a band of robbers in the south
jean valjean was pronounced guilty and was condemned to the death penalty in consequence
this criminal refused to lodge an appeal
the king in his inexhaustible clemency has deigned to commute his penalty to that of penal servitude for life
jean valjean was immediately taken to the prison at toulon
the reader had not forgotten that jean valjean had religious habits atm
surg
some papers among others the constitutional presented this commutation as a triumph of the priestly party
jean valjean changed his number in the galleys
he was called
however and we will mention it at once in order that we may not be obliged to recur to the subject the prosperity of m
shrm
vanished with m
madeleine all that he had foreseen during his night of fever and hesitation was realized lacking him there actually was a soul lacking
after this fall there took place atm
shrm
that egotistical division of great existences which have fallen that fatal dismemberment of flourishing things which is accomplished every day obscurely in the human community and which history has noted only once because it occurred after the death of alexander
lieutenants are crowned king's superintendents in provide manufacturers out of themselves
envious rivalries a rose
m
madeleine's vast workshops were shut his buildings fell to ruin his workmen were scattered
some of them quitted the country other saba gained the trade
thenceforth everything was done on a small scale instead of on a grand scale for lucre instead of the general good
there was no longer a centre everywhere there was competition and animosity
j
madeleine had reigned over all and directed all
no sooner had ms sql lehrman each pulled things to himself the spirit of combat succeeded to the spirit of organization bitterness to cordiality hatred of one another to the benevolence of the founder towards all the threads which m
madeleine had set were tangled and broken the methods were adulterated the products were debased confidence was killed the market diminished for lack of orders salaries were reduced the workshops stood still bankruptcy arrived
and then there was not ning more for the poor
all had vanished
the state itself perceived that someone had been crushed somewhere
less than four years after the judgment of the court of assizes establishing the identity of jean valjean and m
madeleine for the benefit of the galleys the cost of collecting taxes had doubled in the arrondissement of m
shrm
and m
deville is called attention to the fact in the rostrum in the month of february
chapter ii in which the reader will peruse two verses which are of the devil's composition possibly before proceeding further it will be to the purpose to narrate in some details cingular occurrence which took place at about the same epoch in hong vermeil and which is not lacking in coincidence with certain conjectures of the indictment
there exists in the region of monte armful a very ancient superstition which is all the more curious and all the more precious because a popular superstition in the vicinity of paris is like an aloe in siberia
we are among those who respect everything which is in the nature of a rare plant
here then is the superstition of mont vermeil it is thought that the devil from time immemorial has selected the forest as a hiding place for his treasures
good wives affirm that it is no rarity to encounter at nightfall in secluded books of the forests black man with the air of a carter ira wood chipper wearing wooden shoes clad in trousers and a blouse of linen and recognizable by the fact that instead of a capo that he has two immense horns in his head
this ought in fact to render him recognizable
this man is habitually engaged in digging a hole
there are three ways of profiting by such an encounter
the first is to approach the man and speak to him
then it is seen that the man is simply a peasant that he appears black because it is nightfall that he is not digging any hole whatever but is cutting grass for his cows and that what had been taken for horns is nothing but a dung form which he is carrying on his back and whose teeth thanks to the perspective of evening seemed to spring from his head
the man returns home and dies within the week
the second way is to watch him to wait until he has dug his hole until he has filled it and has gone away them to run with great speed to the trench to open it once more and to seize the treasure which the black man has necessarily placed there
in this case one dies within the month
finally the last method is not to speak to the black men not to look at him and to flee at the best speed of one's legs
one then dies within the year
as all three methods are attended with their special inconveniences the second which at all events presents some advantages among others that of possessing a treasure if only for a month is the one most generally adopted
so bold men who are tempted by every chance have quite frequently as we are assured opened the holes excavated by the black man and tried to rob the devil
the success of the operation appears to be buy moderate
at least if the tradition is to be believed and in particular the two enigmatic so lines in barbarous latin which an evil norman monk a bit of a sorcerer named gryphon has left on this subject

accordingly enormous efforts are made
such trenches are ordinarily extremely deep am an sweats first oils all night for it must be done at night he sets his shirt burns out his candle breaks his mattock and when he arrives at the bottom of the hole when he lays his hand on the treasure what does he find
what is the devil's treasure

this is what gryphon's verses seem to announce to the indiscreet and curious to do get info swathes autos condi to pass as hmmm as lapides cadaver simulacra hi hi lake
it seems that in our day there is sometimes found a powderhorn with bullets sometimes an old pack of cards greasy and corn which has evidently served the devil
gryphon does not record these two finds since gryphon lived in the twelfth century and since the devil does not appear to have had the fit to invent powder before roger bacon's time and cards before the time of charles vi
moreover icons plays at cards on tue sure to lose all that one possesses
and as for the powder in the horn it possesses the property of making your gun burst in your face
how a very short time after the epoch when it seemed to the prosecuting attorney that the liberated convict jean valjean during his flight of several days had been prowling around mont vermeil it was remarked in that village that a certain old road labor renamed boulay ruelle had peculiar ways in the forest
people thereabouts thought they knew that this boulay ruelle had been in the galleys
he was subjected to certain police supervision and as he could find work nowhere the administration employed him at reduced rates as a road mender on the cross road from genny told gnu
this boulay fuelled as a man who was viewed with disfavor by the inhabitants of the districts stop respectful too humble too prompt in removing his cap to everyone and trembling and smoking in the presence of the gendarmes probably affiliated to robber bands they said suspected of lying in ambush at verge of closes at nightfall
the only thing in his favor was that he was a drunkard
this is what people thought they had noticed of late boulay ruelle had taken to quitting his task of stone breaking and care of the road at a very early hour and to be taking himself to the forest with his pickaxe
he was encountered towards evening in the most deserted clearings in the wildest thickets and he had the appearance of being in search of something and sometimes he was digging holes
the good wives who passed took him at first for beelzebub then they recognized boy lat ruelle and were not in the least be assured thereby
these encounters seemed to cause boulay ruelle a lively displeasure
it was evident that he sought to hide and that there was some mystery in what he was doing
it was said in the village it is clear that the devil has appeared
boulay ruelle has seen him and is on the search
in sooth he is cunning enough to pocket lucifer's board
the volta pro and added will nokia true low catch the devil or will the devil catch boulay ruelle
the old women made a great many signs of the cross
in the meantime boulay ruelle's manoeuvres in the forest ceased and he resumed his regular occupation of road mending and people gossiped of something else
some persons however we're still curious sur mixing that in all this there was probably no fabulous treasure of the legends but some fine windfall of a more serious and palpable sort than the devil's bank bills and that the road mender had half discovered the secret
the most puzzled were the schoolmaster and the barrier the proprietor of the tavern who was everybody's friend and had not disdained to ally himself with boulay ruelle
he has been in the galleys said the hardier
eh
good god
no one knows who has been there or will be there
one evening the schoolmaster affirmed that in former times the law would have instituted an inquiry as to what boulay fuelled is in the forest and that the latter would have been forced to speak and that he would have been put to the torture in case of need and that go up at ruelle would not have resisted the water test for example
let us put him to the winetest said the hardier
they made an effort and got the old road mender to drinking
you lat fuelled rank an enormous amount but said very little
he combined with admirable art and in masterly proportions the thirst of a form and user with the discretion of a judge
nevertheless by dint of returning to the charge and of comparing and putting together the few obscure words which he did allow to escape him this is what the barrier and the schoolmaster imagined that they had made out one morning when boulay ruelle was on his way to his work at daybreak he had been surprised to see at a book of the forest in the underbrush a shovel and a pickaxe concealed as one might say
however he might have supposed that they were probably the shovel and pick of father six fours the water carrier and would have thought no more about it
but on the evening of that day he saw without being seen himself as he was hidden by a large tree a person who did not belong in those parts and whom he boulay ruelle knew well directing his steps towards the densest part of the wood
translation by the barrier a comrade of the galleys
boulay ruelle obstinately refused to reveal his name
this person carries a package something square like a large box or a small trunk
surprise on the part of boulay ruelle
however it was only after the expiration of seven or eight minutes that the idea of following that person had occurred to him
but it was too late the person was already in the thicket night had descended and blu larry elle had not been able today chip with him
then he had adopted the course of watching for him at the edge of the woods
it was moonlight
two or three hours later boulay ruelle bad seen this person emerge from the brushwood carrying no longer the coffer but a shovel and pick
boulay ruelle had allowed the person to pass and had not dreamed of ad costing him because he said to himself that the other man was three times as strong as he was and armed with a pickaxe and that he would probably knock him over the head on recognizing him and on perceiving that he was recognized
touching effusion of two old comrades in meeting again
but the shovel and pick had served as a day of light to boil at ruelle he had hastened to the thicket in the morning and had found neither's how do not pick
from this he had drawn the inference that this person once in the forest had dug a hole with his pick buried the coffee and're closed the hole with his shovel
now the coffee was too small to contain a body therefore it contained money
hence his researches
boulay ruelle had explored sounded searched the entire forest and the thicker and had dug wherever the earth appeared to him to have been recently turned up
in vain
he had ferret scout nothing
no one in montrer mail thought any more about it
there were only a few brave gossips who said you may be certain that the mender on the nanny road did not take all that trouble for nothing he was sure that the devil had done
chapter iii the ankle chain must have undergone a certain preparatory manipulation to be thus broken with a blow from a hammer towards the end of october in that same year the inhabitants of toulon be held the entry into their port after heavy weather and for the purpose of repairing some damages of the ship orion which was employed later at great as a school ship and which then formed a part of the mediterranean squadron
this vessel battered as it was for the sea had handled it roughly produced a fine effect as it entered the roads
it flew some colors which provided for it the regulation salute of eleven guns which it returned shot for shot total twenty two
it has been calculated that what with salvos royal and military politeness es courteous exchanges of uproar sign also fetish edge formalities of roads heads and citadels sunrises and sunsets saluted every day by all fortresses and all ships of war openings and closings of ports etc.
the civilized world discharged all over the earth in the course of four and twenty hours one hundred and fifty thousand useless shots
at six francs the shot that comes to nine hundred thousand francs a day three hundred million's a year which vanish in smoke
this is a mere detail
all this time the poor were dying of hunger
the year was what the restoration called the epoch of the spanish war
this war contained many events in one and a quantity of peculiarities
age and family affair for the house of bourbon the branch of france su scoring and protecting the branch of madrid that is to say performing an act revolving on the elder an apparent return to our national traditions complicated by servitude and by subjection to the cabinets of the north m
le ducd' angouleme surnames by the liberal sheets the hero of andujar compressing in a triumphal attitude that was somewhat contradicted by his peaceable air the ancient and very powerful terrorism of the holy office at variance with the chimerical terrorism of the liberals the same culottes resuscitated to the great terror of dowager's under the name of sexcam is a dos monarchy opposing an obstacle to progress described as anarchy the theories of' roughly interrupted in the sap a european half called to the french idea which was making the tour of the world beside the son of france as generalissimo the prince de carignan afterwards charles albert enrolling himself in that crusade of kings against people as a volunteer with grenadier epaulets of red worsted the soldiers of the empire setting out on a fresh campaign but aged saddened after eight years of repose and under the white cock are the tricolored standard waved a broad by a heroic handful of frenchmen as the white standard has been thirty years earlier at coblentz monks mingled with our troops the spirit of liberty and of novelty brought to its senses by bayonets principles slaughtered by cannon area france undoing by her arms that which she had done by her mind in addition to this hostile leaders sold soldiers hesitating cities besieged by millions no military perils and yet possible explosions as in every mine which is surprised and invaded but little bloodshed little honors in shame for some glory for no one
such was this war made by the princes descended from louis xiv
and conducted by generals who had been under napoleon
it's sad fate was to recall neither the grand warm or grand politics
some feats of arms were serious the taking of the trocadero among others was a fine military action but after all we repeat the trumpets of this war give back a cracked sound the whole effect was suspicious history approves of france for making a difficulty about accepting this false triumph
it seemed evident that certain spanish officers charged with resistance yielded too easily the idea of corruption was connected with the victory it appears as though generals and not battles had been won and the conquer ing soldier returned humiliated
are basing eat in short in which the bank of france could be read in the folds of the flag
soldiers of the war of on whom saragossa had fallen in formidable ruin drowned in at the easy surrender of citadels and began to regret palafox
it is the nature of france to prefer to have to stop chine rather than ballesteros in front of her
from a still more serious point of view and one which it is also proper to insist upon here this war which sounded the military spirit of france enraged the democratic spirit
it was an enterprise or in the women t
in that campaign the object of the french soldier the son of democracy was the conquest of a good for others
a hideous contradiction
france is made to arouse the soul of nations not to stifle it
all the revolutions of europe since are the french revolution liberty darts days from france
that is a solar fact
blind is he who will not see
it was bonaparte who said it
the war of an outrage on the generous spanish nation was then at the same time an outrage on the french revolution
it was france who committed this monstrous violence by foul means for with the exception of ears of liberation everything that armies do is by foul means
the words passive obedience indicate this
an army is a strange masterpiece of combination where force results from an enormous sum of impotence
this is war made by humanity against humanity despite humanity explained
as for the bourbons the war of was fatal to them
they took it for a success
they did not perceive the danger that lies in having an idea slain to order
they went astray in their innocence to such a degree that they introduced the immense en feeble many of a crime into their establishment as an element of strength
the spirit of the ambush entered into their politics
had its term in
the spanish campaign became in their counsel's an argument for force and for adventures by right divine
france having reestablished el rey netto in spain might well have reestablished the absolute king at home
they fell into the alarming error of taking the obedience of the soldier for the consent of the nation
such confidence is the thin of thrones
it is not permitted to fall asleep either in the shadow of a machine dkgreen or in the shadow of an army
let us return to the ship orion
during the operations of the army commanded by the prince general is sooo a squadron had been cruising in the mediterranean
we have just stated that the orion belonged to this first and that accidents of the sea had brought it into port at toulon
the presence of a vessel of war in a post has something about it which attracts and engages a crowd
it is because it is great and the crowd loved what is great
a ship of the line is one of the most magnificent combinations of the genius of man with the powers of nature
a ship of the life is composed at the same time of the heaviest and the lightest of possible matter for it deals at one and the same time with three forms of substance solid liquid and fluid and it must do battle with all three
it has eleven class of iron with which to seize the granite on the bottom of the sea and more wings and more antennae than winged insects to catch the wind in the clouds
it's breath pours out through its hundred and twenty cannon was through enormous trumpets and replies proudly to the thunder
the ocean seeks to lead it astray in the alarming sameness of its follows but the vessel has its soul its compass which counsel sit and always shows it the north
in the blackest nights its lanterns supply the place of the stars
thus against the wind it has its cordage and its canvas against the water wood against the rocks its icon brass and lead against the shadows its light against immensity's needle
if one wishes to form an idea of all those gigantic proportions which taken as a whole constitute the ship of the line one has only to enter one of the six story covered construction stocks in the ports of brest or toulon
the vessels in process of construction are under a bell glass there as it were
this colossal beam is a yard that great column of wood which stretches out on the earth as far as the eye can reach is the main mast
taking it from its root in the stocks to its tip in the clouds it is sixty fathoms long and its diameter at its base is three feet
the english main mast rises to a height of two hundred and seventeen feet above the waterline
the navy of our fathers employed cables ours employs chains
the simple pile of chains on a ship of a hundred guns is four feet high twenty feet in breadth and eight feet in depth
and how much wood is required to make this shop
three thousand cubic metres
it is a floating forest
and moreover let this be borne in mind it is only a question here of the military vessel of forty years ago of the simple sailing vessels team then in its infancy has since added new miracles to that prodigy which is called a war vessel
at the present time for example the mixed vessel with a screw is a surprising machine propelled by three thousand square metres of canvas and by an engine of two thousand five hundred horsepower
not to mention these new marvels the ancient vessel of christopher columbus and of de ruyter is one of the masterpieces of man
it is as inexhaustible in force as is the infinite in gales it stores up the wind in its sails it is precise in the immense vagueness of the billows it floats and it reigns
there comes an hour nevertheless when the gale breaks that sixty foot yard like a straw when the wind beneath at mast four hundred feet tall when that anchor which weighs tens of thousands is twisted in the jaws of the waves like a fisherman's book in the jaws of spike when those monstrous cannon sutter plaintive and futile roads which the hurricane bears forth into the void and in tonight when all that power and all that majesty are engulfed in a power and i am wary which are superior
every time that immense force is displayed to culminate in an immense feebleness it affords men file for thought hence in the poet's curious people abound around these marvellous machines of war and of navigation without being able to explain perfectly to themselves why
everyday accordingly from morning until fight the quays sluices and the jetties of the port of toulon were covered with a multi tissot idlers and loungers as they say in paris whose business consisted in staring at the orion
the orion was a ship that had been ailing for a long time in the course of its previous cruises thick layers of barnacles had collected on its keep to such a degree as to deprive it or half its speed it had gone into the drydock the year before this in order to have the barnacles scraped off then it had put to sea again but this cleaning had affected the bolts of the keel in the neighborhood of the balearic isles the sides had been strained and had opened and as the playing in those days was not of sheet or on the vessel had sprung a leak
a violent equinoctial gale had come up which had first staged in a grating and a porthole on the lar board side and damaged the fore top gallant shrouds in consequence of these injuries the orion had run back to toulon
it anchored near the arsenal it was fully equipped and repairs were begun
the hull had received no damage on the starboard but some of the planks had been in nailed here and there according to custom to permit of air entering the gold
one morning the crowd which was gazing at it witnessed an accident
illustration the ship orion an accident b. the ship orion the crew was busy bending the sails the top man who had to take the upper corner of the main topsail on the starboard lost his balance he was seen to waver the multitude thronging the arsenal quay uttered a cry the man's head over balanced his body the man fell around the yard with his hands outstretched towards the abyss on his way he seized the foot good first with one hand them with the other and remained hanging from it the sea lay below him at a dizzy depth the shock of his fall had impacted to the foot rope a violent swinging motion the man swayed back and for that the end of that rope like a stone in a sling
it was incurring a frightful risk to go to his assistance not one of the sailors all fishermen of the coast recently levied for the service dated to attempt it
in the meantime the unfortunate top man was losing his strength his anguish could not be discerned in his face but his exhaustion was visible in every limb his arms were contracted in horrible twitching's every effort which he made to read send served but to augment the oscillations of the foot dope he did not shout for fear of exhausting his strength
all were awaiting the minute when he should release his hold on the role and from instant to instant heads were turned aside that his fall might not be seen
there are moments when a bit of rope a pole the branch of a tree is life itself and it is a terrible thing to see a living being detach himself from it and talk like a ripe fruit
all at once a man was seen climbing into the rigging with the ability of a tigers at this man was dressed in red he was a convict he wore a green cap he was a life convict
on arriving on a level with the top a gust of wind carried away his cap and allowed a perfectly whitehead to be seen he was not a young man
a convict employed on board with a detachment from the galleys had in fact at the very first instant hastened to the officer of the watch and in the midst of the consternation and the hesitation of the crew while all the sailors were trembling and drawing back he had asked the officer's permission to risk his life to save the top man at an affirmative sign from the officer he had broken the chain riveted to his ankle with one blow of a hammer then he had caught up scope and had washed into the rigging no one noticed at the instant with what ease that chain had been broken it was only later on that the incident was recalled
in a twinkling he was on the yard he paused for a few seconds and appeared to be measuring it with his eye these seconds during which the breeze swayed the top man at the extremity of a threat seemed centuries to those who were looking on
at last the convict raised his eyes to heaven and advanced a step the crowd drew a long breath
he was seen to run out along the yard on arriving at the point he fastened the rope which he had brought to it and allowed the other end to hang down then he began to descend the role hand over hand and then and the anguish was indescribable instead of one man suspended over the gulf there were two
one would have said it was a spider coming to seize a fly only here the spider brought life not death
ten thousand glances were fastened on this group not a cry not a word the same tremor contracted every brow all mouths held their breath as though they feared to add the slightest puff to the wind which was swaying the two unfortunate men
in the meantime the convict had succeeded in lowering himself to a position near the sailor
it was high time one minute more and the exhausted and despairing man would have allowed himself to fall into the abyss
the convict had moored him securely with the cord to which he clung with one hand while he was working with the other
at last he was seen to climb back on the yard and to drag the sailor up after him he held him there a moment to allow him to recover his strength then he grasped him in his arms and carried him walking on the yard himself to the cap and from there to the main too where he left him in the hands of his comrades
at that moment the crowd broke into applause old convict sergeants among them wept and women embraced each other on the quay and all voices were heard to cry with a sort of tender rate pardon for that man
he in the meantime had immediately begin to make his descent to rejoin his detachment
in order to reach them the more speedily he dropped into the rigging and ran along one of the lower yards all eyes were following him
at a certain moment fear assailed them whether it was that he was fatigue for that his head turned they thought they saw him hesitate and stagger
all at once the crowd uttered a loud about the convict had fallen into the sea
the fall was perilous
the frigate algeciras was anchored alongside the orion and the poor convict had fallen between the two vessels it was to be feared that he would slip under one of the other of them
four men flung themselves hastily into a boat the crowd cheered them on anxiety again took possession of all souls the man had not risen to the surface he had disappeared in the sea without leaving a ripple as though he had fallen into a cask of oil they sounded they diver
in vain
the search was continued until the evening they did not even find the body
on the following day the toulon newspaper printed these lines job
yesterday a convict belonging to the detachment on board of the orion on his return from rendering assistance to a sailor fell into the sea and was drowned
the body has not yet been found it is supposed that it is dh tangled among the piles of the arsenal point this man was committed under the number and his name was jean valjean
book third
accomplishment of the promise made to the dead woman chapter i. the water question at mont vermeil mont vermeil is situated between live hand chelles on the southern edge of that lofty table land which separates the our cq from the marne
at the present day it is a tolerably large town ornamented all the year through with plaster villas and on sundays with beaming bourgeois
in there were at mont vermeil neither so many white house's not so many well satisfied citizens it was only a village in the forest
some pleasure houses of the last century were to be met with there to be sure which were recognizable by their grand air their balconies in twisted iron and their long windows whose tiny pages cast all sorts of varying shades of green in the white of the closed shutters but mont vermeil was nonetheless a village
retired cloth merchants and rustic aging attorneys had not discovered it as yet it was a peaceful and charming place which was not on the road to anywhere there people lived and cheaply that peasant rustic life which is so bounteous and so easy only water was rare there on account of the elevation of the plateau
it was necessary to fetch it from a considers for distance the end of the village towards havnt drew its water from the magnificent ponds which exist in the woods there
the other end which side pines the church and which lies in the direction of chelles found drinking water only at a little spring halfway down the slope near the road rochelle's about a quarter of an hour from mont vermeil
thus each household found it hard work to keep supplied with water
the large houses the aristocracy of which the then are per tavern formed a part paid half a farthing a bucket ful to a man who made a business of it and who earned about righteous a day in his enterprise of supplying none vermeil with water but this goodman only worked until seveno'clock in the evening in summer and five in winter and night once come and the shutters on the ground floor once closed he who had no water to drink went to fetch it for himself or die without it
this constituted the terror of the poor creature whom the reader has probably not forgotten little cosette
it will be remembered that cosette was useful to the the barriers in two ways they made the mother pay them and they made the child serve them
so when the mother ceased to pay altogether the reason for which we have read in preceding chapters the the barrier slept cosette
she took the place of a servant in their house
in this capacity she it was who ran to fetch water when it was required
so the child who was greatly terrified at the idea of going to the spring at night took great care that water should never be lacking in the house
christmas of the year was particularly brilliant at mont vermeil
the beginning of the winter had been mild there had been neither shown or frost up to that time
some mounts banks from paris had obtained permission of the mayor to erect their booths in the principal street of the village and a band of itinerant merchants under protection of the same tolerance had constructed their stalls on the church square and even extended them into boulanger alley whereas the reader will perhaps remember the the barriers' hostelry was situated
these people filled the inns and drinking shops and communicated to that tranquil little districts noisy and joyous life
in order to play the part of a faithful historians sought even to add that among the curiosities displayed in the square there was a menagerie in which frightful clowns clad in rags and coming no one knew whence exhibited to the peasants of mint vermeil in one of those horrible brazilian cultures such as our royal museum did not possess until and which have a tricolored cock are for an eye
i believe that naturalists call this bird cars car apply for us it belongs to the order of the api codes and to the family of the vultures
some good old bona parti at soldiers who had retired to the village went to see this creature with great devotion
the mounts banks gave out that the tricolored cockaded as a unique phenomenon made by god expressly for their menagerie
on christmas eve itself a number of men carter's and peddlers were seated at table drinking and smoking around four or five candles in the public room of the hardier's hostelry
this room resembled all drinking shop rooms tables pewter jugs bottles drinkers smokers but little light and a great deal of noise
the date of the year was indicated nevertheless by two objects which were then fashionable in the bourgeois class to wit a kaleidoscope and a lamp of rubber tin
the female the barrier was attending to the supper which was roasting in front of a clear fire her husband was drinking with his customers and talking politics
besides political conversations which had for their principal subjects the spanish war and m

cosette was in her usual place seated on the crossbar of the kitchen table near the chimney
she was in rats her bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes and by the firelight she was engaged in knitting woollen stockings destined for the young the bar doers
a very young kitten was playing about among the chairs
laughter and charter were audible in the adjoining room from two fresh children's voices it was soon i brands selma
in the chimney corners dato' nine tails was hanging on a nail
at intervals the cry or a very young child which was somewhere in the house rang through the noise of the dram shop
it was a little boy who had been born to the the barriers during one of the preceding winters she did not know why she said the result of the cold and who was a little more than three years old
the mother had nursed him but she did not love him
when the persistent clamor of the best became too annoying your son is equalling the barrier would say so go and see what he wants
bah
the mother would reply be bothers me
and the neglected child continued to shriek in the dark
chapter ii two complete portraits so far in this book the the barriers have been viewed only on profile the moment has arrived for making the circuit if this couple and considering it under all its aspects
the barrier had just passed his fiftieth birthday madame the barrier was approaching her forties which is equivalent to fifty in a woman so that there existed a balance of age between husband and wife
our readers have possibly preserved some recollection of this the barrier woman ever since her first appearance tall blonde edgar angular square enormous and while she belonged as we have said to the ease of those colossal wild women who comfort themselves affairs with paving stones hanging from their hair
she did everything about the house made the beds did the washing the cooking and everything else
cosette washer only servant a mouse in the service of an elephant
everything trembled at the sound of her voice window panes furniture and people
her big face dotted with red blotches presented the appearance of a skimmer
she had a beard
she was an ideal market porter dressed in woman's clothes
she swore splendidly chebi acres of being able to crack a nut with one blow other fish
except for the romances which she had read and which made the affected lady peep through the ogre's's at times in a very queer day the idea would never have occurred to anyone to say other than is a woman
this the barrier female was like the product of a web chen grafted on a fish wife
when one heard her speak one said that is a gendarme when one saw her drink one said that is a carter when one saw her hand le cose the one said that is the hangman
one of her teeth projected when her face was in repose
the barrier was a small thin pale angular bony feeble man who had a sickly air and who was wonderfully healthy
his cunning began her she smiled habitually by way of precaution and was almost polite to everybody even to the beggar to whom he refused half a farthing
he had the glance of a poor cat and the hearing of a man of letters
he greatly resembled the portraits of the abbe de lille
misco que try consisted in drinking with the carters
no one had ever succeeded in rendering him drunk
he smoked a bitpipe
he wore a blouse and under his blouse an old black coat
he made pretensions to literature and to materialism
there were certain names which he often pronounced to support whatever things he might be saying voltaire raynal party and sinful a fly enough saint augustine
he declared that he had a system
in addition he was a great swindler
a filius o phe philoso phe a scientific thief
the species does exist
it will be remembered that he pretended to have served in the army he was in the habit of relating with exuberance now being a sergeant in the thor the thought something or other at waterloo he had alone and in the presence of a squadron of death dealing hussars covered with his body and saved from death in the midst of the grapes not a general who had been dangerously wounded
thence arose for his walk the flaring sign and for hiding the name which it bore in the neighborhood of the cabaret of the sergeant of waterloo
he was a liberal a classic and afonso artist
he had subscribed for the champs's sole
it was said in the village that he had studied for the priesthood
we believe that he had simply studied in holland for an innkeeper
this rascal of composite order was in all probability some fleming from lille in flanders a frenchman in paris a belgian at brussels being comfortably astride of both frontiers
as for his prowess at waterloo the reader is already acquainted with that
it will be perceived that he exaggerated or a trifle
ebb and flow wandering adventure was the leven of his existence a tattered conscience entails a fragmentary life and apparently at the stormy epoch of june then sexier belonged to that variety of marauding cutlers of which we have spoken beating about the country selling to some stealing from others and travelling like a family man with wife and children in a rickety cart in the rear of troops on the march with an instinct for always attaching himself to the victorious army
this campaign ended and having as he said some quibus he had come to mony vermeil and setup an inn there
this quibus composed of purses and watches of gold rings and silver crosses gathered in harvest time in furrows down with corpses did not amount to a large total and did not carry this sut i returned eating housekeeper very far
the barrier had that peculiar rectilinear something about his gestures which accompanied by an oath recalls the barracks and by a sign of the cross the seminary
he was a fine talker
he allowed it to be thought that he was an educated man
nevertheless the schoolmaster had noticed that he pronounced improperly
he composed the travellers' tariff card in a superior manner but practices eyes sometimes spied out orthographic al errors in it
the barrier was cunning greedy slothful and clever
he did not discs in his servants which caused his wife to dispense with them
this giantess was jealous
it seemed to her that that thin and yellow little man must be an object covered by all
the barrier who was above all an astute and well balanced man was a scamp of a temperate sort
this is the worst species hypocrisy enters into it
it is not that the barrier was not on occasion capable of death to quite the same degree as his wife but this was very rare and at such times since he was engaged with the human race in general as before within him a deep furnace of hatred
and since he was one of those people who are continually avenging their wrongs who accuse everything that passes before them of everything which has befallen the maid who are always ready to cast upon the first person who comes to hand as a legitimate grievance the sum total of the deceptions the bankruptcies and the calamities of their lives when all this leaven was stirred up in him and boiled forth from his mouth and eyes he was terrible
woe to the person who came under his wrath at such a time
in addition to his other qualities the barrier was attentive and penetrating silent or talkative according to circumstances and always highly intelligent
he had something of the look of sailors who are accustomed to screw up their eyes to gaze through marine glasses
the barrier was a statesman
every newcomers to entered the tavern said on catching sight of madame the barrier there is the master of the house
a mistake
she was not even the mistress
the husband was both master and mistress
she worked he created
he directed everything by a sort of invisible and constant magnetic action
a word was sufficient for him sometimes a sign the mastodon obeyed
the barrier was a sort of special and sovereign being in madame the barrier's eyes though she did not thoroughly realize it
she was possessed of virtues after her own mind if she had ever had a disagreement as to any detail with monsieur the barrier which was an inadmissible hypothesis by the way she would not have blamed her husband in public on any subject whatever
she would never have committed before strangers that mistake so often committed by women and which is called in parliamentary language exposing the crown
although their concord had only evil as its result there was contemplation in madame the barrier's submission to her husband
that mountain of noise and of flesh moved under the little finger of that frail despot
viewed on its dwarfed and grotesque side this was that grand and universal thing the adoration of mind by matter for certain ugly features have a cause in the very depths of eternal beauty
there was an unknown quantity about them at diff hence the absolute empire of the man over that woman
at certain moments she beheld him like a lighted candle at others she felt him like a claw
this woman was a formidable creature who loved no one except her children and who did not fear anyone except her husband
she was another because she was man move to us
but her maternity stopped short with her daughters and as we shall see did not extend to boys
the man had but one thought how to enrich himself
he did not succeed in this
a theatre worthy of this great talent was lacking
then at diet was ruining himself at mont vermeil if ruin is possible to zero in switzerland or in the pyrenees this penniless scamp would have become a millionaire but an innkeeper must browse where fate has hitched him
it will be understood that the wording keeper is here employed in a restricted sense and does not extend to an entire class
in this same year the married was burdened with about fifteen hundred francs' worth of petty debts and this rendered him anxious
whatever may have been the obstinate injustice of destiny in this case the nerdier was one of those men who understand best with the most profundity and in the most modern fashion that thing which is a virtue among barbarous peoples and an object of merchandise among civilized peoples hospitality
besides he was an admirable poacher and quotes for his skill in shooting
he had a certain cold and tranquil laugh which was particular my dangerous
his theories as a landlord sometimes burst forth in lightning flashes
he had professional aphorisms which he inserted into his wife's mind
the duty of the innkeeper he said to her one day violently and in a low voice is to sell to the first come rates are pose light fired if they were a servant life and a smile to stop passersby to empty small purses and to honestly lighten heavy ones to shelter travelling families respectfully to share the man to pluck the woman to pick the child clean to quote the window open the windows but the chimney corner the armchair the chair the ottoman the stool the featherbed the mattress and they rise of straw to know how much the shadow uses up the mirror and to put a price on it and by five hundred thousand devils to make the traveller pay for everything even for the flies which his dog eat a
this man and this woman were rude and rage wedded a hideous and terrible team
while the husband pondered and combined madame the barrier thought not of absent creditors took no need of yesterday nor of tomorrow and lived in a bit of anger all in a minute
such were these two beings
cosette was between them subjected to their double pressure like a creature who is at the same time being ground up in a mill and pulled to pieces with pincers
the man and the woman each had a different method cosette was overwhelmed with blows this was the woman's she went barefooted in winter that was the man's doing
rosette ran upstairs and down washed swept rubbed ducted fan fluttered about panted moved heavy articles and weak as she was did the coarse work
there was no mercy for her a fierce mistress and venomous master
that he had diet hostelry was like a spider's web in which cosette had been taught and where she lay trembling
the ideal of oppression was realized by this sinister household
it was something like the fly serving the spiders
the poor child passively he or her peace
what takes place within these souls when they have but just quitted god find themselves thus at the very dawn of life very small and in the midst of men all naked
chapter iii men must have wine and horses must have water four new travellers had arrived
cosette was meditating sadly for although she was only eight years old she had already suffered so much that she reflected with the lugubrious air of an old woman
here he was black in consequence of a glow from madame the barrier's fist which caused the latter to remark from time to time his ugly she is with her fist blow on her eye
cosette was thinking that it was dark very dark that the pitchers and car acres in the chambers of the travellers who had arrived must have been filled and that there was no more water in the cistern
she was somewhat reassured because no one in the the barrier establishment drank much water
thirsty people were never lacking there but their thirst was of the sort which applies to the jun rather than to the pitcher
anyone who had asked for a glass of water among all those glasses of wine would have appeared a savage to all these men
but there came a moment when the child trembled madame the barrier raised the cover of a sheep am which was boiling on the stove then seized a glass and briskly approached the cistern
she turned the faucet the child had raised her head and was following all the woman's movements
a thin stream of water trickled from the faucet and half filled the glass
well said she there is no more water
a momentary silence ensued
the child did not breathe
bah
resumed made me the barrier examining the half filled glass this will be enough
cosette applied herself to her work once more but for a quarter of an hour she felt her heart leaping in her bosom like a big snowflake
she counted the minutes that passed in this manner and wished it were the next morning
from time to time one of the drinkers looked into the street and exclaimed it's as black as an oven
or one must needs be a day to go about the streets without a lantern at this hour
and cosette trembled
all at once one of the leclerc who lodged in the hostelry entered and said in a harsh voice my horse has not been watered
yes it has said madame the barrier
i tell you that it has not retorted the peeler
cosette had emerged from under the table
oh yes sir
said she the horse has had a drink he drank out of a bucket a whole bucket ful and it was i who took the water to him and i spoke to him
it was not true cosette lied
there's a brat as big as my fist who tells lies as big as the house exclaimed the peeler
i tell you that he has not been watered you little jade
he has a way of blowing when he has had no water which i know well
cosette persisted and added in a voice rendered hoarse with anguish and which was barely audible and he drank heartily
come said the pedler in a rate thiswon't do at all let my horse be watered and let that be the end of it
cosette crept under the table again
in truth that is fair
said madame the barrier of the beast has not been watered it must be
then glancing about her well now
where's that other beast
she bent down and discovered cosette cowering at the other end of the table almost under the drinkers' feet
are you coming
shrieked madame the barrier
cosette crawled out of the sort of hole in which she had hidden herself
the then a rdiff resumed mademoiselle dog lack name go and water that horse
but madame said cosette feebly there is no water
the the barrier threw the street door wide open well giant get some then
cosette dropped her head and went for an empty bucket which stood near the chimney corner
this bucket was bigger than she was and the child could have set down in it at her face
the the barrier returned to her stove and tasted what was in the crew pan with a wooden spoon grumbling the while there's plenty in the spring
there never was such a malicious creature as that
i think i should have done better to strain my onions
then she rummaged in a drawer which contained some pepper and shallots
see here man's role to as she added on your way back you will get a big load from the baker
here'sa fifteen do i piece
cosette had a little pocket on one side of her apron she took the coin without saying a word and put it in that pocket
then she stood motionless bucket in hand the open door before her
she seemed to be waiting for someone to come to her rescue
get along with you
screamed the then archer
cosette went out
the door closed behind her
chapter iv entrance on the scene of a doll the line of open air booths starting at the church extended as the reader will remember as far as the hostelry of the the barriers
these booths were all illuminated because the citizens would soon pass on their way to the midnight mass with candles burning in paper funnels which as the schoolmaster then seated at the table at the the mardi gra' observed produced a magical effect
in compensation not a star was visible in the sky
the last of these stalls established precisely opposite the the barriers' door was a toy shop all glittering with tinsel glass and magnificent objects of tin
in the first row and far forwards the merchant had placed on a background of white napkins an immense doll nearly two feet high who was dressed in adobe of pink crepe with gold wheatear's on her head which had real hair and enamel eyes
all that way this marvel had been displayed to the wonderment of all passersby under ten years of age without a mother being found in hong vermeil sufficiently rich or sufficiently extravagant to give it to her child
epo nine and a selma had passed hours in contemplating it and cosette herself had ventured to cast a glance at it on the sky it is true
at the moment when cosette emerged bucket inn and melancholy and overcome as she was she could not refrain from lifting her eyes to that wonderful doll towards the lady as she called it
the poor child paused in amazement
she had not yet be held that will close to
the whole shop seemed a palace to her the doll was not a doll it was a vision
it was not splendor riches happiness which appeared in a sort of chimerical halo to that unhappy little being so profoundly engulfed in gloomy and chilly misery
with the sad and innocent sagacity of childhood cosette measured the abyss which separated her from that doll
she said to herself that one must be a queen or at least a princess to have a thing like that
she gazed at that beautiful pink dress that beautiful smooth hair and she thought how happy that doll must be
she could not take her eyes from that fantastic stall
the more she looked the more dazzled she grew
she thought she was gazing at para diet
there were other folks behind the large one which seemed to her to be fairies and genii
the merchant who was pacing back and forth in front of his shop produced on her somewhat the effect of being the eternal father
in this adoration she forgot everything even the errand with which she was charged
all at once the the barrier's coarse voice recalled her to reality what you silly jade
you have not gone
wait
i'll give it to you
i want to know what you are doing there
get a long you little monster
the then we do we had cast a glance into the street and had caught sight of cosette in her ecstasy
cosette fled dragging her paul and taking the longest strives of which she was capable
chapter v. the little one all alone as the the barrier hostelry was in that part of the village which is near the church it was to the spring in the forest in the direction of chelles that cosette was obliged to go for her water
she did not glance at the display of a single other merchant
so long as she was in boulanger lane and in the neighborhood of the church the lighted stalls illuminated the road but so on the last light from the last stall vanished
the poor child found herself in the dark
she plunged into it
only as a certain emotion overcame her she made as much motion as possible with the handle of the bucket as she walked along
this made a noise which afforded her company
the further she went the denser the darkness became
there was no one in the streets
however she did encounter a woman who turned around on seeing her and stood still muttering between her teeth where can that child be going
is it a werewolf child
then the woman recognized cosette
well said she it's the park
in this manner cosette traversed the labyrinth of tortuous and deserted streets which terminate in the village of hong vermeil on the side of chelles
so long as she had the houses or even the walls only on both sides of her oath she proceeded with tolerable boldness
from time to time she caught the flicker of a candle through the crack of a shutter this was light and life there were people there and it reassured her
but in proportion as she advanced her pace slackened mechanically as it were
when she had passed the corner of the last house cosette paused
it had been hard to advance further than the last stall it became impossible to proceed further than the last house
she set her bucket on the ground thrust her hand into her hair and began slowly to scratch her head a gesture peculiar to children when terrified and undecided what to do
it was no longer mont vermeil it was the open fields
black and desert space was before her
she gazed in despair at that darkness where there was no longer any one where there were beasts where there were spectres possibly
she took a good look and heard the beasts walking on the grass and she distinctly saddle trees moving in the trees
then she seized her bucket again fear had lent her audacity
bay
said she i will tell him that there was no more water
and she resolutely reentered mont vermeil
hardly had she gone a hundred paces when she paused and began to scratch her head again
now it was the the barrier who appeared to her with her hideous hyena mouth and wrath flashing in her eyes
the child cast a melancholy glance before her and behind her
what was due to do
what was to become other
where was due to go
in front of her was the spectre of the the barrier behind her all the phantoms of the night and of the forest
it was before the the barrier that she recoiled
she resumed her path to the spring and began to run
she emerged from the village she entered the forest at a run no longer looking at or listening to anything
she only paused intercourse when her breath failed her but she did not halt in her advance
she went straight before her in desperation
as she ran she felt like crying
the nocturnal quivering of the forest surrounded her completely
she no longer thought she no longer saw
the immensity of night was fading this tiny creature
on the one hand all shadow on the other an atom
it was only seven or eight minutes' walk from the edge of the woods to the spring
cosette knew the way through having gone over it many times in daylight
strange to say she did not get lost
a remnant of instinct guided her vaguely
but she did not turn her eyes either to right or to left for fear of seeing things in the branches and in the brushwood
in this manner she reached the spring
it was a narrow natural gas in hollowed out by the water in a clayey soil about two feet deep surrounded with moss and with those tall crimped grasses which are called henry iv
's frills and paved with several large stones
a brook ran out of it with a tranquil little noise
cosette did not take time to breathe
it was very dark but she was in the habit of coming to this spring
she felt with her left hand in the dark for a young oak which leaned over the spring and which usually served to support her found one of its branches clung to it bent down and plunged the bucket in the water
she was in a state of such violent excitement that her strength was trebled
while this bent over she did not notice that the pocket of her apron had emptied itself into the spring
the fifteen so i piece fell into the water
cosette neither was not heard it fall
she drew out the bucket nearly full and set it on the grass
that done she perceived that she was worn out with fatigue
she would have liked to set out again at once but the effort required to fill the bucket had been such that she found it impossible to take a step
she was forced to sit down
she dropped on the grass and remained crouching there
she shut her eyes then she opened them again without knowing why but because she could not do otherwise
the agitated water in the bucket beside her was describing circles which resembled tin serpents
overhead the sky was covered with vast black clouds which were like masses of smoke
the tragic mask of shadow seemed to bend vaguely over the child
jupiter was setting in the depths
the child shared with bewildered eyes at this great star with which she was unfamiliar and which terrified her
the planet was in fact very near the horizon and was traversing a dense layer of most which imparted to its horrible ruddy his
the most gloomily em purples magnified the star
one would have called it a luminous sound
a cold wind was blowing from the play m
the forest was dark not a leaf was moving there were none of the vague fresh gleams of summer tide
great boughs uplifted themselves in frightful wise
slender and misshapen bushes whistles in the clearings
the tall grasses in an later like eels under the north wind
the nettles seemed to twist long arms furnished with claws in search of prey
some bits of dry heather tossed by the breeze blew rapidly by and had the air of fleeing in terror before something which was coming after
on all sides there were lugubrious stretches
the darkness was bewildering
man requires light
whoever buried himself in the opposite of day feels his heart contract
when the eye sees black the year users trouble
in an eclipse in the night in the sport opacity there is anxiety even for the shouted to the arts
no one walks alone in the forest at night without trembling
shadows and trees two formidable densities
a chi medical reality appears in the indistinct depths
the inconceivable is outlined a few paces distant from you with a spectral clearness
one beholds floating either in space or in one's own brain one knows not what vague and intangible thing like the dreams of sleeping flowers
there are fierce attitudes on the horizon
one inhaled the effluvia of the great black void
one is afraid to glance behind him yet desirous of doing so
the cavities of night things grown man made taciturn profiles which vanish when one advances obscured is bevel ments irritated tufts livid pools the lugubrious reflected in the funereal the sepulchral immensity of silence unknown but possible being an endings of mysterious branches alarming torsos of trees kong handfuls of quivering plants against all this one has no protection
there is no hardihood which does not shudder and which does not feel the vicinity of anguish
one is conscious of something hideous as though one's soul were becoming amalgamated with the darkness
this penetration of the shadows is indescribably sinister in the case of a child
forests are apocalypse said the beating of the rings of a tiny soul produces a sound of agony beneath their monstrous vault
without understanding her sensations cosette was conscious that she was seized upon by that black enormity of nature it was no longer terror alone which was gaining possession of her it was something more terrible even than terror she shivered
there are no words to express the strangeness of that shiver which chilled her to the very bottom of her heart here he grew wild she thought she felt that she should not be able to refrain from returning there at the same hour on the morrow
then by a sort of instinct she began to count a lot done two three four and soon up to ten in order to escape from that singular state which she did not under stand but which terrified her and when she had finished she began again this restored her to a true perception of the things about her
her hands which she had set in drawing the water felt cold she rose her terror a natural and unconquerable terror had returned she had but one thought how to flee at full speed through the forest across the fields to the houses to the windows to the lighted candles
her glance fell upon the water which stood before her such was the bright which the the barrier inspired in her that she dared not flee without that bucket of water she seized the handle with both hands she could hardly lift the pail
in this manner she advanced a dozen paces buy the bucket was fill it was heavy she was forced to set it on the ground once more
she took breath for an instant then lifted the handle of the bucket again and resumed her march proceeding a little further this time but again she was obliged to pause
after some seconds of repose she set out again
she walked bent forward with dropping headline an old woman the weight of the buckets trained and stiffened berth in arms
the iron handle completed the be numbing and freezing of her wet and tiny hands she was forced to halt from time to time and each time that she did so the cold water which splashed from the pail fell on her bare legs
this took place in the depths of a forest at night in winter far from all human sight she was a child of eight no one but god saw that sad thing at the moment
and her mother no doubt alas
for there are things that make the dead open their eyes in their grades
she panted with a sort of painful rattle so be contracted her throat but she dared not weep so afraid was she of the the barrier even at a distance in washer custom to imagine the the barrier always present
however she could not make much headway in that manner and she went on very slowly
in spite of diminishing the length of her stops and of walking as long as possible between them she reflected with anguish that it would take her more than an hour to return to mont vermeil in this manner and that the then archer would heather
this anguish was mingled with her terror at being alone in the woods at night she was worn out with fatigue and had not yet emerged from the forest
on arriving near an old chestnut tree with which she was acquainted made a last half longer than the rest in order that she might get well rested the name summoned up all her strength picked up her bucket again and courageously resumed her march but the poor little desperate creature could not refrain from drying o my god
my god
at that moment she suddenly became conscious that her bucket no longer weighed anything at allah and which seemed to her enormous had just seized the handle and lifted it vigorously
she raised her head
a large black form straight and erect was walking beside her through the darkness it was a man who had come up behind her and whose approach she had not heard
this man without uttering a word had seized the handle of the bucket which she was carrying
there are instincts for all the encounters of life
the child was not afraid
chapter vi which possibly proves boulay ruelle's intelligence on the afternoon of that same christmas day a man had walked for rather a long time in the most deserted part of the boulevard del' hopital in paris
this man had the air of a person who is seeking lodgings and he seemed to halt by preference at the most modest mouse som that dilapidated border of the faubourg saint marceau
we shall see further on that this man had in fact hired a chamber in that isolated quarter
this man in his attire as in all his person realized the type of what may be called the well bred mendicant extreme wretchedness combined with extreme cleanliness
this is a very rare mixture which inspires intelligent hearts with that double respect which one feels for the man who is very poor and for the man who is very worthy
he wore a very old and very well brushed roundhay a coarse coat worn perfectly threadbare of an ochre yellow a color that was not in the least eccentric at that epoch a large waistcoat with pockets of a venerable cut black breeches worn gray at the knee stockings of black worsted and thick shoes with copper buckles
he would have been pronounced a preceptor in some good family returned from the emigration
he would have been taken for more than sixty years of age from his perfectly white hair his wrinkled brown is livid lips and his countenance where everything breathed depression and weariness of life
judging from his firm tread from the singular vigor which stamped all his movements he would have hardly been thought fifty
the wrinkles on his brow were well placed and would have disposed in his favor anyone who observed him attentively
his lil contracted with a strange file which seemed severe and which was humble
there was in the depth of his glance an indescribable melancholy serenity
in his left hand he carried a little bundle tied up in a handkerchief in his right he leaned on a sort of a cudgel cut from some hedge
this stick had been carefully trimmed and had an air that was not too threatening the most had been made of its knobs and it had received a coral like read made from red wax it was a cudgel and it seemed to head and
there are but few passersby on that boulevard particularly in the winter
the man seemed to avoid them rather than to seek them but this without any affectation
at that epoch king louis xviii
sent nearly every day to choisy le roi it was one of his favorite excursions
towards twoo'clock almost invariably the royal carriage and cavalcade was seen to pass at full speed along the boulevard del' hopital
this served in lieu of a watch or click to the poor women of the quarter who said it is twoo'clock there he is returning to the tuileries
and some rushed forward and others drew up in line for a passing king always creates a tumult besides the appearance and disappearance of louis xviii
produced a certain effect in the streets of paris
it was rapid but majestic
this impotent king had a taste for a cast gallop as he was not able to walk he wished to run that cripple would gladly have had himself drawn by the lightning
he passed pacific and severe in the midst of naked swords
his massive coach all covered with gilding with great branches of lilies painted on the panels thundered noisily along
there was hardly time to cast a glance upon it
in the rear angle on the right there was visible on tufted cushions of white satin a large firm and ruddy face a brow freshly powdered al' oiseau royal a proud hard crafty eye the whole of an educated man two great epaulets with bullion fringe floating over a bourgeois coat the golden fleece the cross of saint ooh la the cross of the legion of honor the silver plaque of the saint esprit a huge belly and a wide blue ribbon it was the king
outside of paris be held his hat decked with white ostrich plumes on his knees en wrapped in high english gaiters when he reentered the city he put on his hat and saluted rarely he stared solely at the people and they returned it in mind
when he appeared for the first time in the saint marceau quarter the whole success which he produced is contained in this remark of an inhabitant of the faubourg to his comrade that big fellow yonder is the government
this infallible passage of the king at the same hour was therefore the daily event of the boulevard del' hopital
the promenade run the yellow coat evidently did not belong in the quarter and probably did not belong in paris for he was ignorant as to this detail
when at twoo'clock the royal carriage surrounded by a squadron of the bodyguard all covered with silver la fete boucheron the boulevard after having made the turn of the salle tried she appeared surprised and almost alarmed
there was no one but himself in this cross lane
he drew up hastily behind the corner of the wall of an enclosure though this did not prevent m
le duc de havre from spying him out
m
le duc de havre as captain of the guard on duty that day was seated in the carriage opposite the king
he said to his majesty yonder is an evil looking man
members of the police who were clearing the king's route took equal note of him one of them received an order to follow him
but the man plunged into the deserted little streets of the faubourg and as twilight was beginning to call the agent list trace of him as is stated in a report addresses that same evening tom
le comted' angles minister of state prefect of police
when the man in the yellow coat had thrown the agent of this track here doubled his pace not without turning round many a time to assure himself that he was not being followed
at a quarter past four that is to say when night was fully come he passed in front of the theatre of the porte saint martin where the two convicts was being played that day
this poster illuminated by the theatre lanterns struck him for although he was walking rapidly he halted to read it
an instant later he was in the blind alley of lapland bette and he entered the plate's gain the pewter platter where the office of the coach for lanny was then situated
this coach set out at half past four
the horses were harnessed and the travellers summoned by the coachman were hastily climbing the lofty iron ladder of the vehicle
the man inquired have you a place
only one beside me in the box said the coachman
i will take it
climb up
nevertheless before setting out the coachman cast a glance at the traveller's shabby dress at the diminutive size of his bundle and made him pay his fare
are you going as far as lanny
demanded the coachman
yes said the man
the traveller paid to lanny
they started
when they had passed the barrier the coachman tried to enter into conversation but the traveller only replied in mono syllables
the coachman took to whistling and swearing at his horses
the coachman wrapped himself up in his cloak
it was cold
the man did not appear to be thinking of that
thus they passed tournai and neuilly sur marne
towards sixo'clock in the evening they reached chelles
the coachman drew up in front of the carter's' inn installed in the ancient buildings of the royal abbey to give his horse's a breathing spell
i get down here said the man
he took his bundle and his cudgel and jumped down from the vehicle
an instant later he had disappeared
he did not enter the inn
when the coach set out for lanny a few minutes later it did not encounter him in the principal street of chelles
the coachman turned to the inside travellers
there said he is a man who does not belong here for i do not know him
he had not the air of owning a son but he does not consider money he pays to pay by and he goes only as far as chelles
it is night all the housewares but he does not enter the inn and he is not to be found
so he has river through the earth
the man had not plunged into the earth but he had gone with great strides through the dark down the principal street of chelles then he had turned to the right before reaching the church into the cross road leading to montrer mail like a person who was acquainted with the country and had been there before
he followed this road rapidly
at the spot where it is intersected by the ancient tree bordered road which runs from nanny to lanny he heard people coming
he concealed himself precipitate p gina ditch and there waited until the passersby were at a distance
the precaution was nearly superfluous however for as we have already said it was a very dark december night
not more than two or three stars were visible in the sky
it is at this point that the ascent of the bill begins
the man did not return to the road to monte dr neil he struck across the fields to the right and entered the forest with long strides
once in the forest he slackened his pace and began a careful examination of all the trees advancing step by step as though seeking and following a mysterious road known to himself alone
there came a moment when he appeared to lose himself and he paused in indecision
atlas the arrived by dint of feeling his way inch by inch at a clearing where there was a great heap of whitish stones
he stepped up briskly to these stones and examined them attentively through the mists of night as though he were passing them in review
a large tree covered with those excess fences which are the warts of vegetation stood a few paces distant from the pile of stones
he went up to this tree and passed his hand over the bark of the trunk as though seeking to recognize and count all the warts
opposite this tree which was a nadh there was a chestnut tree suffering from a peeking of the bark to which a hand of zinc had been nailed by way of dressing
he raised himself on tiptoe and touched this band of zinc
then get rid about for a while on the ground comprised in the space between the tree and the heap of stones like a person who is trying to assure himself that the soil has not recently been disturbed
that done he took his bearings and resumed his march through the forest
it was the man who had just met cosette
as he walked through the thicket in the direction of mont vermeil he has espied that tiny shadow moving with a groan depositing a burden on the ground then taking it up and setting out again
he drew near and perceived that it was a very young child laden with an enormous bucket of water
then he approached the child and silently grasped the handle of the bucket
chapter vii does the side by side with the stranger in the dark cosette as we have said was not frightened
the man accosted her
he spoke in a voice that was grave and almost base
my child what you are carrying is very heavy for you
cosette raised her head and replied yes sir
give it to me said the man i will carry it for you
cosette let go of the bucket handle
the man walked along beside her
it really is very heavy he muttered between his teeth
then he added how old are you little one
eight air
and have you come from far like this
from the spring in the forest
are you going far
a good quarter of an hour's walk from here
the man said nothing for a moment then he remarked abruptly so you have no mother
idon't know answered the child
before the man had time to speak again she added idon't think so
other people have mothers
i have none
and after a silence she went on i think that i never had any
the man halted he set the bucket in the ground bent down and placed both hands on the child's shoulders making an effort to look at her and to see her face in the dark
cosette's thin and sickly face was vaguely outlined by the livid light in the sky
what is your name
said the mag
cosette
the man seemed to have received an electric shock
he looked at her once more then he removed his hands from cosette's shoulders seized the bucket and set out again
after a moment he inquired where do you live little one
at mont vermeil if you know where that is
that is where we are going
yes sir
he paused then began again who sent you at such an hour to get water in the forest
it was madame the nerdier
the man resumed in a voice which he strove to render in different but in which there was nevertheless a singular tremor what does your madame the barrier do
she is my mistress said the child
she keeps the inn
the inn
said the man
well i am going to lodge there tonight
show me the way
we are on the way there said the child
the man walked tolerably fast
cosette followed him without difficulty
she no longer felt any fatigue
from time to time she raised her eyes towards the man with a sort of tranquillity and an indescribable confidence
she had never been taught to turn to providence and to pray nevertheless she felt within her something which resembled hope and joy and which mounted towards heaven
several minutes elapsed
the man resumed is there no servant in madame the barrier's house
no dir
are you alone there
yes sir
another pause ensued
cosette lifted up her voice that is to say there are two little girls
what little girls
po nine and selma
this was the way the child simplified the romantic hands so dear to the female the barrier
who are po nine and selma
they are madame the barrier's young ladies her daughters as you would say
and what do those girls do
oh
said the child they have beautiful dolls things with gold in the hall full of affairs
they play they amuse themselves
all day long
yes sir
and you
i
iwork
all day long
the child raised her great eyes in which hung a year which was not visible because of the darkness and replied gently yes sir
after an interval of silence she went on sometimes when i have finished my work and they let me i amuse myself too
how do you amuse yourself
in the best way i can
they let me alone but i have not many playthings
po nine and selma will not let me play with their dolls
i have only a little lead sword no longer than that
the child held up her tiny finger
and it will not cut
yes sir said the child it cuts salad and the heads of flies
they reached the village
cosette guided the stranger through the streets
they passed the bake shop but cosette did not think of the bread which she had been ordered to fetch
the man had ceased to ply her with questions and now preserved a gloomy silence
when they had left the church behind them the man on perceiving all the open air booths asked cosette so there is a fair going on here
no sir it is christmas
as they approached the tavern cosette timidly touched his arm monsieur
what my child
we are quite near the house
well
will you let me take my bucket now
why
if madame sees that someone has carried it for me she will beat me
the man handed her the bucket
an instant later they were at the tavern door
chapter viii the unpleasantness of receiving into one's houses poor man who may be a rich man cosette could not refrain from casting a sidelong glance at the big doll which was still displayed at the toy merchant's then she knocked
the door opened
the the barrier appeared with a candle in her hand
zh
so it's you you little wretch
gold mercy but you've taken your time
the hussy has been amusing herself
madame said cosette trembling all over here's a gentleman who wants a lodging
the the barrier speedily replaced her grief air by her amiable grimace a change of aspect common to tavern keepers and eagerly sought the newcomer with her eyes
this is the gentleman
said she
yes madame fell off the man raising his hand to his hat
wealthy travellers are not so polite
this gesture and an inspection of the stranger's costume and baggage which the the barrier passed in review with one glance caused the amiable grimace to vanish and the gruff mien to reappear
she resumed dryly enter my goodman
the good man entered
the the barrier cast a second glance at him paid particular attention to his frock coat which was absolutely threadbare and to host at which was a little gathered and tossing her head wrinkling her nose and screwing up her eyes she consulted her husband who was still drinking with the carters
the husband replied by that imperceptible movement of the forefinger which backed up by an inflation of the lips signifies in such cases a regular beggar
thereupon the the nerdier exclaimed am
see here my good man i am very sorry but i have no room left
put me where you like said the man in the attic in the stable
i will pay as though i occupied a room
ford geo us
forty sous agreed
very well then
for the ous
said a carter in a low tone to the the married woman why the charge is only twenty do us
it is forth in his case retorted the the barrier in the same tone
idon't lodge poor folks for less
that's true added her husband gently it ruins a house to have such people in it
in the meantime the man lay in this bundle and his cudgel on a bench had seated himself at a table on which cosette made haste to place a bottle of wine and a glass
the merchant who had demanded the bucket of water took it to his horse himself
cosette resumed her place under the kitchen table and her knitting
the man who had barely moistened his lips in the wine which he had poured out for himself observed the child with peculiar attention
cosette was ugly
if she had been happy she might have been pretty
we have already given a sketch of that sombre little figure
rosette was thin and pale she was nearly eight years old but she seemed to be hardly six
her large eyes sunken in a sort of shadow were almost put out with weeping
the corners of her mouth had that curve of habitual anguish which is seen in condemned persons and desperately sick people
her hands were as her mother had divined ruined with chip blaine
the fire which illuminated her at that moment brought into relief all the angles of her bones and rendered her thinness frightfully apparent
as she was always shivering she had acquired the habit of pressing her knees one against the other
her entire clothing was but arab which would have inspired pity in summer and which inspired horror in winter
all she had one a whole ridden linen not a scrap of woollen
her skin was visible here and there and everywhere black and blue spots could be descried which marked the places where the the barrier woman had touched her
her naked legs were thin and red
the hollows in her neck were enough to make one weep
this child's whole person her mien her attitude the sound of her voice the intervals which she allowed to elapse between one word and the next her glance her silence her slightest gesture expressed and betrayed one sole idea fear
fear was diffused all over her she was covered with it so to speak fear drew her elbows close to her hips withdrew her heels under her petticoat made her occupy as little space as possible allowed her only the breath that was absolutely necessary and had become what might be called the habit of her body admitting or no possible variation except an increase
in the depths of her eyes there was an astonished book where terror lurker
her fears as such that on her arrival set as she was cosette did not dare to approach the fire and sri herself but sat silently down to her work again
the expression in the glance of that child of eight years was habitually so gloomy and at times so tragic that it seemed at certain moments as though she were on the verge of becoming an idiot or a demon
as we have stated she had never known what it is to pray she had never set foot in a church
have i. the time
said the the gardler
the man in the yellow coat never took his eyes from cosette
all at once the the barrier exclaimed by the way where's that bread
cosette according to her custom whenever the the bar code ip lifted her voice emerged with great haste from beneath the table
she had completely forgotten the bread
she had recourse to the expedient of children who live in a constant state of fear
she lied
madame the baker's shop was shut
you should have knocked
i did knock madame
well
he did not open the door
i'll find out tomorrow whether that is true said the the barrier and if you are telling me a lie i'll lead you a pretty dance
in the meantime give me back my fifteen soup if cs
cosette plunged her hand into the pocket of her apron and turned green
the fifteen cou piece was not there
at come now said madame the hardier did you hear me
cosette turned her pocket inside out there was nothing in it
what could have become of that money
the unhappy little creature could not find a word to say
she was petrified
have you lost that fifteen spy piece
screamed the the barrier hoarsely or do you want to rob me of it
at the same time she stretched out her arm towards the cato' nine tails which hung on a nail in the chimney corner
this formidable gesture restored to cosette sufficient strength to shriek mercy madame madame
i will not do so any more
the the hardier took down the whip
in the meantime the man in the yellow cost had been fumbling in the fog of his waistcoat without anyone having noticed his movements
besides the other travellers sets drinking or playing cards and were not paying attention to anything
cosette contracted herself into a ball with anguish within the angle of the chimney endeavoring to gather up and conceal her poor half nude limbs
the the barrier raised her arm
pardon me madame said the man but just now i caught sight of something which had fallen from this little one's apron pocket and rolled aside
perhaps this is it
at the same time he bent down and seemed to be searching on the floor for a moment
exactly here it is he went on straightening himself up
and he held out a silver coin to the the barrier
yes that's it said she
it was not it for it was a twenty so i piece but the the barrier found it to her advantage
she put the coin in her pocket and confined herself to casting a fierce glance at the child accompanied with the remarkdon't let this ever happen again
cosette returned to what the the hardier called her kennel and her large eyes which were riveted on the traveller began to take on an expression such as they had never worn before
thus far it was only an innocent amazement but a sort of stupefied confidence was mingled with it
by the way would you like some supper
the the barrier inquired of the traveller
he made no reply
he appeared to be absorbed in thought
what sort of a man is that
she muttered between her teeth
he's some frightfully poor wretch
hehasn'ta sou to pay for a supper
will be even pay me for his lodging
it's very lucky all the same that it did not occur to him to steal the money that was on the floor
in the meantime a door had opened and soon one and a selma entered
they were two really pretty little girl's more bourgeois than peasant in looks and very charming the one with shining chestnut tree see the other with long black braids hanging down her back both vivacious next plump rosy and healthy and a delight to the eye
they were warmly clad but with so much maternal art that the thickness of the stuffs did not detract from the coquet rule arrangement
there was a hint of winter though the springtime was not wholly effaced
light emanated from these two little beings
besides this they were on the throne
in their toilette win their gayety in the noise which they made there was sovereignty
when they entered the the married said to them in a grumbling tone which was full of adoration am
there you are you children
then drawing them one after the other to her knees smoothing their hair tying their ribbons a fresh and then releasing them with that gentleman bed of anakin hoff which is peculiar to mothers she exclaimed what frights they are
they went and seated themselves in the chimney corner
they had a doll which they turned over and over on their knees with all sorts of joyous chatter
from time to time cosette raised her eyes from her knitting and watched their play with a melancholy air
epo nine and a selma did not look at cosette
she was the same sex dog to them
these three little girls did not yet reckon up four and twenty years between them but they already represented the whole society of man envy on the one side disdain on the other
the roll of the the barrier sisters was very much faded very old and much broken but it seemed none the less armor able to cosette who had never had a doll in her life a real doll to make use of the expression which all children will understand
all at once the the barrier who had been going back and forth in the room perceived that cosette's mind was distracted and that instead of working she was paying attention to the little ones at their play
ah
i've caught you at it
she cried
so that's the way you work
i'll make you work to the tune of the whip that i will
the stranger turned to the the barrier without quitting his chair
bah madame he said with an almost timid and let her play
such a wish expressed by a traveller who had eaten a slice of mutton and had drunk a couple of bottles of wine with his supper and who had not the air of being frightfully poor would have been equivalent to an order
but that a man with such what should permit himself such a desire and that a man with such a coat should permit himself to have swill was something which madame the barrier did not intend to tolerate
she retorted with acrimony she must work since she eats
idon't feed her to do nothing
what is she making
went on the stranger in a gentle voice which contrasted strangely with his beggarly garments and his porter's shoulders
the the hardier deigned to reply stockings if you please
stockings for my little girls who have gone so to speak and who are absolutely barefoot just now
the man looked at cosette's poor little red feet and continued when will she have finished this pair of stockings
she has at least three or four good days' work on the'm still the lazy creature
and how much will that pair of stockings be worth when she has finished them
the the barrier cast a glance of disdain on him
thirty sous at least
will you sell them for five france
went on the man
good heavens
exclaimed a carter who was listening with a loud laugh five france
the deuce i should think so
five balls
the barrier thought it time to strike in
yes sir of such is your fancy you will be allowed to have that pair of stockings for five france
we can refuse nothing to travellers
you must pay on the spot said then he had died in her curt and peremptory fashion
i will buy that pair of stockings replies the man and he added drawing a five franc piece from his pocket and laying it on the table i will pay for them
then he turned to cosette
now i own your work play my child
the carter was so much touched by the five grand piece that he abandoned his glass and hastened up
but it's true
he cried examining it
a real mind wheel
and not counterfeit
the barrier approached and silently put the coin in his pocket
the then a drier had no reply to make
she bit her lips and her face assumed an expression of hatred
in the meantime cosette was trembling
she ventured to ask is it true madame
may i play
play
said the the barrier in a terrible voice
thanks madame said cosette
and while her mouth thanked the then archer her whole little soul thanked the traveller
the barrier had resumed his drinking his wife why spared in his ear who can this yellowman be
i have seen millionaires with coats like that replied the barrier in a sovereign manner
cosette had dropped her knitting but had not left her seat
cosette always moved as little as possible
she picked up some old rats and her little leads word from a box behind her
epo nine and a selma paid no attention to what was going on
they had just executed a very important operation they had just got told of the cat
they had thrown their roll on the ground and soon one who was the elder was swatting the little cat in spite of items wing and its contortions in a quantity of clothes and red and blues craps
while performing this serious and difficult work she was saying to her sister in that sweet and adorable language of children whose grace like the splendor of the butterfly's wing vanishes when one essays to fix it fast
you see sister this doll is more amusing than the other
she twists she cried she is warm
see sister let us play with her
she shall be my little girl
i will be a lady
i will come to see you and you sha po look at her
gradually you will perceive her whiskers and that will surprise you
and then you will see her ears and then you will see her tail and it will amaze you
and you will say to me' ah
mon dieu
' and i will say to you' yes madame it is my little girl
little girls are made like that just at present
's selma listened admiringly for logins
in the meantime the drinkers had begun to sing an obscene song and to laugh at it until the ceilings book
the mardi gras companies and encouraged them
as birds make nests out of everything so children make a roll out of anything which comes to hand
while epo nine and a selma were bundling up the vat cosette on her side had dressed up her sword
that done she laid it in her arms and sang to it softly to pull it to sleep
the doll is one of the most imperious needs and at the same time one of the most chat king instincts of feminine childhood
to care for to clothe to deck to dress to undress to redress to teach scold a little to rock to candle to pull to sleep to imagine that something is someone therein lies the whole woman's future
while dreaming and chattering making tiny outfits and baby clothes while seeing little towns and corsages and novices the child grows into a young girl the young girl into a big girl the big girl into a woman
the first child is the continuation of the last doll
a little girl without a doll is almost as unhappy and quite as impossible as a woman without children
so cosette has made herself a roll out of the sword
madame the barrier approached the yellowman my husband is right she thought perhaps it is m
laffitte there are such queer rich men
she came and set her elbows on the table
monsieur said she
at this word monsieur the man turned up to that time the the barrier had addressed him only as brave homme or bon homme
you sees or she pursued assuming a sweetie hair that was even more repulsive to behold than her fierce mien i am willing that the child should play i do not oppose it but it is good for once because you are generous
you see she has nothing she must needs work
then this child is not yours
demanded the man
oh
mon dieu
no sir
she is a little beggar whom we have taken in through charity a sort of imbecile child
she must have water on the brain she has a large head as you see
we do what we can for her for we are not rich we have written in vain to her native place and have received no reply these six months
it must be that her mother is dead
ah
said the man and fell into his r every once more
her mother didn't amount to much added that he had does she abandoned her child
during the whole of this conversation cosette as though warned by some instinct that she was under discussion has not taken her eyes from the the barrier's face she listened vaguely she caught a few words here and there
meanwhile the drinkers all three quarters intoxicated were repeating their unclean refrain with redoubled gayety it was a highly spices and wanton song in which the virgin and the infant jesus were introduced
the the barrier went off to take part in the shouts of laughter
cosette from her post under the table gazed at the fire which was reflected from her side edges
she had begun to rock the sort of baby which she had made and as she rocked it she sang in a low voice my mother is dead
my mother is dead
my mother is dead
on being urged affect by the hostess the yellowman the millionaire consented at last to take supper
what does monsieur wish
bread and cheese said the man
decidedly he is a beggar thought madame the barrier
the drunken men were still singing their song and the child under the table was singing here
all at once cosette paused she had just turned round and caught sight of the little the barriers' roll which they had abandoned for the cat and had left on the floor a few paces from the kitchen table
then she dropped the swaddled sword which only half met her needs and cast her eyes slowly round the room
madame the barrier was whispering to her husband and counting over some money po nine and selma were playing with the cat the travellers were eating or drinking or singing not a glance was fixed on her
she had not a moment to lose she crept out from under the table on her hands and knees made sure once more that no one was watching her then she slipped quickly up to the doll and seized it
an instant later she was in her place again seated motionless and only turned spas to cast a shadow on the doll which she held in her arms
the happiness of playing with a doll was so rare for her that it contained all the violence of voluptuousness
no one had seen her except the traveller who was slowly devouring his meagre supper
this joy lasted about a quarter of an hour
but with all the precautions that cosette had taken she did not perceive that one of the doll's legs stuck out and that the fire on the hearth lighted it up very vividly
that punk and shining foot projecting from the shadow suddenly struck the eye of a selma who said to do on onelook
sister
the two little girls paused in style faction cosette had dared to take their doll
e login e. rose and without releasing the cat she ran to her mother and began to tug at her skirt
let me alone
said her mother what do you want
mother said the child look there
and she pointed to cosette
cosette absorbed in the ecstasies of possession no longer saw or heard anything
madame the barrier's countenance assumed that peculiar expression which is composed of the terrible mingled with the trifles of life and which has caused this style of woman to be named me gas tax
in this occasion wounded pride exasperated her wrath still further
cosette had overstepped all bounds cosette had laid violent hands on the doll belonging to these young ladies
a czarina who should see a must im trying on her imperial son's blue ribbon would wear no other race
she shrieked in a voice rendered hoarse with indignation cosette
cosette started as though the earth has trembles beneath her she turned round
cosette
repeated the the barrier
cosette took the doll and laid it gently on the floor with a sort of veneration mingled with despair then without taking her eyes from it she clasped her hands and what is terrible to relate of a child of that are a hearing them then not one of the emotions of the day neither the trip to the forest nor the weight of the bucket of water nor the loss of the money nor the sight of the whip not even the sad words which she had heard madame the barrier utter had been able to wring this from her she wept she burst out sobbing
meanwhile the traveller had risen to his feet
what is the matter
he said to the the barrier
don't you see
said the the barrier pointing to the corpus delicto which lay at cosette's text
well what if it
resumed the man
that beggar replied the the barrier has permitted herself to touch the children's doll
all this noise for that
said the man well what if she did play with that doll
she touched it with her dirty hands
pursued the the barrier with her frightful bands
here cosette redoubled her sobs
will you stop your noise
screamed the then at diet
the man went straight to the street door opened it and stepped out
as soon as he had gone the the barrier profited by his absence to give cosette a hearty kick under the table which made the child utter loud cries
the door opened again the man reappeared he carried in both hands the fabulous full which we have mentioned and which all the village brats had been staring at ever since the morning and he set it up right infront of cosette saying here this is for you
it must be supposed that in the course of the hour and more eric g. he had spent there he had taken confused notice through his revert of that you shop lighted up by fire pits and candles so splendidly that it was visible like an illumination through the window of the drinking shop
cosette raised her eyes she gazed at the man approaching her with that doll as she might have gazed at the sun she heard the unprecedented words it is for you she stared at him she stared at the doll then she slowly retreated and his herself at the extreme end under the table in a corner of the wall
she no longer cried she no longer wept she had the appearance of no longer daring to breathe
the then we did repo nine and a selma were like statues also the very drinkers had paused a solemn silence reigned through the whole room
madame the barrier petrified and mute recommended her conjectures who is that old fellow
i shea poorman
i shea millionaire
perhaps he is both that is to say a thief
the face of the male the hardier presented that expressive fold which accentuates the human countenance whenever the dominant instinct appears there in all its bestial force
the tavern keeper stated alternately at the doll and at the traveller he seemed to be scenting out the man as he would have scented out what of money
this did not last longer than the space of a flash of lightning
he stepped up to his wife and said to her in a low voice that machine costs at least thirty france
no nonsense
down on your belly before that man
gross natures have this in common with naive nature's that they possess no transition state
well cosette said the the barrier in a voice that strive to be sweet and which was composed of the bitter honey of malicious women aren't you going to take your doll
cosette ventured to emerge from her hold
the gentleman has given you a doll my little cosette said the barrier with a caressing air
take it it is yours
cosette gazed at the marvellous doll in a sort of terror
her face was still flooded with tears but her eyes began to fill like the sky at daybreak with strange beams of joy
what she felt at that moment was a little like what she would have felt if she had been abruptly told little one you are the queen of france
it seemed to her that if she touched that will lightning would vary from it
this was true up to a certain point for she said to herself that the the barrier would's cold and heather
nevertheless the attraction carried the day
she ended by drawing near and murmuring timidly as she turned towards madame the barrier may i madame
no words can render that air at once despairing terrified and ecstatic
parsi
cried the the barrier it is yours
the gentleman has given it to you
truly air
said cosette
is it true
is the' lady' mine
the stranger's eyes seemed to be full of tears
he appeared to have reached that point of emotion where a man does not speak for fear lest he should deep
he nodded to cosette and placed the lady's hand in her tiny hand
cosette hastily withdrew her hand as though that of the lady scorched her and began to stare at the floor
we are forced to add that at that moment she stuck out her tongue in moderately
all at once she wheeled round and seized the doll in a transport
i shall call her catherine she said
it was an odd moment when cosette's tags met and clasped the ribbons and fresh pink muslims of the doll
madame she resumed may i put her on a chair
yes my child replied the the barrier
it was now the turn off po nine and a selma to gaze at cosette with envy
cosette placed catherine on a chair then seated herself on the floor in front of her and remained motionless without uttering a word in an attitude of contemplation
play cosette said the stranger
oh
i am playing returned the child
this stranger this unknown individual who had the air of a visit which providence was making on cosette was the person whom the the barrier hated worse than anyone in the world at that moment
however it was necessary to control herself
habituated as she was to dissimulation through endeavoring to copy her husband in all his actions these emotions were more than she could endure
she made haste to send her daughters to bed then she asked the man's permission to send cosette off also for she has worked hard all day she added with a maternal air
cosette went off to bed carrying catherine in her arms
from time to time the the barrier went to the other end of the room where her husband was to relieve her soul as she said
she exchanged with her husband words which were all the more curious because she dared not utter them aloud
old beast
what has he got in his belly to come and upset us in this manner
to want that little monster to play
to give away forty franc dolls to a made that i would sell for forth sous so i would
a little more and he will be saying your majesty to her as though to the duchess de berry
is there any sense in it
is he had then that mysterious old fellow
why
it is perfectly simple replied the barrier if that amused him
it amuses you to have the little one work it amused him to have her play
he's allright
a traveller can do what he pleases when he pays for it
if the old fellow is a philanthropist what is that to you
if he is an imbecile it does not concern you
what are you worrying for so long as he has money
the language of a master and the reasoning of an innkeeper neither of which admitted of any reply
the man had placed his elbows on the table and resumed his thoughtful attitude
all the other travellers both peelers and careers had withdrawn a little and had ceased singing
they were staring at him from a distance with a sort of respectful awe
this poorly dressed man who drew find wheels from his pocket with so much ease and who lavished gigantic dolls on dirty little beats in wooden shoes was certainly a magnificent fellow and one to be feared
many hours passed
the midnight mass was over the chimes had ceased the drinkers had taken their departure the drinking shop was closed the public room was deserted the fire extinct the stranger still remained in the same place and the same attitude
from time to time he changed the elbow on which he leaned
that was all but he had not said a word since cosette had left the room
the the barriers alone out of politeness and curiosity has remained in the room
is he going to pass the night in that fashion
grumbled the the barrier
when twoo'clock in the morning struck she declared herself vanquished and said to her husband i'm going to bed
do as you like
her husband seated himself at a table in the corner lighted a candle and began to read the courrier francais
a good hour passed this
the worthy innkeeper had perused the courrier francais at least three times from the date of the number to the printer's name
the stranger did not stir
the barrier fidgeted dough feel it blew his nose and creamed his chair
not a movement on the man's part
is he asked p
thought the barrier
the man was not asleep but nothing could arouse hum
at last the barrier took off his cap stepped gently up to him and ventured to say is not monsieur going to his repose
not going to bed would have seemed to him excessive and familiar
to repose smacked of luxury and respect
these words possess the mysterious and admirable property of swelling the bill on the following day
a chamber where one sleeps costs twenty sousa chamber in which one reposes costs twenty france
well
said the stranger you are right
where is your stable
sir
exclaimed the barrier with a smile i will conduct yousif
he took the candle the man picked up his bundle and cudgel and the barrier conducted him to a chamber on the first floor which was of rare splendor all furnished in mahogany with a low bedstead curtained with red calico
what is this
said the traveller
it is really our bridal chamber said the tavern keeper
my wife and i occupy another
this is only entered three or four times a year
i should have liked the stable quite as well said the man abruptly
the married pretended not to hear this in amiable remark
he lighted two perfectly fresh wax candles which figures on the chimney piece
a very good fire was clicked inn on the hearth
on the chimney piece under a glass globe stood a woman's head dress in silver wire and orange flowers
and what is this
resumed the stranger
thats it said the barrier is my wife's wedding bonnet
the traveller surveyed the object with a glance which seemed to say there really was a time then when that monster was a maiden
the barrier lied however
when he had leased this paltry building for the purpose of converting it into a tavern he had found this chamber decorated in just this manner and had purchased the furniture and obtained the orange flowers at second hand with the idea that this would cast a graceful shadow on his spouse and would result in what the english call respectability for his house
when the traveller turned round the host had disappeared
the hardier has withdrawn discreetly without venturing to wish him a good night as he did not wish to treat with disrespectful cordiality a man whom he proposed to fleece royally the following morning
the innkeeper retired to his room
his wife was in bed but she was not asleep
when she heard her husband's steps he turned over and said to him do you know i'm going to turn cosette out of doors tomorrow
the barrier replied solely how you do go on
they exchanged no further words and a few moments later their candle was extinguished
as for the traveller he had deposited his cudgel and his bundle in a corner
the landlord once done he threw himself into an armchair and remained for some time buried in thought
then he removed his shoes took one of the two candles blew out the other opened the door and quitted the room gw song about him like a person who is in search of something
he traversed a corridor and came upon a staircase
there he heard a very faint and gentle sound like the breathing of a child
he followed this sound and came to a sort of triangular recess built under the staircase or rather formed by the staircase itself
this recess was nothing else than the space under the steps
there in the midst of all sorts of old papers and lots herds among dust and spiders' debs was a bed if one can call by the name of beds straw pallet so full of holes as to display the straw and a coverlet so tattered a show how the pallet
no sheets
this was placed on the floor
in this bed cosette was sleeping
the man approached and gazed down upon her
cosette was in a profound sleep she was fully dressed
in the winter she did not undress in order that she might not be so sold
against her breast was pressed the doll whose large eyes wide open glittered in the dark
from time to time she gave vent to a deep sigh as though she were on the point of waking and she strained the doll almost convulsively in her arms
beside her bed there was only one of her wooden shoes
a door which stood open near cosette's pallet permitted a view of a rather large darkroom
the stranger stepped into it
at the further extremity through a glass door he saw two small very white beds
they belonged to epo nine and a selma
behind these beds and half hidden stop canon curtained wicker cradle in which the little boy who had cried all the evening lay asleep
the stranger conjectured that this chamber connected with that of the the barrier pair
he was on the point of retreating when his eye fell upon the fireplace one of those vast tavern chimneys where there is always so little fire when there is any fire at all and which are so good to look at
there was no fire in this one there was not even ashes but there was something which attracted the stranger's gaze nevertheless
it was two tiny children's shoes coquettish in shape and unequal in size
the traveller recalled the graceful and immemorial custom in accordance with which children place their shoes in the chimney on christmas eve there to await in the darkness some sparkling gift from their good fairy
epo nine and a selma had taken care not to omit this and each of them had set one of her shoes on the hearty
the traveller bent over them
the fairy that is to say their mother had already paid her visit and in each he saw a brand new and shining ten so i piece
the man straightened himself up and was on the point of withdrawing when farin in the darkest corner of the hearth he caught sight of another object
he looked at it and recognized a wooden shoes frightful shot of the coarsest description half dilapidated and all covered with ashes and dried mhd
it was cosette's sabot
cosette with that touching trust of childhood which can always be received yet never discouraged had placed her shoe on the hearthstone also
hope in a child who has never known anything but despair is a sweet and touching thing
there was nothing in this wooden shoe
the stranger fumbled in his waistcoat bent over and placed x louisd' or in cosette's shoe
then he regained his own chamber with the stealthy tread of a wolf
chapter ix the hardier and his manoeuvres in the following morning two hours at least before daybreak the hardier seated beside a candle in the public room of the tavern owning and was making out the bill for the traveller with the yellow coat
his wife standing beside him and half bent over him was following him with her eyes
they exchanged for a word
on the one hand there was profound meditation on the other the religious admiration with which one watched the birth and development of a marvel of the human mind
a noise was audible in the house it was the park sweeping the stairs
after the lapse of a good quarter of an hour and some erasures the barrier produced the following masterpiece bill of the gentleman in no
supper
france
chamber
candle
fire
service
total
france
service was written servis se
twenty three france
cried the woman with an enthusiasm which was mingled with some hesitation
like all great artists the barrier was dissatisfied
pruh
he exclaimed
it was the ascent of castlereagh auditing france's bill at the congress of vienna
monsieur the barrier you are right he certainly owes that murmured the wife who was thinking of the doll bestowed on cosette in the presence of her daughters
it is just got it is too much
he will not pay it
the barrier laughed solely as usual and said he will pay
this laugh was the supreme assertion of certainty and author lth
that which was asserted in this manner must needs be so
his wife did not insist
she set about arranging the table her husband paced the room
a moment later he added iowa full fifteen hundred francs
he went and seated himself in the chimney corner meditating with his feet among the warm ashes
ah
by the way resumed his wife youdon''t forget that i'm going to turn cosette out of doors today
the monster
she breaks my heart with that doll others
i'd rather marry louis xviii
than keep her another day in the house
the harrier lighted his pipe and replied between two puffs you will hand that bill to the man
then he went out
hardly had he left the room when the traveller entered
the bar died instantly reappeared behind him and remained motionless in the half open door visible only to his wife
the yellowman carried his bundle and his cudgel in his hand
up so early
said madame the barrier is monsieur leaving us already
as she spoke thus she was twisting the bill about in her hands with an embarrassed air and making creases in it with her nails
gerhard face presented a shade which was not habitual with it timidity and scruples
to present such a bill to a man who had so completely the air of a poor wretch seemed difficult to her
the traveller appeared to be preoccupied and absent minded
he replied yes madame i am going
so monsieur has no business in mont vermeil
hi i was passing through
that is all
what do i owe you madame he added
the the married silently handed him the folded bill
the man unfolded the paper and glanced at it but his thoughts were evidently elsewhere
madame he resumed us business good herein montrer me up
also monsieur replied the the barrier stupefied at not witnessing another sort of explosion
she continued in a dreary and lamentable to neon
monsieur times are so hard
and then we have so few bourgeois in the neighborhood
all the people are poor you see
if we had not now and then some rich and generous travellers like monsieur we should not get along at all
we have so many expenses
just see that child is costing us our very eyes
what child
why the little one you know
cosette the park as she is called hereabouts
ah
said the man
she went on how stupid these peasants are with their nicknames
she has more the air of an afghan of a lark
you see sir we do not ask charity and we can not bestow it
we earn nothing and we have to lay out a great deal
the license the imposts the food and window tax the hundredths
monsieur is aware that the government demands a terrible deal of money
and then i have my daughters
i have no need to bring up other people's children
the man resumed in that voice which he strove to render in different and in which there lingered a tremor what if one were to rid you or her
who
cosette
yes
the landlady's red and violent face brighten a cup hideously
ah
sir my dear sir take her keep her lead her off carry her away sugar her stuff her with truffles drink her father and the blessings of the good holy virgin and of all the saints of paradise be upon you
agreed
really
you will take her away
i will take her away
immediately
immediately
call the child
cosette
screamed the the barrier
in the meantime pursued the man i will pay you what i owe you
how much is it
he cast a glance on the bill and could not restrain a start of surprise twenty three france
he looked at the landlady and repeated twenty three francs
there was in the enunciation of these words thus repeated an accent between an exclamation and an interrogation point
the the barrier had had time to prepare herself for the stock
she replied with assurance good gracious yes sir it is twenty three france
the stranger laid five five franc pieces on the table
go and get the child said he
at that moment the barrier advanced to the middle of the room and said monsieur owes twenty six cpus
twenty six do us
exclaimed his wife
twenty cpus for the chamber resumed the hardier coldly and six sous for his supper
as for the child i must discuss that matters little with the gentleman
leave us wife
madame the barrier was dazzled as with the shock caused by unexpected lightning flashes of talent
she was conscious that a great actor was making his entrance on the stage uttered not a word in reply and left the room
as soon as they were alone the barrier offered the traveller a chair
the traveller seated himself the hardier remained standing and his face assumed a singular expression of good fellowship and simplicity
sir said he what i have to say to you is this that i adore that child
the stranger based intently at him
what child
the barrier continued how strange it is one grows attached
what money is that
take back hour hundred soul oecd
i adore the child
whom do you mean
demanded the stranger
eh
our little cosette
are you not intending to take her away from us
well i speak frankly as true as you are an honest man i will not consent to it
i shall miss that child
i saw her first when she was a tiny thing
it is true that she costs us money it is true that she has her faults it is true that we are not rich it is true that i have paid out over four hundred francs for drugs for just one other illnesses
but one must do something for the good god's sake
she has neither father nor mother
i have brought her up
i have bread enough for her and for myself
in truth i think a great deal of that child
you understand one conceived an affection for a person i am a good sort of a beast i am i do not reason i love that little girl my wife is quick tempered but she loves her also
you see she is just the same as our own child
i want to keep her to babble about the house
the stranger kept his eye intently fixed on the barrier
the latter continued excuse me sir but one does not give away one's child to a passerby like that
i am rights minor
still idon't way you are rich you have the air of a very good man if it were for her happiness
but one must find out that
you understand suppose that i were to let her go and to sacrifice myself i should like to know what becomes of her i should not wish to lose sight of her i should like to know with whom she is living so that i could go to see her from time to time so that she may know that her good foster father is alive that he is watching over her
in short there are things which are not possible
i do not even know your name
if you were to take her away i should say' well and the park what has become other
' one must at least see some petty scrap of paper some trifle in the way of a passport you know
the stranger still surveying him with that gaze which penetrates as the s aging goes to the very depths of the conscience replied in a grave firm voice monsieur the barrier one does not require a passport to travel five leagues from parks
if i take cosette a way i shall take her away and that is the end of the matter
you will not know my name you will not know my residence you will not know where she is and my intention is that she shall never set eyes on you again so long as she lives
i break the thread which finds her foot and she departs
does that suit you
yes or go
since geniuses like demons recognize the presence of a superior god by certain signs the barrier comprehended that he had to deal with a very strong person
it was like an intuition be comprehended it with his spear and sagacious promptly use
while drinking with the carter's smoking and singing coarse songs on the preceding evening he had devoted the whole of the time to observing the stranger watching him like a cat and studying him like a mathematician
he had watched him both on his own account for the pleasure of the thing and through instinct and had spied upon him as though he had been paid for so doing
not a movement not a feature on the part of the man in the yellow great coat had escaped him
even before the stranger had so clearly manifested his interest in cosette the bad diet had divined his purpose
he had caught the old man's deep glance are turning constantly to the child
who was this man
why this interest
why this hideous costume when he had so much money in his purse
questions which he put to himself without being able to solve them and which irritated him
he had pondered it all night long
he could not be cosette's father
waste her grandfather
then why not make himself known at once
when one has a right one asserts it
this man evidently had no right over cosette
what was it then
the barrier lost himself in conjectures
he caught glimpses of everything but he saw nothing
be that as it may or entering into conversation with the man sure that there was some secret in the case that the latter had some interest in remaining in the shadow he felt himself strong when he perceived from the stranger's clear and firm retort that this mysterious personage was mysterious in so simple away he became conscious that he was weak
he had expected nothing if the sort
his conjectures were put to thee out
he rallied his ideas
he weighed everything in the space of a second
the barrier was one of those men who take in a situation at a glance
he decided that the moment had arrived for proceeding straightforward and quickly at that
he did as great leaders do at the decisive moment which they know that they alone recognize be abruptly unmasked his batteries
sir said he i am in need of fifteen hundred francs
the stranger took from his side pockets hold pocket book of black leather opened it drew out three bank bills which he laid on the table
then he placed his large thumb on the notes and said to the innkeeper go and fetch cosette
while this was taking place what had cosette been doing
on waking up cosette has run together shoe
in its he had found the gold piece
it was not a napoleon it was one of those perfectly new twenty franc pieces of the restoration on whose effigy the little prussian queue had replaced the laurel wreath
cosette was dazzled
her destiny began to intoxicate her
she did not know what a good piece was she had never seen one she hid it quickly in her pocket as though she had stolen it
still she felt that it really washers she guessed whence her gift had come but the joy which she experienced was full of fear
she was happy above all she was stupefied
such magnificent and beautiful things did not appear real
the doll frightened her the gold piece frightened her
she trembled vaguely in the presence of this magnificence
the stranger alone did not frighten her
on the contrary be reassured her
ever since the preceding evening amid all her amazement even in her sleep she had been thinking in her little childish kind of that man who seemed to be so poor and so sad and who was so rich and so kind
everything had changed for her since she had met that good man in the forest
cosette less happy than the most insignificant swallow of heaven had never known what it was to take refuge under a mother's shadow and under a wing
for the last five years that is to say as far back as her memory ran the poor child had shivered and trembled
she had always been exposed completely naked to the sharp wind of adversity now it seemed to her she was clothed
formerly her soul had seemed cold now it was warm
cosette was no longer afraid of the then dreier
she was no longer alone there was someone there
she hastily set about her regular morning duties
that louis which she had about her in the very apron pocket whence the fifteen so i piece had fallen on the night before distracted her thoughts
she dared not touch it but she spent five minutes in gazing at it with her tongue hanging out if the truth must be told
as she swept the staircase she paused remained standing there motionless forgetful of her broom and of the entire universe occupied in gazing at that star which was blazing at the bottom of her pocket
it was during one of these periods of contemplation that the the barrier joined her
she had gone in search of code treat her husband's orders
what was quite unprecedented she neither struck her nor said an insulting word to her
cosette she said almost gently come immediately
an instant later cosette entered the public room
the stranger took up the bundle which he had brought and untied it
this bundle contained a little woollen town an apron at us to an bodice a kerchief a petticoat woollen stockings shows a complete outfit for a girl of seven years
all was black
my child said the man take these and go and dress yourself quickly
daylight was appearing when those of the inhabitants of mont vermeil who had begun to open their doors be held a poorly clad old man leading a little girl dressed in mourning and carrying a link doll in her arms pass along the road to paris
they were going in the direction of live y
it was our man and cosette
no one knew the man as cosette was no longer in rats many did not recognize her
cosette was going away
with whom
she did not know
whither
she knew not
all that she understood was that she was led vung the the barrier tavern behind her
no one had thought of bidding her farewell nor had she thought of taking leave of any one
she was leaving that hated and hating house
poor gentle creature whose heart had been repressed up to that hour
cosette walked along gravely with her large eyes wide open and gazing at the sky
she had put her louis in the pocket of her new apron
from time to time she bent down and glanced at it then she looked at the goodman
she felt something as though she were beside the good god
chapter she who seeks to better himself may render his situation worse madame the barrier has allowed her husband to have his own way as washer wont
she had expected great results
when the man and cosette had taken their departure the barrier allowed a full quarter of an hour to elapse then he took her aside and showed her the fifteen hundred francs
is that all
said she
it was the first time since they had set up housekeeping that she had dared to criticise one of the master's acts
the blow told
you are right in sooth said he iam a fool
give me my hat
he folded up the three bank bills thrust them into his pocket and ran out in all haste but he made a mistake and turned to the right first
some neighbors of whom he made inquiries put him on the track again the park and the man had been seen going in the direction of live y
he followed these hints walking with great strides and talking to himself the while that man is evidently a million dressed in yellow and i am an animal
first he gave twenty sous then five france then fifty france then fifteen hundred francs all with equal readiness
he would have given fifteen thousand francs
but i shall overtake him
and then that bundle of clothes prepared beforehand for the child all that was singular many mysteries lay concealed under it
one does not let mysteries out of one's hand when one has once grasped the m
the secrets of the wealthy are sponges of good one must know how to subject them to pressure
all these thoughts whirled through his brain
i am an animal said he
when one leaves mont vermeil and reaches the turn which the road takes that runs to live hit can be seen stretching out before one to a great distance across the plateau
on arriving there be calculated that he ought to be able to see the old man and the child
he looked as far as his vision reached and saw nothing
he made fresh inquiries but he had wasted time
some passersby informed him that the man and child of whom he was in search had gone towards the forest in the direction of fanny
he hastened in that direction
they were far in advance of him but a child walks slowly and he walked fast and then he was well acquainted with the country
ali at once he paused and dealt himself a blow on his forehead like a man who has forgotten some essential point and who is ready to retrace his steps
i ought to have taken my gun said he to himself
the marxist was one of those double natures which sometimes pass through our midst without our being aware of the fact and who disappear without our finding them out because destiny has only exhibited one side of them
it is the fate of many men to live thus half submerged
in a calm and even situation the barrier possessed all that is required to make we will not say to be what people have agreed to call an honest trader a good bourgeois
at the same time certain circumstances being given certain smirks arriving to bring his under nature to the surface he had all the requisites for a blackguard
he was a shopkeeper in whom there was some faint of the monster
satan must have occasionally crouched down in some corner of the novel in which the hard usr swept and have fallen screaming in the presence of this hideous masterpiece
after a momentary hesitation bag
he thought they will have time to make their escape
and he pursued his road walking rapidly straight ahead and with almost an air of certainty with the sagacity of a fox scenting a covey of partridge a
in truth when he had passed the ponds and had traversed in an oblique direction the large clearing which lies on the right of the avenue de bellevue and reached that the valley which nearly makes the circuit of the hill and covers the arch of the ancient aqueduct of the abbey of chelle she caught sight over the top of the brushwood of the hat on which he had already erected so many conjectures it was that man's hat
the brushwood was not high
the barrier recognized the fact that the man and cosette were sitting there
the child could not be seen on account of her small size but the head of her doll was visible
the barrier was not mistaken
the man was sitting there and letting cosette get somewhat tested
the innkeeper walked round the brushwood and presented himself abruptly to the eyes of those whom he was in search of
pardon excuse me sir he said quite breathless but here are your fifteen hundred francs
so saying he handed the stranger the three bank bills
the man raised his eyes
what is the meaning of this
the barrier replied respectfully it means sir that i shall take back cosette
cosette shuddered and pressed close to the old man
he replied gazing to the very bottom of the hardore's eyes the whole and enunciating every syllable distinctly you are going to take back cosette
yes sir i am
i will tell you i have considered the matter
infact i have not the right to give her to you
i am an honest man you see this child does not belong to me she belongs to her mother
it was her mother who confided her time i can only design her to her mother
you will say to me' but her mother is dead
' good in that case i can only give the child up to the person who shall bring me a writing signed by her mother to the effect that i am to hand the child over to the person therein mentioned that is clear
the man without making any reply fumbled in his pocket and the barrier be held the pocketbook of bank bills make its appearance once more
the tavern keeper shivered with joy
good
thought he let us hold firm he is going to bribe me
before opening the pocketbook the traveller cast a glance about him the spot was absolutely deserted there was not a soul either in the woods or in the valley
the man opened his pocket book once more and grew from it not the handful of bills which the barrier expected but a simple little paper which he unfolded and presented fully open to the innkeeper saying you are right read
the barrier took the paper and reach
such
march
monsieur the hardier you will deliver cosette to this person
you will be paid for all the little things
i have the honor to salute you with respect fan time
you know that signature
resumed the man
it certainly was cant one's signature the barrier recognized it
there was no reply to make he experienced two violent vexations the vexation of renouncing the bribery which he had hoped for and the vexation of being beaten them an added you may keep this paper as your receipt
the barrier retreated intolerably good order
this signature is fairly well imitated he growled between his teeth however let it go
then he essayed a desperate effort
it is well sir he said since you are the person but i must be paid for all those little things
a great deal is owing to me
the man rose to his feet fillip ing the dust from his threadbare sleeve monsieur the barrier in january past the mother reckoned that she owes you one hundred and twenty france
in february you sent her a bill of five hundred francs you received three hundred francs at the end of february and three hundred francs at the beginning of march
since then nine months have elapsed at fifteen francs a month the price agreed upon which makes one hundred and thirty five france
you had received one hundred francs too much that makes thirty five still owing you
i have just given you fifteen hundred francs
the barrier's sensations were those of the wolf at the moment when he feels himself nipped and seized by the steel jaw of the trap
who is this devil of a man
he thought
he did what the wolf does he shook himself
audacity had succeeded with him once
monsieur idon't know your name he said resolutely and this time casting aside all respectful ceremony i shall take back cosette if you do not give me a thousand crowns
the stranger said tranquilly comes odette
he took cosette by his left hand and with his right he picked up his cudgel which was lying on the ground
the barrier noted the enormous size of the cudgel and the solitude of the spot
the man plunged into the forest with the child leaving the innkeeper motionless and speechless
while they were walking away the barrier scrutinized his huge shoulders which were a little rounded and his great fists
then bringing his eyes back to his own person they fell upon his feeble arms and his thin hands
i really must have been exceedingly stupid not to have thought to bring my gun he said to himself since i was going hunting
however the innkeeper did not give up
i want to know where he is going said he and he set out to follow them at a distance
two things were left on his hands an irony in the shape of the paper signed fat time and a consolation the fifteen hundred francs
the man led cosette off in the direction of live hand bondy
he walked slowly with dropping head in an attitude of reflection and sadness
the winter had thinned out the forest so that the barrier did not lose them from sight although he kept at a good distance
the man turned round from time to time and looked to see if he was being followed
all at once he caught sight of the barrier
he plunged suddenly into the brushwood with cosette where they could not h hide themselves
the deuce
said the barrier and here doubled his pace
the thickness of the undergrowth forced him to draw nearer to them
when the man had reached the densest part of the thicket he wheeled found
it was in vain that the barriers ought to conceal himself in the branches he could not prevent the man seeing him
the man cast upon him an uneasy glance them elevated his head and continued his course
the innkeeper set out again in pursuit
thus they continued for two or three hundred paces
all at once the man turned round once more he saw the innkeeper
this time he gazed at him with so sombre an air that the hardier decided that it was useless to proceed further
the barrier retraced his steps
chapter xi number reappears and cosette wins it in the lottery jean valjean was not dead
when he fell into the sea or rather when he threw himself into it he was not ironed as we have seen
he swam underwater until he reached a vessel at anchor to which a boat was moored
he found means of hiding himself in this boat until night
at night he swam off again and reached the shore a little way from cape brun
there as he did not lack money be procured clothing
a small country house in the neighborhood of bala guide was at that time the dressing room of escaped convicts a lucrative specialty
then jean valjean like all the sorry fugitives who are seeking to evade the vigilance of the law and social fatality pursued an obscure and undulating itinerary
he found his first refuge at pradesh a near beau's set
then he directed his course towards grand villa rw near briancon in the hautes alpes
it was a fumbling and uneasy flights moor's track whose branching care untraceable
later in some trace of his passage on to win in the territory of five jeux was discovered in the pyrenees at addons at the spot called granted exoyme c near the market of cma dailies and in the environs of perigueux at bruno e's canton of la chapelle to magnet
he reached paris
we have just seen by harmony vermeil
his first carson arriving in paris had been to buy mourning clothes for a little girl or from seven to eight years of age them to procure a lodging
that done he had be taken himself to montres neil
it will be remembered that already during his preceding escape he had made a mysterious trip thither or somewhere in that neighborhood of which the law had gathered an inkling
however he was thought to be dead and this still further increased the obscurity which had gathered about him
at paris one of the journals which chronicles the fact fell into his hands
he felt reassured and almost at peace as though he had really been dead
on the evening of the day when jean valjean rescued cosette from the class of the then add usr she returned to paris
here entered it at nightfall with the child by way of the barrier monceau x
there he entered a cabriolet which took him to the esplanade of the observatoire
there he got out paid the coachman took cosette by the hand and together they directed their steps through the darkness through the deserted streets which adjoint us our fine and the glaciers towards the boulevard del' hopital
the day had been strange and filled with emotions for rosette
they had eaten some bread and cheese purchased in isolated taverns behind hedges they had changed carriages frequently they had travelled short distances on foot
she made no complaint but she was weary and jean valjean perceived it by the way she dragged more and more on his hand as she walked
he took her on his back
cosette without letting go of catherine laid her head on jean valjean's shoulder and there fell asleep
book fourth
the gorge au novel illustration the gorge au novel by or beau house chapter i master not be au forty years ago a gambler who had ventured into that unknown country of the wallet ridge and who had mounted to the barriersd' italie by way of the boulevard reached a point where it might be said that paris disappeared
it was no longer solitude for there were passersby it was not the country for there were houses and streets it was not the city for the streets had ritz like highways and the grass grew in them it was not a village the houses were too lofty
what was it then
it was an inhabited spot where there was no one it was a desert place where there was someone it was a boulevard of the great city a street of paris more wild at night than the forest more gloomy by day than a cemetery
it was the old quarter of the march eaux chevaux
the rambler if he risked himself outside the four decrepit walls of this march eaux chevaux if he consented even to pass beyond the rue du petit ban quiet after leaving on his rights garden protected by high falls then a field in which ran bark mills rose like gigantic beaver hits then an enclosure encumbered with timber with a heap of stumps sawdust and shavings on which stood a large dog barking then along low utterly dilapidated wall with a little black door in mourning laden with mosses which were covered with flowers in the spring then in the most deserted spot a frightful and decrepit building on which ran the inscription in large letters post nobilis this daring rambler would have reached little known latitudes at the corner of the rue des fitness aunt marcel
there near a factory and between two garden walks there could be seen at that epoch a mean building which at the first glance seemed as small as a thatched novel and which was in reality as large as a cathedral
it presented its side and table to the public road hence its apparent diminutive news
nearly the whole of the house was hidden
only the door and one window could be seen
this novel was only one story high
the first detail that struck the observer was that the door could never have been anything but the door of a novel while the window if it had been carved out of dressed stone instead of being on rough masonry might have been the lattice of a lordly mansion
the door was nothing but a collection of work eaten plan is roughly bound together by cross beams which resembled roughly new blogs
it opened directly on a steep staircase of lofty steps muddy chalky plaster stained dusty steps of the same width as itself which could be seen from the street running straight up like a ladder and disappearing in the darkness between two walls
the top of the shapeless bay into which this door shut was masked by a narrows dangling in the centre of which a triangular hole had been sawed which serves both as socket and air hole when the door was closed
on the inside of the door the figures had been traced with a couple of strokes of a brush dipped in ink and above the scan to ing the same hand had daubed the number so that one hesitated
where was one
above the door it said number the inside replied no number
no one knows what dust colored figures were suspended like draperies from the triangular opening
the window was large sufficiently elevated garnished with venetian blinds and with a grant in large square pages only these large pages were suffering from various sounds which were both concealed and betrayed by an ingenious paper bandage
and the blinds dislocated and un pasted threatened passersby rather than screened the occupants
the horizontal slats were missing here and there and had been naively replaced with boards nailed on perpendicularly so that what began as a blind ended as a shutter
this door with an unclean and this window with an honest though dilapidated air thus be held on the same house produced the effect of two incomplete beggars walking side by side with different niehs beneath the same rate the one having always been a mendicant and the other having once been a gentleman
the staircase led to a very fast edifice which resembled a shed which had been converted into a house
this edifice had for its intestinal tube a long corridor on which opened to right and left sorts of compartments of varied dimensions which were inhabitable under stress of circumstances and rather more like stalls than cells
these chambers received their light from the vague waste grounds in the neighborhood
all this was dark disagreeable san melancholy sepulchral traversed according as the crevices lay in the roof or in the door by cold days or by icy wind s
an interesting and picturesque peculiarity of this sort of dwelling is the enormous size of the spiders
to the left of the entrance door on the boulevards i read about the height of a man from the ground a small window which had been walked up formed a square niche full of stones which the children had thrown there as they passed by
a portion of this building has recently been demolished
from what still remains of it one can form a judgment as to what it was informed days
as a while it was not over a hundred years old
a hundred years is youth in a church and are in a house
it seems as though man's lodging partook of his ephemeral character and god's house of his eternity
the post men called the house number but it was known in the neighborhood as the gorge au house
let us explains hence this appellation was derived
collectors of petty details who become herbalists of anecdotes and prick slippery dates into their memories with a link now that there was in paris during the last century about two attorneys at the state let named one corbeau raven the other regard fox
the two names had been forestalled by la fontaine
the opportunity was too fine for the lawyers they made the most of it
a parody was immediately put in circulation in the galleries of the courthouse in verses that limped a little maitre corbeau sur un dossier perch even aim dance on freund saisie execu you remain re regard parl' of rural leche luigi tape up reece the histoire he
bonjour
etc.
the two honest practitioners embarrassed by the tests and finding the hearing of their heads interfered with by the shouts of laughter which followed them resolved to get rid of their names and hit upon the expedient of applying to the king
their petition was presented to louis xv
in the same day when the papal nuncio on the one hand and the cardinal de la roche at mon on the other both devoutly kneeling were each engaged in putting on in his majesty's presence a slipper on the bare feet of madame du barry who had just got out of bed
the king who was laughing continued to laugh passed gayly from the two bishops to the two lawyers and bestowed on these limbs of the law their former names or nearly si
by the king's command maitre for best was permitted to add a tail to his initial letter and to call himself for beau
maitre d wharf was less lucky all he obtained was leave to place a pin front of his wand to call himself pre hard so that the second hand fire almost as much resemblance as the first
now according to local tradition this maitre for beau had been the proprietor of the building numbered on the boulevard del' hopital
he was even the author of the monumental window
hence the edifice bore the name of the gorge au house
opposite this house among the trees of the boulevard rose a great elm which was three quarters dead almost directly facing it opens the rue de la barriers dec gobelins a street then without houses unpaved planted with unhealthy trees which was green or muddy according to the season and which ended squarely in the exterior wall of paris
an odor of copper as issued in puffs from the roots of the neighboring factory
the barrier was close at hand
in the city walk was still in existence
this barrier itself evoked gloomy fancies in the mind
it was the road to give yes
it was through it that under the empire and the restoration prisoners condemned to death reentered paris on the day of their execution
it was there that about was committed that mysterious assassination called the assassination of the fontainebleau barrier whose authors justice was never able to discover a melancholy problem which has never been elucidated a frightful enigma which has never been in riddled
take a few steps and you come upon that fatal the croyle barre where kovach stabbed the goat girl of ivry to the sound of thunder as in the melodramas
a few paces more and you arrive at the abominable poll added elms of the barriers saint jacques that expedient of the philanthropist to conceal the scaffold that miserable and shameful place de grove of a shop keeping and bourgeois society which recoiled before the death penalty neither daring to abolish it with grandeur not to uphold it with authority
leaving aside this place saint jacques which was as it were predestined and which has always been horrible probably the most mournful spot on that mournful boulevard seven and thirty years ago was the spot which even today is so in attract one where stood the building number
bourgeois houses only began to spring up there twenty five years later
the place was unpleasant
in addition to the gloomy thoughts which assailed one there one was conscious of being between the wallet ridge a glimpse of showed one could be seen and nicer re whose outskirts one was fairly touching that is to say between the madness of women and the madness of men
as far as the eye could see one could perceive nothing but the abattoirs the city wall and the fronts of a few factories yes em blind barracks or monasteries everywhere about stood novels rubbish ancient walls blackened like cere cloths new white walls like winding sheets everywhere parallel rows of trees buildings erected on alone flat constructions long cold rows and the melancholy sadness or right angles
no fan unevenness of the ground not as a price in the architecture not a fold
the ensemble was glacial regular hideous
nothing oppresses the heart like symmetry
it is because symmetry is ennui and ennui is at the very foundation of grief
despair yawns
something more terrible than a hell where one suffers may be imagined and that is a hell where one is bored
if such a hell existed that bit of the boulevard del' hopital might have formed the entrance to it
nevertheless at nightfall at the moment when the daylight is vanishing especially in winter at the hour when the twilight breeze tears from the elms their last russet leaves when the darkness is deep and charles a. or when the moon and the wind are making openings in the clouds and losing themselves in the shadows this boulevard suddenly becomes frightful
the black lines sink inwards and are lost in the shades like morsels of the infinite
the passerby can not refrain from recalling the innumerable traditions of the place which are connected with the gibbet
the solitude of this spot where so many crimes have been committed had something terrible about it
one almost had a presentiment of meeting with traps in that darkness all the confused forms of the darkness seemed suspicious and the long hollow square of which one caught a glimpse between each tree seemed graves by day it was ugly in the evening me own fully by night it was sinister
in summer at twilight one saw here and there are sold women seated at the foot of the elm on benches mouldy with rain
these good old women were fond of begging
however this quarter which had a superannuated rather than an antique air was tending even then to transformation
even at that time anyone who was desirous of seeing it had to make haste
each day some detail of the whole effect was disappearing
for the last twenty years the station of the orleans railway has stood beside the old faubourg and distracted it as it does today
wherever it is placed on the borders of a capital a railway station is the death of a suburb and the birth of a city
it seems as though around these great centres of the movements of a people the earth full of terms trembled and yawned to engulf the ancient dwellings of men and to allow new ones to spring for that the rattle of these powerful machines at the breath of these monstrous horses of civilization which devour coal and vomit fire
the old houses stumble and new ones rise
since the orleans railway has invaded the region of the wallet ridge the ancient narrow streets which adjoin the most's saint victor and the jardin des plantes tremble as they are violently traversed three or four times each day by those currents of coach coaches and omnibuses which in a given time crowd back the houses to the right and the left for there are things which are odd when said that are rigorously exact and just as it is true to say that in large cities the sun makes the southern fronts of houses to vegetate and grow it is certain that the frequent passage of vehicles enlarge's streets
the symptoms of a new life are evident
in this old provincial quarter in the wildest books the pavement shows itself the sidewalks begin to crawl and to grow longer even where there are as yet no pedestrians
one morning a memorable morning in july black pots of bitumen were seen smoking therein that day it might be said that civilization had arrived in the rue del' our fine and that paris had entered the suburb of saint marceau
chapter ii am est girls legs a warbler it was in front of this for beau house that jean valjean halted
like wild birds he had chosen this desert place to construct his next
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket drew out a sort of a passkey opened the door entered closed it again carefully and ascended the staircase still carrying cosette
at the top of the stairs he drew from his pocket another key with which he opened another door
the chamber which he entered and which he closed again instantly was a kind of moderately spacious attic furnished with a mattress laid on the floor stable and several chairs active in which a fire was burning and whose embers were visible stood in one corner
a lantern of the boulevard cast a vague light into this poor room
at the extreme end there was a dressing room with a folding bed jean valjean carried the child to this bed and laid her down there without waking her
he struck a match and lighted a candle
all this was prepared beforehand in the table and as he had done on the previous evening he began to scrutinize cosette's face with a gaze full of ecstasy in which the expression of kindness and tenderness almost amounted to aberration
the little girl with that tranquil confidence which belongs only to extreme strength and extreme weakness had fallen asleep without knowing with whom she was and continued to sleep without knowing where she was
jean valjean bent down and missed that child's hand
nine months before he had kissed the hand of the mother who had also just fallen asleep
the same sav piercing religious sentiment filled his heart
he knelt beside cosette's bed
it was broad daylight and the child still slept
asa gray of the december sun penetrated the window of the attic and lay upon the ceiling in long threads of light and shade
all at once a heavily laden carrier's cart which was passing along the boulevard shook the trail he'd like a slap of thunder and made it quiver from top to bottom
yes madame
cried cosette waking with a start here i am
here i am
and she sprang out of bed her eyes still half shut with the heaviness of sleep extending her arms towards the corner of the wall
ah
mon dieu my broom
said she
sheplers d her eyes wide now and beheld the smiling countenance of jean valjean
ah
so it is true
said the child
good morning monsieur
children accept joy and happiness instantly and familiarly being themselves by nature joy and happiness
cosette caught sight of catherine at the foot of her bed and took possession of her and as she played she put a hundred questions to jean valjean
where was she
was paris very large
was madame the hardier very far away
was due to go back
etc.
etc.
all at once she exclaimed how pretty it is here
it was a frightful hole but she felt free
must i sweep
she resumed at last
play
said jean valjean
the day passed this
cosette without troubling herself to understand anything was inexpressibly happy with that doll and that kind man
chapter iii two misfortunes make one piece of good fortune on the following morning at daybreak jean valjean was still by cosette's bed side he watched there motionless waiting for her to wake
some new thing has come into his soul
jean valjean had never loved anything for twenty five years he had been alone in the world
he had never been father lover husband friend
in the prison he had been vicious gloomy chaste ignorant and shy
the heart of that ex convicts awful lot virginity
his sister and his sister's children had left him only a vague and far off memory which had finally almost completely vanished he had made every effort to find them and not having been able to find them he had forgotten them
human nature is made thus the other tender emotions of his youth if he had ever had any had fallen into an abyss
when he saw cosette when he had taken possession of her carried her off and delivered her he felt his heart moved within him
all the passion and affection within him awoke and rushed towards that child
he approached the bed where she lay sleeping and trembled with joy
he suffered all the pangs of a mother and he knew not what it meant for that great and singular movement of a heart which begins to love is a very obscure and a very sweet thing
poor old man with a perfectly new heart
only as he was five and fifty and co serve eight years of ate all that might have been love in the whole course of his life flower together into a sort of ineffable light
it was the second white apparition which he had encountered
the bishop had caused the dawn of virtue to rise of his horizon cosette caused the dawn of love to rise
the early days passed in this dazzled state
cosette on her side had also unknown to herself become another being poor little thing
she was so little when her mother left her that she no longer remembered her
like all children who resemble young shoots of the vine which cling to everything she had tried to love she had not succeeded
all had repulsed her the then add iers their children other children
she had loved the dog and he had died after which nothing and nobody would have anything to do with her
it is a sad thing to say and we have already intimated it that at eight years of age her heart was cold
it was not her fault it was not the faculty of loving that she lacked a law
it was the possibility
thus from the very first day all her sentient and thinking powers loved this kind man
she felt that which she had never felt before a sensation of expansion
the man no longer produced on her the effect of being old or poor she thought jean valjean handsome just as she thought the novel pretty
these are the effects of the dawn of childhood of joy
the novelty of the earth and of life counts for something here
nothing is so charming as the coloring reflection of happiness in a target
we all have in our past a delightful garret
nature a difference of fifty years had set a profound gulf between jean valjean and cosette destiny filled in this gulf
destiny suddenly united and seeded with its irresistible power these two uprooted existences differing in age alike in sorrow
one in fact completed the other
cosette's instinct sought a farmer as jean valjean's instinct sought a child
to meet was to find each other
at the mysterious moment when their hands touched they were welded together
when these two souls perceived each other they recognized each other as necessary to eachother and embrace x each other closely
taking the words in their most comprehensive and absolute sense we may say that separated from everyone by the walls of the tomb jean valjean was the widower and cosette was the orphan this situation caused jean valjean to become cosette's father after a celestial fashion
and in truth the mysterious impression produced on cosette in the depths of the forest of chelles by the hand of jean valjean grasping here in the dark was not an illusion but a reality
the entrance of that man into the destiny of that child had been the advent of god
moreover jean valjean had chosen his refuge well
there he seemed perfectly secure
the chamber with a dressing room which he occupied with cosette was the one whose window opened on the boulevard
this being the only window in the house to neighbors' glances were to be feared from across the way or at the side
the ground floor of numbers sort of dilapidated penthouse served as a wagon house for market gardeners and no communication existed between it and the first story
it was separated by the flooring which had neither traps not stairs and which formed the diaphragm of the building as it were
the first story contained as we have said numerous chambers and several attics only one of which was occupied by the old woman who took charge of jean valjean's house keeping all the rest was uninhabited
it was this old woman ornamented with the name of the principal lodger and in reality intrusted with the functions of port read who had let him the lodging on christmas eve
he had represented himself to get as a gentleman of means who had been ruined by spanish bonds who was coming there to live with his little daughter
he had paid her six months in advance and had commissioned the old woman to furnish the chamber and dressing room as we have seen
it was this good woman who had lighted the fire in the stove and prepared everything on the evening of their arrival
week followed week these two beings led a happy life in that novel
cosette laughed shattered and sang from daybreak
children have their morning song as well as birds
it sometimes happened that jean valjean clasped her tiny red hand all cracked with ship blaine and kissed it
the poor child who was used to being beaten did not know the meaning of this and ran away in confusion
at times she became serious and stared at her little black gown
cosette was no longer in rats she was in mourning
she had emerged from misery and she was entering into life
jean valjean had undertaken to teach her to read
sometimes as he made the child spell he remembered that it was with the idea of doing evil that he had learned to read in prison
this idea has ended in teaching a child to read
then the ex convict smiled with the pensive smile of the angels
he felt in its premeditation from in high the will of someone who was not man and he became absorbed in're very
good thoughts have their abysses as well as evil ones
to teach rosette to read and to let her play this constitutes nearly the whole of jean valjean's existence
and then he talked of her mother and he made her pray
she called him father and knew no other name for him
he passed hours in watching her dressing and undressing her doll and in listening to her prattle
life hence forth appeared to him to be full of interest men seemed to him good and must be no longer reproached anyone in thought he saw no reason why he should not live to be a very old man now that this child loved him
he saw a whole future stretching out before him illuminated by cosette as by a charming light
the best of us are not exempt from egotistical thoughts
at times he reflected with a sort of joy that she would be ugly
this is only a personal opinion but to utter our whole thought at the point where jean valjean had arrived when he began to love cosette it is by no means clear to us that he did not need this encouragement in order that he might persevere in well doing
he had just viewed the malice of men and the misery of society under a new aspect incomplete aspects which unfortunately only exhibited one side of the truth the fate of woman as summed up in fan time and public authority as personified in javert
he had returned to prison this time for having done right he had quan few fresh bitterness disgust and lassitude were overpowering him even the memory of the bishop probably suffered a temporary eclipse though sure to reappear later in luminous and triumphant but after all that sacred memory was growing rim
who knows whether jean valjean had not been on the eve of growing discouraged and of falling once more
he loved and grew strong again
alas
he walked with no less in decision than cosette
he protected her and she strengthened yim
thanks to him she could walk through life thanks to her he could continue in virtue
he was that child's stay and she was his prop
oh unfathomable and divine mystery of the balances of destiny
chapter iv the remarks of the principal tenant jean valjean was prudent enough never to go out by day
every evening at twilight he walked for an hour or two sometimes alone often with cosette seeking the most deserted side alleys of the boulevard and entering churches at nightfall
he liked to go to saint medard which is the nearest church
when he did not take cosette with him she remained with the old woman but the child's delight was to go out with the goodman
she preferred an hour with him to all her rapturous here are tea with catherine
he held her hand as they walked and said sweet things to her
it turned out that cosette was a very gay little person
the old woman attended to the housekeeping and cooking and went to market
they lived soberly always having a little fire but like people in very moderate circumstances
jean valjean had made no alterations in the furniture as it was the first day he had merely had the glass door leading to cosette's dressing room replaced by a solid door
he still wore his yellow coat his black breeches and his old hat
in the street he was taken for a poor man
it sometimes happened that kind hearted women turned back to bestow a sou on him
jean valjean accepted the sky with a deep now
it also happened occasionally that he encountered some poor wretch asking aims then he looked behind him to make sure that no one was observing him stealthily approached the unfortunate man put a piece of money into his hand often a silver coin and walked rapidly away
this had its disadvantages
he began to be known in the neighborhood under the name of the beggar who gives alj's
the old principal lodger across looking creature who was thoroughly permeated so far as her neighbors were concerned with the inquisitiveness peculiar to envious persons scrutinized jean valjean a great deal without his suspecting the fact
she was a little feat which rendered her talkative
there remained to her from her past two teeth one above the other below which she was continually knocking against each other
she had questioned cosette who had not been able to tell her anything since she knew nothing herself except that she had come from mont vermeil
one morning this spywae jean valjean with an air which struck the old gps quo as peculiar entering one of the uninhabited compartments of the novel
she followed him with the step of an old cat and was able to observe him without being seen through a crack in the door which was directly opposite him
jean valjean had his back turned towards this door by way of greater security to count
the old woman saw him fumble in his pocket and draw thence a case scissors and thread then he began to rip the lining of one of the skirts of his coat and from the opening he took a bit of yellowish paper which he unfolded
the old woman recognized with terror the fact that it was a bank bill for a thousand francs
it was the second or third only that she has seen in the course of her existence
she fled in alarm
a moment later jean valjean accosted her and asked her to go and get this thousand franc bill changes for him adding that it was his quarterly income which he had received the day before
where
thought the old woman
he did not go out until sixo'clock in the evening and the government bank certainly is not open at that hour
the old woman went to get the bill changed and mentioned her surmises
that thousand franc note commented on and multiplied produces a vast amount of terrified discussion among the gossips of the rue des vignes saint marcel
a few days later it chanced that jean valjean was sawing some wood in his shirt sleeves in the corridor
the old woman was in the chamber putting things in order
she was alone
cosette was occupied in admiring the wood as it was sawed
the old woman caught sight of the boat hanging on a ball and examined it
the lining had been sewed up again
the good woman dept of it carefully and thought she observed in the skirts and refers thicknesses of paper
more thousand franc bank bills no doubt
she also noticed that there were all sorts of things in the pockets
not only the needles thread and scissors which she had seen but a big pocket books very large knife and a suspicious circum stance several five of various colors
each pocket of this coat had the air of being in a manner provided against unexpected accidents
thus the inhabitants of the house reached the past days of winter
chapter va five franc piece falls on the ground and produces a tumult near saint medard's church there was a poor man who was in the habit of crouching on the brink of a public well which had been condemned and on whom jean valjean was fond of bestowing charity
he never passed this man without giving him a few sous
sometimes he spoke to him
those who envied this mendicant said that he belonged to the police
he was an ex beadle of seventy five who was constantly mumbling his prayers
one evening as jean valjean was passing by when he had not cosette with him he saw the beggar in his usual place beneath the lantern which had just been lighted
the man seemed engaged in prayer according to his custom and was much bent over
jean valjean stepped up to him and placed his customary aims in his hand
the mendicant raised his eyes suddenly stated intently at jean valjean then dropped his head quickly
this movement was like a flash of lightning
jean valjean was seized with a shudder
it seemed to him that he had just caught sight by the light of the street lantern not of the placid and beaming visage of the old beadle but of a well known and startling face
he experienced the same impression that one would have on finding one's self all of a sudden face to face in the dark with a tiger
here coiled terrified petrified dating neither to breathe to speak to remain not to view staring at the beggar who had dropped his head which was enveloped in a rag and no longer appeared to know that he was there
at this strange moment an instinct possibly the mysterious instinct of self preservation restrained jean valjean from uttering a word
the beggar had the same figure the same rags the same appearance as he had every day
bah
said jean valjean i am had
i am dreaming
impossible
and he returned profoundly troubled
he hardly dared to confess even to himself that the fact which he thought he had seen was the face of javert
that night on thinking the matter over he regretted not having questioned the man in order to force him to raise his head a second time
on the following day at nightfall he went back
the beggar was at his post
good day my goodman said jean valjean resolutely handing him as ok
the beggar raised his head and replied in a whining voice thanks my good sur
it was unmistakably the ex beadle
jean valjean felt completely reassured
he began to laugh
how the deuce could i have thought that i saw javert there
he thought
ami going to lose my eyesight now
and he thought no more about it
a few days afterwards it might have been at eighto'clock in the evening he was in his room and engaged in making cosette spell a loud when he heard the house door open and then shut again
this struck him as singular
the old woman who was the only inhabitant of the house except himself always went to bed at nightfall so that she might not burn out her candles
jean valjean made a sign to cosette to be quiet
he heard someone ascending the stairs
it might possibly be the old woman who might have fallen ill and have been out to the apothecary's
jean valjean listened
the step was heavy and sounded like that of a man but the old woman aires your shoes and there is nothing which so strongly resembles the step of a man as that of an old woman
nevertheless jean valjean blew out his candle
he had sent cosette to bed saying to her in a low voice get into bed very softly and as he kissed her brow the steps paused
jean valjean remained silent motionless with his back towards the door seated on the chair from which he had not stirred and holding his breath in the dark
after the expiration of a rather long interval he turned round as he heard nothing more and as he raised his eyes towards the door of his chamber he saw a light through the keyhole
this light formed a sort of sinister star in the blackness of the door and the wall
there was evidently someone there who was holding a candle in his hand and listening
several minutes elapsed this and the light retreated
but he heard no sound of footsteps which seemed to indicate that the person who had been listening at the door had removed his shoes
jean valjean threw himself all dressed as he was on his bed and could not close his eyes all night
at daybreak just as he was falling into a dose through fatigue he was awakened by the creaking of a door which opened on some attic at the end of the corridor then he heard the same masculine footstep which had ascended the stairs on the preceding evening
the step was approaching
he sprang off the bed and applied his eye to the keyhole which was tolerably large hoping to see the person who had made his way by night into the house and had listened at his door as he passed
it was a man in fact who passed this time without pausing in front of jean valjean's chamber
the corridor was too dark to allow of the person's face being distinguished but when the man reached the staircase a day of light from without made it stand out like a silhouette and jean valjean had a complete view of his back
the man was of lofty stature clad in a long frock coat with a cudgel under his arm
the formidable neck and shoulders belonged to javert
jean valjean might have attempted to catch another glimpse of him through his window opening on the boulevard but he would have been obliged to open the window he dared not
it was evident that this man has entered with a key and like himself
who had given him that key
what was the meaning of this
when the old woman came to do the work at seveno'clock in the morning jean valjean cast a penetrating glance on her but he did not question her
the good woman appeared as usual
as she swept up she remarked to him possibly monsieur may have heard someone come in last night
at that age and on that boulevard eighto'clock in the evening was the dead of the night
that is true by the way he replied in the most natural to be possible
who was it
it was a new lodger who has come into the house said the old woman
and what is his name
idon't know exactly dumont or daimon for some name of that sort
and who is this monsieur dumont
the old woman gazed at him with her little polecat eyes and answered a gentleman of property like yourself
perhaps she had no ulterior meaning
jean valjean though the perceived one
when the old woman had taken her departure he did to a hundred francs which he had in a cupboard into a roll and put it in his pocket
in spite of all the precautions which he took in this operation so that he might not be heard rattling silver a hundred so i piece escaped from his hands and rolled noisily on the floor
when darkness came on he descended and carefully scrutinized both sides of the boulevard
he saw no one
the boulevard appeared to be absolutely deserted
it is true that a person can conceal himself behind trees
he went upstairs again
coke
he said to cosette
he took her by the hand and they both went out
book fifth
for a black hung a mute pack chapter i. the zigzags of strategy an observation here becomes necessary in view of the pages which the reader is about to peruse and of others which will be met with further on
the author of this book who regrets the necessity of mentioning himself has been absent from paris for many years
paris has been transformed since he quitted it
a new city has arisen which is after a fashion unknown to him
there is no need for him to say that he loves paris paris is his mind's natal city
in consequence of demolitions and reconstructions the paris of his youth that paris which he bore a way religiously in his memory is now sparks of days gone by
he must be permitted to speak of that paris as though it still existed
it is possible that when the author conducts his readers to a spot and says in such a street there stands such and such a house neither street nor house will any longer exist in that locality
readers may verify the facts if they care to take the trouble
for his own part he is unacquainted with the new paris and he writes with the old paris before his eyes in an illusion which is precious to him
it is a delight to him to dream that there still lingers behind him something of that which he beheld when he was in his own country and that all has not banished
so long as you go and come in your native land you imagine that those streets are a matter of ib difference to you that those windows those roles and those doors are nothing to you that those walls are strangers to you that those trees are merely the first encountered haphazard that those houses which you do not enter are useless to you that the pavements which you tread are merely stones
later on when you are no longer there you perceive that the streets are dear to you that you miss those roots those doors and that those walls are necessary to you those trees are well beloved by you that you entered those houses which you never entered every day and that you have left a part of your heart of your blood of your soul in those pavements
all those places which you no longer behold which you may never behold again perchance and whose memory you have cherished take on a melancholy charm recur to your mind with the melancholy of an apparition make the holy land visible to you and are so to speak the very form of france and you love them and you call them up as they are as they were and you persist in this and you will submit to no change for you are attached to the figure of your fatherland as to the face of your mother
may we then be permitted to speak of the past in the present
that said weber the reader to take note of it and we continue
jean valjean instantly quitted the boulevard and plunged into the streets taking the most intricate lines which he could devise returning on his track at times to make sure that he was not being followed
illustration the black hunt b. black hunt this manoeuvre is peculiar to the hunted star
on soil where an imprint of the track may be left this manoeuvre possesses among other advantages that of receiving the huntsmen and the dogs by throwing them on the wrong scent
i mcenery this is called false're in buchman t
the moon was full that night
jean valjean was not sorry for this
the moon still very close to the horizon cast great masses of light and shadow in the streets
jean valjean could glide along close to the houses on the dark side and yet keep watch on the light side
he did not perhaps take sufficient py into consideration the fact that the dark side escaped him
still in the deserted lanes which lie near the rue police au he thought he felt certain that no one was following him
cosette walked on without asking any questions
the sufferings of the first six years of her life has instilled something passive into her nature
moreover and this is a remark to which we shall frequently have occasion to recur she had grown used without being herself aware of it to the peculiarities of this goodman and to the freaks of destiny
and then she was with him and she felt safe
jean valjean knew no more where he was going than did cosette
he trusted in god as she trusted in him
it seemed as though he also were clinging to the hand of someone greater than himself he thought he felt a being leading him though invisible
however he had no settled idea no plan no. project
he was not even absolutely sure that it was javert and then it might have been javert without javert knowing that he was jean valjean
was not be disguised
was not he believed to be dead
still sheer things had been going on for several days
he wanted no more of them
he was determined not to return to the gorge au house
like the wild animal chased from it's lair he was seeking a hole in which he might hide until he could find one where he might dwell
jean valjean described many and varied labyrinths in them out regard quarter which was already asleep as though the discipline of the middle ages and the yoke of the curfew still existed be combined in various manners with cunning strategy the eu even side and the russo peau the rue du bay golf swing victor and the rue du phi tcl's emits
there are lodging houses in this locality but he did not even enter one finding nothing which suited him
he had no doubt that if anyone had chances to be upon his track they would have lost it
as eleveno'clock struck from saint etienne dumont he was traversing the rue de pontoise in front of the office of the commissary of police situated at no
a few moments later the instinct of which we have spoken above made him turn round
at that moment he was distinctly thanks to the commissary's lantern which betrayed them three men who were following him closely pass one after the other under that lantern on the dark side of the street
one of the three entered the alley leading to the commissary's house
the one who marched at their head struck him as decidedly suspicious
come child he said to cosette and he made haste to quit the fuel on to use
he took a circuit turned into the passage des patriarchs's which was closed on account of the hour strode along the rue del' does de bois and the rue del' arba pete and plunged into the rue des postes
at that time there was a square formed by the intersection of streets where the college rollin stands today and where the rue neuve sainte genevieve turns off
it is understood of course that the rue neuve sainte genevieve is an old street and that a posting chaise does not pass through the rue des postes once in ten years
in the thirteenth century this rue des postes was inhabited by potters and its real name let us despots
the moon cast alibi voight in to this open space
jean valjean went into ambush in a doorway calculating that if the men were still following him he could not fail to get a good look at them as they traversed this illuminated space
in point of fact three minutes had not elapsed when the men made their appearance
there were four of them now
all we get all dressed in long browncoats with round hats and huge cudgels in their hands
their great stature and their vast fists rendered them no less alarming than did their sinister stride through the darkness
one would have pronounced them four spectres disguised as bourgeois
they halted in the middle of the space and formed a group like men in consultation
they had an air of indecision
the one who appeared to be their leader turned round and pointed hastily with his right hand in the direction which jean valjean had taken another seemed to indicate the contrary direction with considerable obstinacy
at the moment when the first man wheeled round the moon fell fill in his face
jean valjean recognized javert perfectly
chapter iii his lucky that the pontd' austerlitz bears carriages uncertainty was at an end for jean valjean fortunately it still lasted for the men
he took advantage of their hesitation
it was time lost for them but gained for him
he slipped from under the gate where he had concealed himself and went down the rue des postes towards the region of the jardin des plantes
cosette was beginning to be tired
he took her in his arms and carried her
there were no passersby and the street lanterns had not been lighted on account of the're being a moon
here doubled his pace
in a few strides he had reached the goblet potteries on the front of which the moonlight rendered distinctly legible the ancient inscription de goblet files's stick la fabrique venez choisir des crushes et des brood despite a fleurs de stu taux del' afrique
a tour de mantle coeur gene desc a breaux
he left behind him the rue de la diet then the fountain saint victor skirted the jardin des plantes by the lower streets and reached the quay
there he turned round
the quay was deserted
the streets were deserted
there was no one behind him
he drew a long breath
he gained the pontd' austerlitz
tools were still collected there at that epoch
he presented himself at the toll office and handed over a sou
it is two sous said the old soldier in charge of the bridge
you are carrying a child who can walk
pay for two
repair vexed that his passage should have aroused remark
every flight should be an imperceptible slipping away
a heavy cart was crossing the seine at the same time as himself and on its way like him to the right bank
this was of use to him
he could traverse the bridge in the shadow of the cart
towards the middle of the bridge cosette whose feet were gem in bed wanted to walk
he set her on the ground and took her hand again
the bridge once crossed he perceived some timber yard song is right
he directed his course thither
in order to reach them it was necessary to risk himself in a tolerably large in sheltered and illuminated space
he did not hesitate
those who were on how track had evidently lost the scent and jean valjean believed himself to be out of danger
hunger yes followed no
a little street the rue du chem invert saint antoine opened out between two timber yard's enclosed in walls
this street was dark and narrow and seemed made expressly for him
before entering it be cast a glance behind him
from the point where he stood he could see the whole extent of the pontd' austerlitz
four shadows were just entering on the bridge
these shadows had their backs turned to the jardin des plantes and were on their way to the right bank
these four shadows were the four men
jean valjean shuddered like the wild beast which is recaptured
one hope remained to him it was that the men had not perhaps stepped on the bridge and had not caught sight of him while he was crossing the large illuminated space holding cosette by the name
in that case by plunging into the little street before him he might escape if he could reach the timber yard's the marshes the market gardens the uninhabited ground which was not built upon
it seemed to him that he might commit himself to that silent little street
he entered it
chapter iii to wit the plan of paris in three hundred paces further on he arrived at a point where the street forked
it separated into two streets which ran in a slanting line one to the right and the other to the left
jean valjean had before him what resembled the two branches of ay
which should be choose
he did not hesitate but took the one on the right
why
because that to the left ran towards a suburb that is to say towards inhabited regions and the right branch towards the open country that is to say towards deserted regions
however they no longer walked very fast
cosette' space retarded jean valjean's
he took her up and carried her again
cosette laid her head on the shoulder of the goodman and said not a word
he turned round from time to time and looked behind him
he took care to keep always on the dark side of the street
the street was straight in his rear
the first two or three times that he turned round he saw nothing the silence was profound and he continued his march somewhat reassured
all at once on turning round he thought he perceived in the portion of the street which he had just passed through far off in the obscurity something which was moving
he rushed forward precipitate it rather than walked hoping to find some side street to make his escape through it and thus to break his scent once more
he arrived at a wall
this wall however did not absolutely prevent further progress it was a wall which border was transverse street in which the one he had taken ended
here again he was obliged to come to a decision should he go to the right or to the left
her lancer to the right
the fragmentary lane was prolonged between buildings which were either sheds or barns then ended at a blind alley
the extremity of the cul de sac was distinctly visible a lofty white wall
he glanced to the left
on that side the page was open and about two hundred paces further on ran into a street of which it was the affluent
in that so delay safety
at the moment when jean valjean was meditating a turn to the left in an effort to reach the street which he saw at the end of the land he perceived a sort of motionless black statue at the corner of the land and the street towards which he was on the point of directing his steps
it was someone a man who had evidently just been posted there and who was barring the passage and waiting
jean valjean recoiled
the point of paris where jean valjean found himself situated between the faubourg saint antoine and lara pee is one of those which recent improvements have transformed from hop to bottom resulting in disfigurement according to come and in a transfiguration according to others
the market gardens the timber yards and the old buildings have been effaced
today there are brand new wide streets arenas circuses hippodrome's railway stations and a prison max as there progress as the reader sees with its antidote
half a century ago in that ordinary popular tongue which is all compounded of traditions which persists in calling the institut les quatre nations and the opera comique feud' eau the precise spot whither jean valjean had arrived was called le petit pic pic
the ports saint jacques the posts paris the barriers dessert ents the porcher on soa ballot fleece lesbins les capucine l. email labour bel' arbre des rack vie la petite pologne these are the names of old paris which survive amid the new
the memory of the populace hovers over these relics of the past
le petit pic pic which moreover hardly ever had any existence and never was more than the outline of a quarter had nearly them on kish aspect of a spanish town
the roads were not much paved the streets were not much built up
with the exception of the two or three streets of which we shall presently speak all was wall and solitude there
not a shop not a vehicle hardly a cave of lighted here and there in the windows all lights extinguished after teno'clock
gardens convents timber yard's marshes occasional lowly dwellings and great wall was high as the houses
such was this quarter in the last century
the revolution snubbed it soundly
the republican government demolished and cut through it
rubbish shoots were established there
thirty years ago this quarter was disappearing under the drawing process of new buildings
today it has been utterly blotted out
the petit pic pic of which no existing plan has preserved a trace is indicated with sufficient clearness in the plan of published at paris by denis thierry rue saint jacques opposite the rue du platte and at lyons by jean for in the mercier day the sign of prudence
petit pic pic had as we have just mentioned ay of streets formed by the rue du chem invert saint antoine which spread out in two branches taking on the left the name or little pic pie street and on the right the name of the rue po monceau
the two limbs if they were connected at the apex ad by a far this bar was called the droit jug
the rue pol once au ended there rue petit pick us passed on and ascended towards the lenoir market
a person coming from the seige reached the extremity of the rue pol once a hand had on his right the rue de out mur turning abruptly at a right angle in front of him the wall of that street and on his rights truncated prolongation of the due droit myr which had no issue and was called the dulce each end of
it was here that jean valjean stood
as we have just said on catching sight of that black silhouette standing on guard at the angle of the rue droit mutant the due petit lisp us here coiled
there could be no doubt of it
that phantom was lying in wait for him
what was metodo
the time for retreating was passed
that which he had perceived in movement an instant before in the distant darkness was javert and his squad without a doubt
javert was probably already at the commencement of the street at whose end jean valjean stood
javert to all appearances was acquainted with this little labyrinth and had taken his precautions by sending one of his men to guard the exit
these surmises which so closely resembled proofs whirled suddenly like a handful of dust caught up by an unexpected bust of wind through jean valjean's mournful brain
he examined the cul de sac gene if there he was cut off
he examined the rifle tit pic pic there stood a sentinel
he saw that black form standing out in relief against the white pavement illuminated by the moon to advance was to fall into this man's hands to retreat was to flung himself into javert's arms
jean valjean felt himself caught as in znet which was slowly contracting he gazed heavenward in despair
chapter iv the groping soft light in order to under stand what follows it is requisite to form an exact idea of the droit kurland and in particular of the angle which one leaves on the left when one emerges from the due pol once akin to this page
from thur lane was a pm pst entirely bordered on the right as far as the the petit pic pushy houses of me an aspect on the left by a solitary building of severe outlines composed of numerous parts which grew gradually higher by a story or two as they approached the eye petit pic pussies so that this building which was very lofty on the rue petit pic pussies was tolerably low on the side adjoining the rue pol once au
there at the angle of which we have spoken it descended to such a degree that it consisted of merely a wall
this wall did not a bit directly on the street it formed a deeply retreating niche concealed by its two corners from two observers who might have been one in the rue pol once with either in the rue de kit mug
beginning with these angles of the niche the wall extended along the rue pol once au as far as a house which bore the number and along the rue de kit mug where the fragment was much shorter as far as the gloomy building which we have mentioned and who's enable it intersected thus forming another retreating angle on the street
this table was sombre of aspect only one window was visible or to speak more correctly two shutters covered with a sheet of zinc and kept constantly closed
the state of the places of which we are here giving a description is rigorously exact and will certainly awaken a very precise memory in the kind of old inhabitants of the quarter
the niche was entirely filled by a thing which resembled a colossal and wretched door it was a vast formless assemblage of perpendicular plan is the upper ones being broader than the lower bound together by long transverse strips of iron
at one side there was a carriage rate of the ordinary dimensions and which had evidently not been cut more than fifty years previously
a linden tree showed its crest above the niche and the wall was covered with ivy on the side of the tiepolo nc day
in the imminent peril in which jean valjean found himself this sombre building had about it a solitary and uninhabited look which tempted him
he ran his eyes rapidly over it he said to himself that if he could contrive to get inside it he might save himself
first he conceived an idea then shops
in the central portion of the front of this building on the rue de kit mug side there were at all the windows of the different stories ancient cistern pipes of lead
the various branches of the pipes which led from one central pipe to all these little basins sketched out a sort of tree on the front
these ramifications of pipes with their hundred elbows imitated those old leafless find stocks which driggs over the fronts of old farm houses
this is des papier with its branches of lead and iron was the first thing that struck jean valjean
he seated cosette with her back against a stone post with an injunction to be silent and ran to the spot where the conduit touched the pavement
perhaps there was some way of climbing up by it and entering the house
but the pipe was dilapidated and past service and hardly hung to its fastenings
moreover all the windows of this silent dwelling were grated with heavy iron bars even the attic windows in the roof
and then the moon fell full upon that facade and the man who was watching at the corner of the street would have seen jean valjean in the act of climbing
and finally what was to be done with cosette
how was due to be drawn up to the top of a three story house
he gave up all idea of climbing by means of the drain pipe and crawled along the wall to get back into the rue pol once au
when he reached the slant of the wall where he had left cosette he noticed that no one could see him there
as we have just explained he was concealed from all eyes no matter from which direction they were approaching besides this he was in the shadow
finally there were two doors perhaps they might be forced
the wall above which he saw the linden tree and the ivy evidently a burger on a garden where he could at least hide himself although there were as yet no leaves on the trees and spend the remainder of the night
time was passing he just act quickly
he felt over the carriage door and immediately recognized the fact that it was impracticable outside and in
he approached the other door with more hope it was frightfully decrepit its very immensity rendered it less solid the planks were rotten the iron bands there were only three of them were rusted
it seemed as though it might be possible to pierced his work eaten barrier
on examining it be found that the door was not a door it has neither hinges de las bars lock not fissure in the middle their on bands traversed it from side to side without any break
through the crevices in the plank she caught a view of un means labs and blocks of stone roughly cemented together which passersby might still have seen there ten years ago
he was forced to acknowledge with consternation that this apparent door was simply the wooden decoration of a building against which it was placed
it was easy to tear off a plank but then one found one's self face to face with a wall
chapter v. which would be impossible with gas lanterns at that moment a heavy and measured sound began to be audible at some distance
jean valjean risked a glance round the corner of the street
seven or eight soldiers drawn up in a platoon had just de boucher into the rue pol once au
he saw the gleam of their bayonets
they were advancing towards him these soldiers at whose head he distinguished javert's tall figure advanced slowly and cautiously
they halted fresh enjoy it was plain that they were searching all the nooks of the walls and all the embr a sures of the doors and alleys
this was some patrol that is very had encountered there could be no mistake as to this surmise and who's said he had demanded
javert's two acolytes were marching in their ranks
at the rate at which they were marching and in consideration of the halts which they were making it would take them about a quarter of an hour to reach the spot where jean valjean stood
it was a frightful moment
a few minutes only separated jean valjean from that terrible precipice which yawned before him for the third time
and the valley snow meant not only the galleys but cosette lost to him forever that is to say a life resembling the interior of a tomb
there was but one thing which was possible
jean valjean had this peculiarity that he carried as one might say two beggar's pouches in one he kept his saintly thoughts in the other the redoubtable talents of a convict
he rummaged in the one of the other according to circumstances
among his other resources thanks to his numerous escapes from the prison at toulon he was as it will be remembered a lazy master in the incredible art of crawling up without ladder or climbing irons by sheer muscular force by leaning on the nape of his neck his shoulders his hips and his knees by helping himself on the rare projections of the stone in the right angle of a wall as high as the sixth story of need be an art which has rendered so celebrated and so alarming that corner of the wall of the son curry erie of paris by which bette molle condemned to death made his escape twenty years ago
jean valjean measured with his eyes the wall above which he espied the linden it was about eighteen feet in height
the angle which it formed with the table of the large building was filled at its lower extremity by a mass of masonry of a triangular shape probably intended to preserve that too convenient corner from the rubbish of those dirty creatures called the passersby
this practice of filling up corners of the wall is much in use in paris
this mass was about five feet in height the space above the summit of this mass which it was necessary to climb was not more than fourteen feet
the wall was surmounted by a flat stone without a coping
cosette was the difficulty for she did not know how to climb a wall
should be abandon her
jean valjean did not once think of that
it was impossible to carry her
a man's whole strength is required to successfully carry out these singular accents
the least burden would disturb his centre of gravity and pull him downwards
a rope would have been required jean valjean had none
where waste to get a rope at midnight in the rue pol once au
certainly if jean valjean had had a kingdom he would have given it for a rope at that moment
all extreme situations have their lightning flashes which sometimes dazzle sometimes illuminate us
jean valjean's despairing glance fell on the street lantern post of the blind alley gene of
at that epoch there were no gaskets in the streets of paris
at nightfall lanterns placed at regular distances were lighted they were ascended and descended by means of a rope which traverses the street from side to side and was adjusted in a groove of the post
the pulley over which this rulers news fastened underneath the lantern in a little iron box the key to which was kept by the lamplighter and the role itself was protected by a metal case
jean valjean with the energy of a supreme struggle crossed the streets to be bound entered the blind alley broke the latch of the little box with the point of his knife and an instant later he was beside cosette once more
he had a rope
these gloomy inventors of expedients work rapidly when they are fighting against fatality
we have already explained that the lanterns had not been lighted that night
the lantern in the cul de sac gene it was this naturally extinct like the rest and one could pass directly under it without even noticing that it was no longer in its place
nevertheless the hour the place the darkness jean valjean's absorption his singular gestures his goings and coming's all had begun to render cost the uneasy
any other child than she would have given vent to pour shrieks long before
she contented herself with plucking jean valjean by thee list of his coat
they could hear the sound of the patrol's approach ever more and more distinctly
father said she in a very low voice i am afraid
who is coming yonder
bush
replied the unhappy man it is madame the barrier
cosette shuddered
he added say nothing
don't interfere with me
if you cry out if you weep the the barrier is lying in wait for you
she is coming to take you back
then without taste but without making a useless movement with firm and curt precision the more remarkable at a moment when the patrol and javert might come upon him at any moment he undid his cravat passed it round cosette's body under the armpits taking care that it should not hurt the choke fastened this cravat to one end of the role by means of that knot which seafaring men dallas wallow in it took the other end of the role in his teeth pulled off his shoes and stockings which he threw over the wall stepped up on the mass of masonry and began to raise himself in the angle of the wall and the table with as much solidity and certainty as though he had the rounds of a ladder under his feet and elbows
half a minute had not elapsed when he was resting on his knees on the wall
cosette gazed at him in stupid amazement without uttering a word
jean valjean's injunction and the name of madame the barrier had chilled her blood
all at once she heard jean valjean's voice crying to her though in a very low to be put your back against the wall
she obeyed
don'ts at a word anddon't be alarmed went on jean valjean
and she felt her self lifted from the ground
before she had time to recover herself she was on the top of the wall
jean valjean grasped her put her on his back took her two tiny hands in his large left hand lay down flat on his stomach and crawled along on top of the wall as far as thecan't
as he had guessed there stood a building whose root started from the top of the wooden barricade and descended to within a very short distance of the ground with a gentle slope which grazed the linden tree
a lucky circumstance for the wall was much higher on this side than on the street side
jean valjean could only see the ground at a great depth below him
he had just reached the slope of the roof and had not yet left the crest of the wall when a violent uproar announced the arrival of the patrol
the thundering voice of javert was audible search the blind alley
the rue de kit mug is guarded
so is the rue petit pic pic
i'll answer for it that held in the blind alley
the soldiers rushed into the negro talley
jean valjean allowed himself to slide down the roof still holding fast to cosette reached the linden tree and leaped to the ground
whether from terror of courage cosette had not breathed a sound though her hands were a little abraded
chapter vi the beginning of an enigma jean valjean found himself in a sort of garden which was very fast and of singular aspect one of those melancholy gardens which seem made to be looked at in winter and at night
this garden was oblong in shape with an alley of large poplars at the further end tolerably tall forest trees in the corners and a jun shared space in the centre where could be seen a very large solitary tree then several fruit trees gnarled and bristling like bushes beds of vegetables a melon patch whose glass frames sparkled in the moonlight and an old well
here and there stood stone benches which seemed black with misc
the alleys were bordered with gloomy and very erect little shrubs
the grass had half taken possession of them and a green mould covered the rest
jean valjean had beside him the building whose roof had served him as a means of descent a pile of favors and behind the favors directly against the walls stone statue whose mutilated face was no longer anything more than a shapeless mask which looked vaguely through the gloom
the building was a sort of ruin where dismantled chambers were distinguishable one of which much encumbered seemed to serve as a shed
the large building on the rue droit but which has a wing on the rue petit pic pic turned two facades at right angles towards this garden
these interior facades were even more tragic than the exterior
all the windows were grated
not a gleam of light was visible at any one of them
the upper story had scuttles like prisons
one of those facades cast its shadow on the other which fell over the garden like an immense black pall
no other house was visible
the bottom of the garden was lost in mist and darkness
nevertheless walls could be confusedly made out which intersected as though there were more cultivated land beyond and the low foods of the rue pol once au
nothing more wild and solitary than this garden could be imagined
there was no one unit which was quite natural in view of the hour but it did not seem as though this slot were made for anyone to walk in even in broad daylight
jean valjean's first care has been to get hold of his shoes and put them on again then to step under the shed with cosette
a man who is fleeing never thinks himself sufficiently hidden
the child whose thoughts were still on the the barrier shared his instinct for withdrawing from sight as much as possible
cosette trembled and pressed close to him
they heard the tumultuous noise of the patrol searching the blind alley and the streets the blows of their bug stocks against the stones have rt's appeals to the police spies whom he had posted and his imprecations mingled with words which could not be distinguished
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it seemed as though that species of stormy do we were becoming more distant
jean valjean held his breath
he had laid his hand lightly on cosette's mouth
however the solitude in which he stood was so strangely calm that this frightful uproar close and furious as it was did not disturb him by so much as the shadow of a misgiving
it seemed as though those walls had been built of the deaf stones of which the scriptures speak
all at once in the midst of this profound calm a fresh sound arose a sound as celestial divine ineffable ravishing as the other had been horrible
it was a hymn which issued from the gloom a dazzling first of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night women's voices but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accents or children voices which are not of the earth and which resemble those that the newborn infant still bears and which the dying man hears already
this song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden
at the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom
cosette and jean valjean fell on their knees
they knew not what it was they knew not where they were but both of them the man and the child the penitent and the innocent felt that they must ineel
these voices had this strange characteristic that they did not prevent the building from seeking to be deserted
it was a supernatural chart in an uninhabited house
while these voices were singing jean valjean thought of nothing
he no longer be held the night he beheld a blue sky
it seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us unfolding
the song died away
it may have lasted a long time
jean valjean could not have told
hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment
all fell silent again
there was no longer anything in the street there was nothing in the garden
that which had menaced that which had reassured him all had vanished
the breeze swayed a few dry weeds on the crest of the wall and they gave out a faint sweet melancholy sound
chapter vii continuation of the enigma the night wind had risen which indicated that it must be between one and twoo'clock in the norming
poor cosette said nothing
as she had seated herself beside him and leaned her head against him jean valjean had fancied that she was asleep
he bent down and looked at her
cosette's eyes were wide open and her thoughtful air pained jean valjean
she was still trembling
are you sleepy
said jean valjean
i am very cold she replied
a moment later she resumed is she still there
who
said jean valjean
madame the barrier
jean valjean had already forgotten the means which he had employed to make cosette keep silent
ah
said he she is gone
you need fear nothing further
the child sighed as though a load had been lifted from her breast
the ground was damp the shed open on all sides the breeze grew more keen every instant
the good man took off his coat and wrapped it round cosette
are you less cold now
said he
oh yes father
we'll wait for me a moment
i will soon be back
he quitted the ruin and crept along the large building seeking a better shelter
he came across doors but they were closed
there were bars at all the windows of the ground floor
just after he had turned the inner angle of the edifice he observed that he was coming to some arched windows where he perceived a light
he stood on tiptoe and peeped through one of these windows
they all opened on a tolerably vast hall paved with large flagstones cut up by arcades and pillars where only a tiny light and great shadows were visible
the light came from a taper which was burning in one corner
the apartment was deserted and nothing was stirring in it
nevertheless by dint of gazing intently he thought he perceived on the ground something which appeared to be covered with a winding sheet and which resembled a human form
this form was lying face downward flat on the pavement with the arms extended in the form or across in the immobility of death
one would have said judging from a sort of serpent which undulated over the floor that this sinister form had a rope round its neck
the whole chamber was bathed in that most of places which are spa rely illuminated which adds to horror
jean valjean often said afterwards that although many funereal spectres had crossed his path in life he had never be held anything more blood cyr doing and terrible than that enigmatic al form accomplishing some inexplicable mystery in that gloomy place and be held this at night
it was alarming to suppose that that thing was perhaps dead and still more alarming to think that it was perhaps alive
he had the courage to plaster his face to the glass and to watch whether the thing would move
in spite of his remaining thus what seemed to him a very long time the outstretched form made no movement
all at once he felt himself over powered by an inexpressible terror and he fled
he began to run towards the shed not daring to look behind him
it seemed to him that if he turned his head he should see that form following him with great strides and saving it's arms
he reached the ruin all out of breath
his knees were giving way beneath him the perspiration was pouring from him
where waste
who could ever have imagined anything like that sort of sepulchre in the midst of paris
what was this strange house
an edifice full of nocturnal mystery calling to souls through the darkness with the voice of angels and when they came offering then abruptly that terrible vision promising to open the radiant portals of heaven and then opening the horrible gates of the tomb
and it actually was an edifice a house which bore a number on the street
it was not a dream
he had to touch the stones to convince himself that such was the fact
cold anxiety uneasiness the emotions of the night had given him a genuine fever and all these ideas were flashing together in his brain
he stepped up to cosette
she was asleep
chapter viii the enigma becomes doubly mysterious the child had laid her head on a store and fallen asleep
he sat down beside her and began to think
little by little as he gazed at her he grew calm and regained possession of his freedom of mind
he clearly perceived this truth the foundation of his life henceforth that so long as she was there so long as he had her near him he should need nothing except for her he should fear nothing except for her
he was not even conscious that he was very cold since he had taken off his coat to cover her
nevertheless athwart this're very into which he had fallen he had heard for some time a peculiar noise
it was like the tinkling of a bell
this sound proceeded from the garden
it could be heard distinctly though faintly
it resembled the faint vague music produced by the bells of cattle at night in the pastures
this noise made valjean turn round
he looked and saw that there was someone in the garden
a being resembling a man was walking amid the bell classed of the melon beds rising shopping halting with regular movements as though he were dragging or spreading out something on the ground
this person appeared to limp
jean valjean shuddered with the continual tremor of the unhappy
for them everything is hostile and suspicious
they distrust the day because it enables people to see them and the night because it aids in surprising them
a little while before he had shivered because the garden was deserted and now he shivered because there was someone there
he fell back from chimerical terror stuff alt errors
he said to himself that javert and the spies had perhaps not taken their departure that they had no doubt left people on the watch in the street that if this man should discover him in the garden he would cry out for help against thieves and deliver him up
he took the sleeping cosette gently in his arms and carried her behind a heap of old furniture which was out of use in the most remote corner of the shed
rosette did not stir
from that point he scrutinized the appearance of the being in the melon patch
the strange thing about it was that the sound of the bell followed each of this man's movements
when the man approached the sound approached when the man retreated the sound retreated if he made any nasty gestures tremolo accompanied the gesture when he halted the sound ceased
it appeared evident that the bell was attached to that man but what could that signify
who was this man who had a bell suspended about him like a ram or a box
as he put these questions to himself he touched cosette's hands
they were icy cold
ah
good god
he cried
he spoke to her in a low voice cosette
she did not open her eyes
he shook her vigorously
she did not wake
issue dead
he said to himself and sprang to his feet quivering from head to foot
the most frightful thoughts rushed pell hell through his mind
there are moments when hideous surmises assail us like a cohort of duties and violently force the partitions of our brains
when those we love are in question our prudence invents a very sort of madness
he remembered that sleep in the open air on a cold night may be fatal
cosette was pale and had fallen at full length on the ground at his feet without a movement
he listened to her breathing she still breathed but with a respiration which seemed to him weak and on the point of extinction
how waste to warm get back to life
how waste to rouse her
all that was not connected with this vanished from his thoughts
he rushed wildly from the ruin
it was absolutely necessary that cosette should be in bed and besides fire in less than a quarter of an hour
chapter ix the man with the bell he walked straight up to the man whom he saw in the garden
he had taken in his hand the roll of silver which was in the pocket of his waistcoat
the man's head was bent down and he did not see him approaching
in a few strides jean valjean stood beside him
jean valjean accosted him with the cry one hundred francs
the manga be a start and raised his eyes
you can earn a hundred francs went on jean valjean if you will grant me shelter for this night
the moon shone full upon jean valjean's terrified countenance
what
so it is too father madeleine
said the man
that name this pronounced at that obscure hour in that unknown spot by that strange man made jean valjean start back
he had expected anything but that
the person who thus addressed him was agent and lake old man dressed almost like a peasant who wore on his left knee a leather kneecap whence hung a moderately large bell
his face which was in the shadow was not distinguishable
however the good man had removed his cap and exclaimed trembling all over at good god
how come you here father madeleine
where did you enter
dieu jesus
did you fall from heaven
there is no trouble about that if ever you do call it will be from there
and what a state you are in
you have no cravat you have not at you have no cost
do you know you would have frightened anyone who did not know you
no cost
lord god
are the saints going mad nowadays
but how did you get in here
his word stumbled over each other
the goodman talked with a rustic vol ibility in which there was nothing alarming
all this was uttered with a mixture of style faction and naive kindliness
who are you
and what house is this
demanded jean valjean
ah
page key this is too much
exclaimed the old man
i am the person for whom you got the place here and this house is the one where you had me placed
what
youdon''t recognize me
no. said jean valjean and how happens if that you know me
you saved my life said the man
he turned
a day of moonlight outlined his profile and jean valjean recognized old gauche le vent
ah
said jean valjean so it is you
yes i recollect you
that is very lucky said the old man in a reproachful time
and what are you doing here
resumed jean valjean
why i am covering my melons of course
in fact at the moment when jean valjean accosted him old gauche l event held in his hand the end of a straw hat which he was occupied in spreading over the melon bed
during the hour or thereabouts that he had been in the garden he had already spread out a number of them
it was this operation which had caused him to execute the peculiar movements observed from the shed by jean valjean
he continued i said to myself' the moon is bright it is going to freeze
what if i were to put my melons into their great coats
' and he added looking at jean valjean with a broad smile per bleu
you ought to have done the same
but how do you come here
jean valjean finding himself known to this man at least only under the name of madeleine thenceforth advanced only with caution
he multiplied his questions
strange to say their roles seemed to be reversed
it was he the intruder who interrogated
and what is this tell which you wear on your knee
this replies gauche leventis so that i may be avoided
what
so that you may be avoided
olde aus bel event winked with an indescribable air
at goodness
there are only women in this house many young girls
it appears that i should be a dangerous person to meet
the bell gives them warning
when i come they go
what house is this
come you know well enough
but i do not
not when you got me the place here as gardener
answer me as though i knew nothing
well then this is the petit pic pic convent
memories recurred to jean valjean
chance that is to say providence had cast him into precisely that convent in the quartier saint antoine where old gauche le vent crippled by the fall from his cart had been admitted on his recommendation two years previously
he repeated as though talking to himself the petit pic pic convent
exactly returned old gauche le vent
but to come to the point how the deuce did you manage to get in here you gather madeleine
no matter if you are a saint you are a man as well and no man enters here
you certainly are here
there is no one but me
still said jean valjean i must stay here
ah good god
cried faux tel event
jean valjean drew near to the old man and said to him in a grave voice father rauch eleven to saved your life
i was the first to recall it returned gauche le vent
well you can do today for me that which i did for you in the olden days
gauche l event took in his aged trembling and wrinkled hands jean valjean's two robust hands and stood for several minutes as though incapable of speaking
at length he exclaimed oh
that would be a blessing from the good god if i could make you some little return for that
save your life
monsieur lemaire dispose of the old man
a wonderful not had transfigured this old man
his countenance seemed to emit a day of light
what do you wish me to do
he resumed
that i will explain to you
you have a chamber
i have an isolated novel yonder behind the ruins of the old convent in a corner which no one ever looks into
there are three rooms in it
the hut was in fact so well hidden behind the ruins and so cleverly arranged to prevent it being seen that jean valjean had not perceived it
good said jean valjean
now i am going to ask two things if you
what are they mr
mayor
in the first place you are not to tell anyone what you know about me
in the second you are not to try to find out anything more
as you please
i know that you can do nothing that is not honest that you have always been a man after the good god's heart
and then moreover you it was who placed me here
that concerns you
i am at your service
that is settled then
now come with me
we will go and get the child
ah
said gauche le vent so there is a child
he added not a word further and followed jean valjean as a dog follows his master
less than half an hour afterwards cosette who had grown rosy again before the flame of a good fire was lying asleep in the old gardener's bed
jean valjean had put on his cravat and cost once more his hat which he had found over the wall had been found and picked up
while jean valjean was putting on his coat gauche le vent had removed the bell and knee cap which now hung on an all besides vintage basket that adorned the wall
the two men were warming themselves with their elbows resting on a table upon which rauch eleventh ad placed a bit of cheese black bread a bottle of wine and two glasses and the old man was saying to jean valjean as he laid his hand on the latter's knee am
father madeleine
you did not recognize me immediately you save people's lives and then you forget them
that is bad
but they remember you
you are among rate
chapters which explains how javert got on the scent the events of which we have just be held the reverse side so to speak had come about in the simplest possible manner
when jean valjean on the evening of the very day when javert had arrested him beside can find's deathbed had escaped from the town hall of m
shrm
the police had supposed that he had be taken himself to paris
paris is a maelstrom where everything is lost and everything disappears in this belly of the world as in the belly of the sea
no forest hides a man as does that crowd
fugitives of every sort know this
they go to paris as to an abyss there are rules which save
the police know it also and it is in paris that they seek what they have lost elsewhere
they sought the ex mayor of m
shrm
javert was summoned to paris to throw light on the ietf searches
javert had in fact rendered powerful assistance in the recapture of jean valjean
javert's zealand intelligence on that occasion had been remarked by m
chan phil let secretary of the prefecture under comte angles
m
dhabi killer who had moreover already been javert's patron had the inspector of m
shrm
attached to the police force of paris
there is very gendered himself useful in divers and though the word may seem strange for such services honorable manners
he no longer thought of jean valjean the wolf of today causes these dogs who are always on the chase to forget the wolf of yesterday when in december here as a newspaper he who never read newspapers but i avert a monarchical man had a desire to know the particulars of the triumphal entry of the prince generalissimo into bayonne
just as he was finishing the article which interested him a name the name of jean valjean attracted his attention at the bottom of a page
the paper announced that the convict jean valjean was dead and published the fact in such formal terms that is very did not doubt it
he confined himself to the remark that's a good entry
then he threw aside the paper and thought no more about it
some time afterwards it chanced that a police report was transmitted from the prefecture of these ones to use to the prefecture of police in paris concerning the abduction of a child which had taken place under peculiar circumstances as it was said in the commune of mont vermeil
a little girl of seven or eight years of age the report said who had been in trusted by her mother to an inn keeper of that neighborhood had been stolen by a stranger this child answered to the name of cosette and was the daughter of a girl named f anyone who had died in the hospital it was not known where or when
this report came under have rt's eye and set him to thinking
the name it can times as well known to him
he remembered that jean valjean had made him javert burst into laughter by asking him for a respite of three days for the purpose of going to fetch that creature's child
he recalled the fact that jean valjean had been arrested in paris at the very moment when he was stepping into the coach for mont vermeil
some signs had made him suspect at the time that this was the second occasion of his entering that coach and that he had already on the previous day made an excursion to the neighborhood of that village for he had not been seen in the village itself
what had he been intending to do in that region of montrer help
it could not even be surmised
javert understood it now
bantine's daughter was there
jean valjean was going there in search other
and now this child had been stolen by a stranger
who could that stranger be
could it be jean valjean
but jean valjean was dead
javert without saying anything to anybody took the coach from the pewter platter cul de sac de la plans metre and made a trip to mont vermeil
he expected to find a great deal of light on the subject there he found a great deal of obscurity
for the first few days the then add legs had shattered in their rage
the disappearance of the park has created a sensation in the village
he immediately obtained numerous versions of the story which ended in the abduction of a child
hence the police report
but their first vexation having passed off the barrier with his wonderful instinct had very quickly comprehend fd that it is never advisable to stir up the prosecutor of the crown and that his complaints with regard to the abduction of cosette would have as their first result to fix upon himself and upon many dark affairs which he had on hand the glittering eye of justice
the last thing that owl's desire is to have a candle brought to them
and in the first place now explain the fifteen hundred francs which he had received
he turned squarely round put a gag on his wife's mouth and feigned astonishment when the stolen child was jen too had to him
he understood nothing about it no doubt he had grumbled for a while at having that dear little creature taken from him so hastily he should have liked to keep her two or three days longer out of tenderness but her grandfather had come for her in the most natural way in the world
he added the grandfather which produced a good effect
this was the story that is very hit upon when he arrived at mint vermeil
the grandfather caused jean valjean to vanish
nevertheless javert dropped a few questions like plummets into the barrier's history
who was that grandfather
and what was his name
the barrier replied with simplicity he is a wealthy farmer
i saw his passport
i think his name wash
guillaume lambert
lambert is a respect able and extremely reassuring name
thereupon javert returned to paris
jean valjean is certainly dead said he and i am an in ny
he had again begun to forget this history when in the course of march be heard of a singular personage who dwelt in the parish of sq. in the card and who had been cut named the mendicant who gives alms
this person the story ran was a man of means whose name no one knew exactly and who lived alone with a little girl of eight years who knew nothing about herself save that she had come from mont vermeil
mont vermeil
that name was always coming up and it made javert prick up his ears
an old beggar police spy an ex cradle to whom this person had given aims added a few more details
this gentleman of property was very shy never coming out except in the evening speaking to no one except occasionally to the poor and never allowing anyone to approach him
he wore a horrible old yellow frock coat which was worth many millions being a low added with bank bills
this piqued javert's curiosity in a decided manner
in order to get a close look at this fantastic gentleman without alarming him he borrowed the beadle's outfit for a day and the place where the old spy was in the habit of crouching every evening whining prisons through his nose and playing the spy undercover of prayer
the suspected individual did indeed approach is very this disguised and best psalms on him
at that moment is very raised his head and the shock which jean valjean received on recognizing javert was equal to the one received buy a very when he thought he recognized jean valjean
however the darkness might have misled him jean valjean's death was official javert cherished very grave doubts and when in doubt javert the man of scruples never laid a finger on anyone's collar
he followed his many other or beau house and got the old woman to talking which was no difficult matter
the old woman confirmed the fact regarding the cost lined with millions and narrated to him the episode of the thousand franc bill
she had seen it
she had handled it
javert hired a room that evening be installed himself in it
he came and listened at the mysterious lodger's door hoping to catch the sound of his voice but jean valjean saw his candle through the keyhole and foiled the spy by keeping silent
on the following day jean valjean decamped but the noise made by the fall of the five franc piece was noticed by the old woman who hearing the rattling of coin suspected that he might be intending to leave and made haste to warn have ft
at night when jean valjean came out javert was waiting for him behind the trees of the boulevard with two men
javert had demanded assistance at the prefecture but he had not mentioned the name of the individual whom he hoped to seize that was his secret and he had kept it for three reasons in the first place because the slightest indiscretion might put jean valjean on the alert next because to lay hands on an ex convict who had made his escape and was reputed dead on a criminal whom justice had formerly classes forever as among male factors of the most dangerous sort was a magnificent success which the old members of the parisian police would assuredly not leave to a newcomer like javert and he was afraid of being deprived of his convict and lastly because i avery being an artist had a taste for the unforeseen
he hated those we'll be raised successes which are talked of long in advance and have had the bloom brushed off
he preferred to elaborate his masterpieces on the dark and to unveil then suddenly at the last
javert had followed jean valjean from tree to tree then from corner to corner of the street and had not lost sight of him for a single instant even at the moments when jean valjean believed himself to be the most secure javert's eye had been on him
why had not javert arrested jean valjean
because he was still in doubt
it must be remembered that at that epoch the police was not precisely at its ease the free press embarrassed it several arbitrary arrests denounced by the newspapers had echoed even as far as the chambers and had rendered the prefecture timid
interference with individual liberty was a grave matter
the police agents were afraid of making a mistake the prefect laid the blame on them a mistake meant dismissal
the reader can imagine the effect which this brief paragraph reproduced by twenty newspapers would have caused in paris yesterday an aged grandfather with white maura respectable and well to do gentleman who was walking with his grand child aged right was arrested and conducted to the agency of the prefecture as an escaped convict
let us repeat in addition that is very had scruples of his own injunctions of his conscience were added to the injunctions of the prefect
he was really in doubt
jean valjean turned his back on him and walked in the dark
sadness uneasiness anxiety depression this fresh misfortune of being forced to flee by night to seek a chance refuge in paris for cosette and times of the necessity of regulating his pace to the pace of the child all this without his being aware of it had altered jean valjean's walk and impressed on his bearing such senility that the police themselves incarnate in the person or have et might and did in fact make a mistake
the impossibility of approaching too close his costume of an emigre preceptor the declaration of the barrier which made a grandfather of him and finally the belief in his death in prison added still further to the uncertainty which gathered thick in javert's mind
for an instant it occurred to him to make an abrupt demand for his papers but if the man was not jean valjean and if this man was not a good honest old fellow living on his income he was probably some merry blade deeply and cunningly implicated in the obscure web of parisian misdeeds some chief of a dangerous band who have aims to conceal his other talents which was an old dodge
he had trusty fellows accomplices' retreats in case of emergencies in which he would now lung take refuge
all these turns which he was making through the streets seemed to indicate that he was not a simple and honest man
to arrest him too hastily would be to kill the men that laid the golden eggs
where was the inconvenience in waiting
javert was very sure that he would not escape
thus he proceeded in a tolerably perplexed state of mind putting to himself a hundred questions about this enigmatic so personage
it was only quite late in the rue de pontoise that thanks to the brilliant light thrown from a dram shop be decidedly recognized jean valjean
there are in this world two beings who give a profound start the mother who recovers her child and the tiger whore covers his prey
javert have that profound start
as soon as he had positively recognized jean valjean the formidable convict he perceived that there were only three of them and he asked for reinforcements at the police station of the rue de pontoise
one puts on gloves before grasping at born cudgel
this delay and the halt at the carrefour roll into consult with his agents came near causing him to lose the trail
he speedily divined however that jean valjean would want to put the river between his pursuers and himself
he bent his head and reflected like a bloodhound who puts his nose to the ground to make sure that he is on the rights cent
javert with his powerful rectitude of instinct went straight to the bridge of austerlitz
a word with the toll keeper furnished him with the information which he required have you seen a man with a little girl
i made him pay two sous replied the toll keeper
javert reached the bridge in season to see jean valjean traverse the small illuminated spot on the other side of the water leading cosette by the hand
he saw him enter the rue du chem invert saint antoine he remembered the cul de sac gene or arranged there like a trap and of the sole exit of the rue de kit mug into the rue petit pick us
he made sure of his back burrows as huntsmen say he hastily despatched one of his agents by a roundabout way to guard that issue
a patrol which was returning to the arsenal post having passed him he made a requisition on it and caused it to accompany him
in such games soldiers are aces
moreover the principle is that in order to get the best of a wild boar one must employ the science off emery and plenty of dogs
these combinations having been effected feeling that jean valjean was caught between the blind alley gene it on the right his agent on the left and himself javert in the rear he took a pinch of snuff
then he began the game
he experienced one ecstatic and internal moment he allowed his man to go on ahead knowing that he had him safe but desirous of postponing the moment of a great as long as possible happy at the thought that he was taken and yet at seeing him free gloating over him with his gaze with that voluptuousness of the spider which allows the fly to flutter and of the car which lets the mouse run
class and talons possess a monstrous sensuality the obscure movements of the creature imprisoned in their pincers
what a delight this strangling is
javert was enjoying himself
the meshes of his gst were stoutly knotted
he was sure of success all he had to do now was to close his hand
accompanied as he was the very idea of resistance was impossible however rigorous energetic and desperate jean valjean might be
illustration javert on the hunt by avert on the hunt javert advanced slowly sounding searching on his way all the books of the street like so many pockets of thieves
when he reached the centre of the web he found the fly no longer there
his exasperation can be imagined
he interrogated his sentinel of the guess root mud and petit pico us that agent who had remained in perturbs boys this post has not seen the man pass
it sometimes happens that a star is lost head and horns that is to say he escapes although he has the park on his very heels and then the oldest huntsmen know not what to say
duvivier livni ville and desprez half short
in a discomfiture of this sort art on he exclaims it was not a stag but a sorcerer
javert would have liked to utter the same cry
his disappointment bordered for a moment in despair and tage
it is certain that napoleon made mistakes during the war with russia that alexander committed blunders in the war in india that caesar made mistakes in the war in africa that cyrus was at fault in the war in scythia and that is very foundered on this campaign against jean valjean
he was wrong perhaps in hesitating in his recognition of the ex convict
the first glance should have sufficed him
he was wrong in not arresting him purely and simply in the old building he was wrong in not arresting him when he positively recognized him in the rue de pontoise
he was wrong in taking counsel with his auxiliaries in the full light of the moon in the carrefour rollin
advice is certainly useful it is a good thing to know and to interrogate those of the dogs who deserve confidence but the hunter can not be too cautious when he is chasing uneasy animals like the wolf and the convict
javert by taking too much thought as to how he should set the bloodhounds of the pack on the trail alarmed the beach by giving him wind of the dart and so made him run
above all he was wrong in rhag after he had picked up the scent again on the bridge of austerlitz he played that formidable and puerile game of keeping such a man at the end of a thread
he thought himself stronger than he was and believed that he could play at the game of the mouse and the lion
at the same time he reckoned himself as too weak when he judged it necessary to obtain reinforcement
fatal precaution waste of precious time
javert committed all these blunders and nonetheless was one of the cleverest and most correct spies that ever existed
he was in the full force of the term what is called in de nerja knowing dog
but what is there that is perfect
great strategists have their eclipses
the greatest follies are often composed like the largest roles of a multitude of strands
take the cable thread by thread take all the petty determining motives separately and you can break them one after the other and you say that is all there is of it
braid them twist them together the result is enormous it is attila hesitating between mardi an on the east and valentinian on the west it is hannibal harry ing at capua it is canton falling asleep at a reissue aube
however that maybe even at the moment when he saw that jean valjean had escaped him javert did not lose his head
sure that the convict who had broken his ban could not be tariff he established sentinel she organized traps and angus cases and beat the quarter all that night
the first thing he saw was the disorder in the street lantern whose role has been cut
a precious sign which however led him a stray since it caused him to turn all his researches in the direction of the cul de each end of
in this blind alley there were tolerably low walls which abutted on gardens whose bounds as joined the immense stretches of wasteland
jean valjean evidently must have fled in that direction
the fact is that had he penetrated a little further in the cul de sac gen to the would probably have done so and have been lost
javert explored these gardens and these waste stretch eq as though he had been hunting for a needle
at daybreak he left two intelligent men on the outlook and returned to the prefecture of police as much ashamed as a police spy who had been captured by a robber might have been
book sixth
le petit pic pic chapter i number rue petit pico is nothing half a century ago more resembled every other carriage rate than the carriage rate of number rue petit pic pic
this entrance which usually stood a jar in the most inviting fashion permitted a view of two things neither of which have anything very funereal about them a courtyard surrounded by walls hung with vines and the face of a lounging porter
above the wall at the bottom of the court tall trees were visible
when a day of sunlight enlivened the courtyard when a glass of wine cheered up the porter it was difficult to pass number little pic pussy feet without carrying away a smiling in pression of it
nevertheless it was a sombre place of which one had had a glimpse
the threshold smiled the house prayed and wept
if one succeeded in passing the porter which was not easy which was even nearly impossible for everyone for there was an open sesame
which it was necessary to know if the porter once passed one entered a little vestibule on the right on which opened a staircase shut in between two walls and so narrow that only one person could ascend it at a time if one did not allow one's self to be alarmed by a day bing of canary yellow with a dado of chocolate which clothed this staircase if one ventured to ascend it one crossed a first landing then a second and arrived on the first story at a corridor where the yellow wash and the chocolate hued point h pursue done with a peaceable persistency
staircase and corridor were lighted by two beautiful windows
the corridor took a turn and became dark
if one doubled this cape one arrived a few paces further on in front of a door which was all the more mysterious because it was not fastened
if one opened phone found one's self in a little chamber about six feet square filed well scrubbed clean cold and hung with nankin paper with green flowers at fifteen cpus the roll
a white full light fell from a large window with tiny pages on the left which usurped the whole width of the room
one based about but saw no one one listened one heard neither a footstep not a human murmur
the walls were bare the chamber was not furnished there was not even a chair
one looked again and be held on the wall facing the doors quadrangular hole about a foot square with a grating of interlacing iron bars black knotted solid which formed squares i had almost said meshes of less than an inch and a half in diagonal length
the little green flowers of the bank in paper ran in a calm and orderly manner to those iron bars without being startled or thrown into confusion by their funereal contact
supposing that a living being had been so wonderfully thin as to essay an entrance of an exit through the square hole this grating would have prevented it
it did not allow the passage of the body but it did allow the passage of the eyes that is to say of the mind
this seems to have occurred to them for it had been re enforced by a sheet of tin inserted in the wall a little in the rear and pierced with a thousand holes more microscopic than the holes of a strainer
at the bottom of this plate an aperture had been pierced exactly similar to the orifice of a letterbox
a bit of tape attached to a bellaire hung at the right of the trated opening
if the tape was pulled a bell rang and one heard a voice very near at hand which made one start
who is there
the voice remanded
it was a woman's voice a gentle voice so gentle that it was mournful
here again there was a magical word which it was necessary to know
if one did not know if the voice ceased the wall became silent once more as though the terrified obscurity of the sepulchre had been on the other side of it
if one knew the password the voice resume center on the right
one then perceived on the right facing the windows glass door surmounted by a frame glazed and painted gray
on raising the latch and crossing the threshold one experienced precisely the same impression as when one enters at the theatre into a grated baignoire before the grating is lowered and the chandelier is lighted
one was intact in a sort of theatre box narrow furnished with two old chairs and a much frayed straw matting spa rely illuminated by the vague light from the glass doors regular box with its front just of a height to lean upon hearing a tablet of blackwood
this box was grated only the grating of it was not of gilded wood as at the opera it was a monstrous lattice of iron bars hideously interlaced and riveted to the wall by enormous fastenings which resembled clenched fists
the first minutes passed when one's eyes began to grow used to this cellar like half twilight one tried to pass the grating but got no further than six inches beyond it
there he encountered a barrier of black shutter are enforced and fortified with transverse beams of wood painted a gingerbread yellow
these shutters were divided into long narrow slats and they masked the entire length of the grating
they were always closed
at the expiration of a few moments one heard a voice proceeding from behind these shutters and saying i am here
what do you wish with me
it was a beloved sometimes an adored voice
hi one was visible
hardly the sound of a breath was audible
it seemed as though it were a spirit which had been evoked that was speaking to you across the walls of the tomb
if one chanced to be within certain prescribed and very rare conditions the coat of one of the shutters opened opposite you the evoked spirit became an apparition
behind the grating behind the shutter one perceived so far as the grating permitted sight ahead of which only the mouth and the chin were visible the rest was covered with a black veil
one caught a glimpse of a black gui mps and a form that was barely defined covered with a black shroud
that head spoke with you but did not look at you and never smiled at you
the light which came from behind you was adjusted in such a manner that you saw her in the white and she saw you in the black
this light was symbolical
nevertheless your eyes plunged eagerly through that opening which was made in that place shut off from all glances
a profound vague news envelopes that form clad in mourning
your eyes searched that vagueness and sought to make out the surroundings of the apparition
at the expiration of a very short time you discovered that you could see nothing
what you be held was night emptiness shadows a wintry most mingled with a vapor from the tomb a sort of terrible peace a silence from which you could gather nothing not even signs a gloom in which you could distinguish nothing not even phantoms
what you be held was the interior of a cloister
it was the interior of that severe and gloomy edifice which was called the convent of the bernard knew of the perpetual adoration
the box in which you stood was the parlor
the first voice which had addressed you was that of the port read who always sat motionless and silent on the other side of the wall near the square opening screened by the iron grating and the plate with its thousand holes as by a double visor
the obscurity which bathed the grated box arose from the fact that the parlor which had a window on the side of the world had gone on the side of the convent
profane eyes must see nothing of that sacred place
nevertheless there was something beyond that shadow there was a light there was life in the midst of that death
although this was the most strictly walled of all convents we shall endeavor to make our way into it and to take the reader in and to say without transgressing the proper bounds things which storytellers have never seen and have therefore never described
chapter ii the obedience of martin verga this convent which in had already existed for many along year in the tue petit pick us was a community offer jardines of the obedience of martin verna
these bernard ones were attached in consequence not to clairvaux like the bernardine monks but to coteaux like the benedictine monks
in other words they were the subjects not of saint bernard but if saint benoit
anyone who has turned over old folios to any extent knows that martin very abounded in a congregation of bernardine's benedictines with salamanca for the head of the order and alcala as the branch establishment
this congregation had sent out branches throughout all the catholic countries of europe
there is nothing unusual in the latin church in the web rafts of one order on another
to mention only a single order of saint benoit which is here in question there are attached to this order without counting the obedience of martin very about congregations two in italy mont casein and sainte just one of padua two in france count and saint hair and june orders call on bros. and an mont the celestine the canal files the carthusian's the humilis's the oliva tries the silvestri ns and lastly coteaux for coteaux itself a trunk for other orders is only an offshoot of saint benoit
coteaux dates from saint robert anne de miles me in the diocese of lang resin
now it was in that the devil having retired to the desert of subiaco he was old had he turned hermit
was chased from the ancient temple of apollo where he dwelt by saint benoit then aged seventeen
after the rule of the carmelites who go barefoot wear a bit of willow on their throats and never sit down the harshest rule is that of the bernardine c benedictines of martin verna
they are clothed in black with a gui mpe which in accordance with the express command of saint benoit mounts to the chin
adobe observe with large sleeves a large woollen well they him of which mounts to the chin cut square on the breast the band which descends over their grow to their eyes this is their dress
all is black except the band which is white
the novice as far the same habit but all in white
the professed nuns also wear a rosary at their side
the bernardine's benedictines of martin verga practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictines called ladies of the holy sacrament who at the beginning of this century had two houses in paris one at the temple the other in the rue neuve sainte genevieve
however the bernardine's benedictines of the petit pic pic of whom we are speaking were a totally different order from the ladies of the holy sacrament cloistered on the turn five sainte genevieve and at the temple
there were numerous differences in their rule there were some in their costume
the bernardine's benedictines of the petit pic piss off the black gui mps and the benedictines of the holy sacrament and of the rue neuve sainte genevieve wore a white one and had besides on their breasts a holy sacrament about three inches long in silver gilt or gilded copper
the nuns of the petit pic pts did not wear this holy sacrament
the perpetual adoration which was common to the house of the petit pic pic and to the house of the temple leaves those two orders perfectly distinct
their only resemblance lies in this practice of the ladies of the holy sacrament and the bernardine's of martin verga just as there existed a similarity in the study and the glorification of all the mysteries relating to the infancy the life and death of jesus christ and the virgin between the two orders which were nevertheless widely separated and on occasion even hostile
the oratory of italy established at florence by philip de nero and the oratory of france established by pierre de be tuple
the oratory of france claimed the precedence since philips ever i was only a saint while be sulle was a cardinal
let us return to the harsh spanish rule of martin verna
the bernardine's benedictines of this one dish cefact all the year round abstain from meat fast in lent and on many other ways which are peculiar to them rise from their first sleep from one to threeo'clock in the morning to read their breviary and chant matins sleep in all seasons between serve sheets and on straw make no use of the bath never light a fire scourge themselves every friday observe the rule of silence speak to each other only during the recreation hours which are very brief and wear drug get chemises for six months in the year from september th which is the exaltation of the holy cross until easter
these six months are a modification the rule says all the year but this drug get chemise intolerable in the heat of summer produced fevers and nervous spasms
the use of it had to be restricted
even with this palliation when the nuns put on this chemise ont meth of september they suffer from fever for three or four days
obedience poverty chastity perseverance in their seclusion these are their vows which the rule greatly aggravates
the prior desk selected for three years by the mothers who are called here's vocals's because they have a voice in the chapter
a prioress can only be reflected twice which fixes the longest possible reign of a prioress at nine years
they never see the officiating priest who is always hidden from them by a serge curtain nine feet in height
during the sermon when the preacher is in the chapel they drop their veils over their faces
they must always speak low walk with their eyes on the ground and theory add showed
one man only is allowed to enter the convent the archbishop of the diocese
there is really on either the gardener
but he is always an old man and in order that he may always be alone in the garden and that the nuns may be warned to avoid him a nellie attaches to his knee
their submission to the prioress is absolute and passive
it is the canonical subjection in the full force of its abnegation
as at the voice of christ it cock christi at a gesture at the first sinbad but i had primum signum immediately with cheerfulness with perseverance with a certain blind obedience promote mil writer per se ve ranger etc. as cash adam obedient i was the file in the hand of the workman quasi pima min man in us fabri without power to read or to write without express permission of ge devel scrivere non add laver it wine express a superior is lucent ia
each one of them in turn makes what they call reparation
the reparation is the prayer for all the sims for all the faults for all the dissensions for all the violations for all the iniquities for all the crimes committed on earth
for the space of twelve consecutive hours from fouro'clock in the afternoon till fouro'clock in the morning or from fouro'clock in the morning until fouro'clock in the afternoon the sister who is making reparation remains on her knees on the stone before the holy sacrament with hands clasped a rope around her neck
when her fatigue becomes unendurable she prostrated herself flat on her face against the earth with her arms outstretched in the form of across this is her only relief
in this attitude she prays for all the guilty in the universe
this is great to sublimity
as this act is performed in front of a post on which burns a candle it is called without distinction to make reparation or to beat the post
the nuns even prefer out of humility this last expression which contains an idea of torture and a basement
to make reparation is a function in which the whole soul is absorbed
the sister at the post would not turn round were a thunderbolt to fall directly behind her
besides this there is always a sister kneeling before the holy sacrament
this station lasts an hour
they relieve each other like soldiers on guard
this is the perpetual adoration
the prior essex and the mother's almost always bear names stamped with peculiar solemnity recalling not the saints and martyrs but moments in the life of jesus christ as mother nativity mother conception mother presentation mother passion
but the names of saints are not interdicted
when one sees them one never sees anything but their mouths
all their teeth are yellow
no toothbrush ever entered that convent
brushing one's teeth is at the top of a ladder at whose bottom is the loss of one's soul
they never say my
they possess nothing of their own and they must not attach themselves to anything
they call everything our thus our veil our chaplet if they were speak in for their chemise they would say our chemise
sometimes they grow attached to some petty object to a book of hours are lisa medal that has been blessed
as soon as they become aware that they are growing attached to this object they must give it up
they recall the words of saint therese to whom a great lady said as she was on the point of eg urging her order permit me mother to send for a bible to which i am greatly attached
ah you are attached to something
in that case do not enter our order
every person whatever is forbidden to shut herself up to have a place of her own a chamber
they live with their cells open
when they meet one says blessed and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
the other responds forever
the same ceremony when one tale at the other's door
hardly has she touched the door when a soft voice on the other side is heard today hastily forster
like all practices this becomes mechanical by force of habit and i be sometimes days for ever before the other has had time to say the rather long sentence praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
among the visit am dinesh be one who enters says ave maria and the one whose cell is entered says gratis plena
it is their way of saying good day which is in fact full of grace
at each hour of the day three supplementary strokes sound from the church bell of the convent
at this signal prioress vocal mother's professed jun slag sisters novices post uk ants interrupt what they are saying what they are doing it what they are thinking and all day in unison if it is fiveo'clock for instance at fiveo'clock and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altar
if it is eighto'clock at eighto'clock and at all hours
and soon according to the hour
this custom the object of which is to break the thread of thought and to lead it back constantly to god exists in many communities the formula alone varies
thus at the infant jesus they say at this hour and at every hour may the love of jesus kind of my heart
the bernardine's benedictines of martin varga cloistered fifty years ago at petit lisp us chant the offices to a solemn is almost a pure gregorian chant and always with full voice during the whole course of the office
everywhere in the missal where an asterisk occurs they pause and say in a low voice jesus marie joseph
for the office of the dead they adopt a tone so low that the voices of women can hardly descend to such a depth
the effect produced is che il inf and tragic
the nuns of the petit pic pic had made a vault under their grand altar for the burial of their community
the government as they say does not permit this vault to receive coffins so they leave the content when they die
this is an affliction to them and causes them consternation as an infraction of the rules
they had obtained a mediocre consolation at best permission to be interred at a special hour and in a special corner in the ancient vsu girard cemetery which was made of land which had formerly belonged to their community
on fridays the nuns hear high mass vespers and all the office was on sunday
they scrupulously observe in addition all the little festivals unknown to people of the world of which the church of france was so prodigal in the olden days and of which it is still prodigal in spain and italy
their stations in the chapel are interminable
as for the number and duration of their prayers we can convey no better idea of them than by quoting the ingenious remark of one of them the prayers of the post uk ants are frightful the prayers of the novices are still worse and the prayers of the professed nuns are still worse
once a week the chapter assembles the prioress presides the vocal mothers assist
each sister kneels in turn on the stones and confesses aloud in the presence of all the faults and sins which she has committed during the week
the vocal mothers consult after each confession and inflict the penance aloud
besides this confession in a loud tone for which all faults in the least serious are reserved they have for their denial offences what they call the couple
to make one's couple means to prostrate one's self flat on one's face during the office in front of the prioress until the latter who is never called anything but our mother notifies the culprit by a slight tap of her foot against the food other stall that she can rise
the couple of pesca vi is made for a very small matters broken glass storm veil an involuntary delay of a few seconds at an office a false note in church etc.
this suffices and the soul pw is made
the co hope is entirely spontaneous it is the culpable person herself the word is etymological it in its place here who judges herself and inflict sit on herself
on festival days and sundays four mother percent of sin to be the offices before a large reading desk with four places
one day one of the mother or even goes into her a psalm beginning with sc ce and instead of ecce she uttered aloud the three notes do so sol for this piece of absent mindedness she underwent a couple which lasted during the whole service what rendered the fault enormous was the fact that the chapter has laughed
when a gun is summoned to the parlor even edge of the prioress herself she drops her veil as will be remembered so that only her mouth is visible
the prioress alone can hold communication with strangers
the others can see only their immediate family and that very rarely
if by chance an outsider presents herself to see a minor one whom she has known and lived in the outer world a regular series of negotiations is required
if it is a woman the authorization may sometimes be granted then incomes and they talk to her through the shutters which are opened only for another or sister
it is unnecessary to say that permission is always refused to msn
such is the rule of saint benoit aggravated by martin verna
these guns are not gay rosy and fresh as the daughters of other orders often are
they are pale and grave
between and three of them went mad
chapter iii austerities one is a post uk ant for two years at least often for four a novice for four
it is rare that the definitive vows can be pronounced earlier than the age of twenty three or twenty four years
the bernardine's benedictines of martin verga do not admit widows to their order
in their cells they deliver themselves up to many unknown made rations of which they must never speak
in the day when a novice makes her profession she is dressed in her handsome starfire she is crowned with white roses her hair is brushed until it shines and curled
then she prostrated herself a great black veil is thrown over her and the office for the dead is sung
then the nine separate into two files onefile passes close to her saying in plain give accents our sister is dead and the other file responds in a voice of ecstasy our sister is alive in jesus christ
at the epoch when this story takes place a boarding school was attached to the convent a boarding school for young girls of noble and mostly wealthy families among whom could be remarked mademoiselle de saint a upside and cegelis web and an english girl bearing the illustrious catholic name of talbot
these young girl dressed by these guys between four walls grew up with a horror of the world and of the age
one of them said to us one day the sight of the street pavement made me shudder from head to foot
they were dressed in blue with a white cap and a holy spirit of silver gilt or of copper on their breast
on certain brand festival days particularly saint martha's day they were permitted as a high favor and a supreme happiness to dress themselves as nuns and to carry out the offices and practice of saint benoit for a whole day
in the early days the nuns were in the habit of lending them their black garments
this seemed profane and the prioress forbade it
only the novices were led mitted to lend
it is remarkable that these performances tolerated and encouraged no doubt in the convent out of a secret spirit of proselytism and in order to give these children a foretaste of the holy habit were a genuine happiness and a real recreation for the scholars
they simply amused themselves within
it was new it gave them a change
fabric reasons of childhood which do not however success in making us world pings comprehend the felicity of holding a holy water sprinkler in one's hand and standing for hours together singing hard enough for four in front of a reading desk
the pupils conformed with the exception of the austerities to all the practices of the convent
there was a certain young woman who entered the world and who after many years of married life had not succeeded in breaking herself of the habit of saying in great haste whenever anyone knocked at her door forever
like the nuns the pupils saw their relatives only in the parlor
their very mothers did not obtain permission to embrace them
the following illustrates to what a degree severity on that point was carried
one day a young girl received a visit from her mother who was accompanied by a little sister three years of age
the young girl wept for she wished greatly to embrace her sister
impossible
she begged that at least the child might be permitted to pass her little hand through the bars so that she could miss it
this was almost indignantly refused
chapter iv gay et les nonetheless these young girls filled this grave house with charming souvenirs
at certain hours childhood sparkled in that cloister
the recreation hours truck
a door swung on its hinges
the birds said good here come the children
ani eruption of youth inundated that garden intersected with across like a shroud
radiant faces white foreheads innocent eyes full of merry light all sorts of auroras were scattered about amid these shadows
after the psalm of its the bells the peaks and i bells and offices the sound of these little girls burst forth on a sudden more sweetly than the noise offers
the hive of joy was opened and each one brought her money
they played they called to each other they formed into groups they ran about pretty little white teeth chartered in the corners the veils superintended the laughs from a distance shades kept watch of the sunbeams but what mattered it
still they beamed and laughed
those four lugubrious walls had their moment of dazzling brilliancy
they looked on vaguely blanched with the reflection of so much joy at this sweets warming of the hives
it was like a shower of roses falling athwart this house of mourning
the young girls fri licked beneath the eyes of the bums the hazel dumped c ability does not embarrass innocence
thanks to these children there was among so many austere hours one hour of ingenious news
the little ones skilled about the elder ones danced
in this cloister play was mingled with heaven
nothing is so delightful and so augusta's all these fresh expanding young souls
homer would have come thither to laugh with perrault and there was in that black garden youth health noise cries giddiness pleasure happiness enough to smooth out the wrinkles of all their ance stresses those of the epic as well as those of the fairy tale those of the throne as well as those of the thatched cottage from hecuba to lamers grand
in that house more than anywhere else perhaps arise those children's sayings which are so graceful and which evoke a smile that is full of thoughtfulness
it was between those four gloomy walls that a child of five years exclaimed one day mother
one of the big girls has just told me that i have only nine years and ten months longer to remain here
what happiness
it was here too that this memorable dialogue took place a vocal mother
why are you weeping my child
the child aged six
i told alia that i knew my french history
she says that i do not know it but i do
alix the big girl aged nine
no she does not know it
the mother
how is that my child
alix
she told me to open the book at random and to ask her any question in the book and she would answer it
well
she did not answer it
let us see about it
what did you ask her
i opened the book at random as she proposed and i put the first question that i came across
and what was the question
it was' what happened after that
' it was there that that profound remark was made agents rather greedy paris yet which belonged to a lady boarder how well bred
it eats the top of the slice of bread and butter just like a person
it was in one of the flagstones of this cloister that there was once picked up a confession which has been written out in advance in order that she might not forget it by a winner of seven years father i accuse myself of having been avaricious
father i accuse myself of having been an adulteress
father i accuse myself of having raised my eyes to the gentlemen
it was on one of the turf benches of this garden that a rosy mouth six years of age improvised the follo wing tale which was listened to by blue eyes aged four and five years there were three little cocks who owned a country where there were a great many flowers
they plucked the flowers and put them in their pockets
after that they plucked the leaves and put them in their playthings
there was a wolf in that country there was a great deal of forest and the wolf was in the forest and he ate the little cocks
and this other poem there came aglow with a stick
it was punch in ello who bestowed it on the cat
it was not good for her it hurt her
then a lady put punch in ello in prison
it was there that a little abandoned child at kindling whom the convent was bringing up out of charity uttered this sweet and heartbreaking saying
she heard the others talking of their mothers and she murmured in her corner as for me my mother was not there when i was born
there was a stourport read who could always be seen hurrying through the corridors with her bunch of keys and whose name was sister agatha
the big big girls those over ten years of age called her at a thick as
the refectory a large apartment of an oblong square form which received no light except through a vaulted cloister on a level with the garden was dark and damp and as the children say full of feasts
all the place around about furnished their contingent of insects
each of its four corners has received in the language of the pupils a special and expressive name
there was spider corner caterpillar corner wood louse corner and cricket corner
cricket corner was near the kitchen and was highly esteemed
it was not so cold there as elsewhere
from the refectory the names had passed to the boarding school and there served as in the old college mazarin to distinguish four nations
every pupil belonged to one of these four nations according to the corner of the refectory in which she sat at meals
one day monseigneur the archbishop while making his pastoral visit saw a pretty little rosy girl with beautiful golden hair enter the classroom through which he was passing
he inquired of another pupils charming brunette with rosy cheeks who stood near him who is that
she is a spider monseigneur
bah
and that one yonder
she is a cricket
and that one
she is a caterpillar
really
and yourself
i am a wood li use monseigneur
every house of this sort has its own peculiarities
at the beginning of this century e. cohen was one of those strict and graceful places where young girls pass their childhood in a shadow that is almost august
are cohen in order to take rank in the procession of the holy sacrament a distinction was made between virgins and florists
there were also the dais and the censors the first shots of the cords of the dais and the others who carried incense before the holy sacrament
the flowers belonged by right to the florists
four virgins walked in advance
on the morning of that great day it was no rare thing to hear the question put in the dormitory who is a virgin
madame campag used to quote this saying or a little one of seven years to a big girl of sixteen who took the head of the procession while she the little one remained at the rear you are a virgin but i am not
chapter bdicty actions above the door of the refectory this prayer which was called the white paternoster and which possessed the property of hearing people straight to paradise was inscribed in large black letters little white paternoster which god made which god said which god placed in paradise
in the evening when i went to bed i found three angels sitting on my be done at the foot two at the head the good virgin mary in the middle who told me to lie down without hesitation
the good god is my father the good virginia my mother the three apostles are my brothers the three virgins are my sisters

'' you have not seen the good now where is he
'' he is in the tree of the cross his feet hanging his hands nailed a little cap of white thorns on his head
' whoever shall say this thrice at eventide thrive in the morning shall win paradise at the last
in this characteristic it is it had disappeared from the wall under a triple coating of day bing paint
at the present time it is finally disappearing from the memories of several who were young girls then and who are old women now
a large crucifix fastened to the wall completed the decoration of this refectory whose only door as we think we have mentioned opened on the garden
two narrow tables each flanked by two wooden benches formed two long parallel lines from one end to the other of the refectory
the walls were white the tables were black these two mourning colors constitute the only variety in convents
the meals were plain and the good of the children themselves severe
a single dish of meat and vegetables combined or salt fish such was their luxury
this meagre card which was reserved for the pupils alone was nevertheless an exception
the children are in silence under the eye of the mother whose turn it was while a fly took a motion to fly or to him against the rule opened and shut a wooden book from time to time
this silence was seasoned with the lives of the saints read aloud from a little pulpit with a desk which was situated at the foot of the crucifix
the reader was one of the big girls in weekly turn
at regular distances on the bare tables there were large varnishes bowls in which the pupils washed their own silver cups and knives and forms and into which they sometimes threesome scrap of tough meat or spoiled rich this was punished
these goals were called fondsd' eau
the child who broke the silence made across with her tongue
where
on the ground
she licked the pavement
the dust that end of all joys was charged with the chastisement of those poor little rose leaves which had been guilty of chirping
there was in the convent a book which has never been printed except as a unique copy and which it is forbidden to read
it is the rule of saint benoit
an arcanum which no profane eye must penetrate
be more bypass eu constitu gloves nostra western is communica bih
the pupils one day succeeded in getting possession of this book and set to reading it with avidity a reading which was often interrupted by the fear of being caught which caused them to close the volume precipitate ly
from the great danger this incurred they derived but a very moderate amount of pleasure
the most interesting thing they found were some unintelligible pages about the sins of young boys
they played in an alley of the garden bordered with a few shabby fruit trees
in spite of the extreme surveillance and the severity of the punishments administered when the wind had shaken the trees they sometimes succeeded in picking up a green apple or a spoiled apricot or an inhabited pear on the sky
i will now cede the privilege of speech to a letter which lies before me a letter written five and twenty years ago by a bold pupil now madame la duchesse de one of the most elegant women in paris
i quote literally one hides one's pear or one's apple as best one may
when one goes upstairs to put the veil on the bed before supper one stuffs them under one's pillow and at night one eats them in bed and when one can not do that one eats them in the closet
that was one of their greatest luxuries
once it was at the epoch of the visit from the archbishop to the convent one of the young girls mademoiselle bouchard who was connected with the montmorency family laid a wager that she would ask for a day's leave of absence an enormity india us here a community
the water was accepted but not one of those who get believed that she would do it
when the moment came as the archbishop was passing in front of the pupils mademoiselle bouchard to the indescribable terror of her companions stepped out of the ranks and said monseigneur a day's leave of absence
mademoiselle bouchard was tall blooming with the prettiest little rosy face in the world
m
sequel en smiled and said what my dear child a day's leave of absence
three days if you like
i grant you three days
the prior rss could do nothing the archbishop had spoken
horror of the convent buy job of the pupil
the effect may be imagined
this stern cloister was not so well walled off however but that the life of the passions of the outside world drama and even romance did not make their way in
to prove this we will confine ourselves to recording here and to briefly mentioning a real and in cortez table fact which however bears no reference in itself to and is not connected by any thread whatever with the story which we act relating
we mention the fact for the sake of completing the physiognomy of the convent in the reader's mind
about this time there was in the convent a mysterious person who was not a nun who was treated with great respect and who was addressed as madame albertine
nothing was known about her save that she was mad and that in the world she passed for dead
beneath this history it was said the relay the arrangements of fortune necessary for a great marriage
this woman hardly thirty years of age of dark complexion and tolerably pretty had a vague look in her large black eyes
could she set
there was some doubt about this
she glided rather than walked she never spoke it was not quite known whether she breathed
her nostrils were livid and pinched as after yielding up their last sigh
to touch her hand was like touching snow
she possessed a strange spectral grace
wherever she entered people felt cold
one day a sister on seeing her pass said to another sister she passes for a dead woman
perhaps she is one replied the other
a hundred tales were told of madame albertine
this arose from the eternal curiosity of the pupils
in the chapel there was a gallery calledl' oeil de boeuf
it was in this gallery which had only a circular nagano wilde boeuf that madame albertine listened to the offices
she always occupied it alone because from this gallery being on the level of the first story the preacher of the officiating priest could be seen which was interdicted to the nuns
one day the pulpit was occupied by a young priest of high rank m
le duc de rohan left of france officer of the red musketeers in when he was prince de leon and who died afterward in as cardinal and archbishop of besancon
it was the first time that m
de rohan had preached at the petit pick us convent
madame albertine usually preserved perfect calmness and complete immobility during the sermons and services
that day as soon as she caught sight of m
de rohan's behalf rose and said in a loud voice amid the silence of the chapel am
auguste
the whole community turned their heads in amazement the preacher raised his eyes but madame albertine had relapsed into her immobility
a breath from the outer world a flash of life had passed for an instant across that cold and lifeless face and had then vanished and the mad woman had become a corpse again
those two words however had set everyone in the convent who had the privilege of speech to chattering
how many things were contained in that an
auguste
what revelations
m
de rohan's name really was auguste
it was evident that madame albertine belonged to the very highest society since she knew m
de rohan and that her own rank there was of the highest since she spoke thus familiarly of so great a love and that there existed between them some connec tion of relationship perhaps but a very close one in any case since she knew his pet name
two very severe duchesse's mesdames we choose up and sewer ent often visited the community whither they pens heated no doubt in virtue of the profile re magnates julie red and caused great consternation in the boarding school
when these two old ladies passed by all the poor young girls trembled and dropped their eyes
moreover m
de rohan quite unknown to himself was an object of attention to the school girls
at that epoch he had just been made while waiting for the episcopate vicar general of the archbishop of paris
it was one of his habits to come to israhl gotten to celebrate the offices in the chapel of the nuns of the petit pic pic
not one of the young recluse's could see him because of the serge curtain but he had a sweet and rather shrill voice which they had come to know and to distinguish
he had been a no issue faire and then he was said to be very coquettish that his handsome brown hair was very well dressed in a roll around his head and that he had a broad girdle of magnificent moore and that his black cassock was of the most elegant cut in the world
he held a great place in all these imaginations of sixteen years
not a sound from without made its way into the convent
but there was one year when the sound of a flute penetrated thither
this was an event and the girls who were at school there at the time still recall of
it was a flute which was played in the neighborhood
this flute always played the same air an air which is very far away nowadays my setup become reigno'er my soul and it was heard two or three times a day
the young girls passed hours in listening to it the vocal mothers were upset by it brains were busy punishments descended in showers
this lasted for several months
the girls were all more or less in love with the unknown musician
each one dreamed that she was setup be
the sound of the flute proceeded from the direction of the rue de kit mug and they would have given anything compromised everything attempted anything for the sake of seeing of catching a glance if only for a second of the young man who played that flute so deliciously and who no doubt played on all these souls at the same time
there were some who made their escape by a backdoor and ascended to the third story on the rue de out mur side in order to attempt to catch a glimpse through the gaps
impossible
one even went so far as to thrust her arm through the grating and to save her white handkerchief
two were still holder
they found means to climb on a roof and risked their lives there and succeeded at last in seeing the young man
he was an old emigre gentleman blind and penniless who was playing his flute in his attic in order to pass the time
chapter vi the little convent in this enclosure of the petit pic pic there were three perfectly distinct buildings the great convent inhabited by the nuns the boarding school where the scholars were lodged and lastly what was called the little convent
it was a building with a garden in which lived all sorts of aged nine of various orders the relics of cloisters destroyed in the revolution are union of all the black gray and white medleys of all communities and all possible varieties what might be called if such a coupling of words is permissible a sort of harlequin convent
when the empire was established all these poor old dispersed and exiled women had been accorded permission to come and take shelter under the wings of the bernardine's benedictines
the government paid them a small pension the ladies of the petit pic pic received them cordially
it was a singular pwllheli
each followed her own rule sometimes the pupils of the boarding school were allowed as a great recreation to pay them a visit the result is that all those young memories have retained among other souvenirs that of mother sainte basile mother saint esc plastique and mother jacob
one of these refugees found herself almost at home
she was a nun of saint sauce the only one of her order who had survived
the ancient convent of the ladies of saint eau de occupied at the beginning of the eighteenth century this very house of the petit pic pic which belonged later to the benedictines of martin verna
this holy woman too poor to wear the magnificent habit of her order which was a white robe with a scarlet scapular thaw piously put it on a little manikin which she exhibited with complacency and which she bequeathed to the house after death
in only one jun of this order remained today there remains only a doll
in addition to these worthy mothers some old society women had obtained permission of the prior ass like madame albertine to retire into the little convent
among the number were madame beaufortd' half poul and marquise dufresne
another was never known in the convent except by the formidable noise which she made when she blew her nose
the pupils called her madame va car mini hubbub
about or madame de gen los who was at that time editing a little periodical publication calledl' intrepids asked to be allowed to enter the convent of the petit pic lucas lady resident
the ducd' orleans recommended her
uproar in the hive the vocal mothers were all in a flutter madame de genius had made romances
but she declared that she was the first to detect them and then she had reached her fierce stage of devotion
with the aid of god and of the prince she entered
she departed at the end of six or eight months alleging as a reason that there was no shade in the garden
the nuns were delighted
although very old she still played the harp and did it very well
when she went away she left her mark in her cell
madame de genius was superstitious and a la finish
these two words furnish a tolerably good profile of her
a few years ago there were still to be seen pasted in the inside of a little cupboard in her cell in which she locked up her silverware and her jewels these five lines in latin written with her own hand in red ink on yellow paper and which in her opinion possessed the property of frightening away robbers in paribus meritus pendent triad of por aramis d is made the xmas media est did it all text axapta petite is mason felix intimates has no set re snow trax conserver summa potest as
his versus visas jet if it to thaler was
these verses in sixth century latin raise the question whether the two thieves of calvary were named as is commonly believed dismas and gas tax or dismas and yes max
this orthography might have confounded the pretensions put forward in the last century by the vicomte de test as of a descent from the wicked thief
however the useful for the attached to these verses forms an article of faith in the order of the hospital legs
the church of the house constructed in such a manner as to separate the great convent from the boarding school like a veritable in french ment was of course common to the boarding school the great convent and the little convent
the public was even admitted by a sort of lazare tto entrance on the street
but all was so arranged that none of the inhabitants of the cloister could see a face from the outside world
suppose a church whose choir is grasped in a gigantic hand and folded in such a manner as to form not as in ordinary churches a prolongation behind the altar but a sort of hall or obscure cellar to the right of the officiating priest suppose this hall to be shut off by a curtain seven feet in height of which we have already spoken in the shadow of that curtain pole upon wooden stalls the nuns in the child on the left the school girls on the right the lay sisters and the novices at the bottom and you will have some idea of the nuns of the petit pic pic assisting at divine service
that cavern which was called the choir communicated with the cloister by a lobby
the church was lighted from the garden
when the nuns were present at services where their rule enjoined silence the public was warned of their presence only by the folding seats of the stalls noisily rising and falling
chapter vii some silhouettes of this darkness during the six years which separate from the prioress of the petit pic pic was mademoiselle de bien sur whose name in religion was mother innocents
she came of the family of marguerite de bien sur author of lives of the saints of the order of saint benoit
she had been reelected
she was a woman about sixty years of age short thick singing like a cracked pot says the letter which we have already quoted an excellent woman moreover and the only merry one in the whole convert and for that reason adored
she was learned erudite wise competent curiously proficient in history crammed with latin stuffed with greek full of hebrew and more of a benedictine monk than a benedictine jun
the sub prioress was an old spanish jun mother cinerea who was almost blind
the most esteemed among the vocal mothers were mother sainte honoring the treasurer mother sainte gertrude the chief mistress of the novice's mother saint anne the assistant mistress mother ann on ciation the sacri stan mother saint augustin the nurse the only one in the convent who was malicious then mother sainte mech tilde mademoiselle gay vain very young and with a beautiful voice mother des anges mademoiselle drouet who had been in the convent of the filled dieu and in the convent du tresor between his or sandman my mother saint joseph mademoiselle de fogo loudon other sainte adelaide mademoiselled' au verney mother mode risorse mademoiselle de cifuentes who could not resist austerities mother compassion mademoiselle de la multi see received at the age of sixty in defiance of the rule and very wealthy mother providence mademoiselle del' audi miers mother presentation mademoiselle de sigue nsa who was prioress in and finally mother saints deligne sister of the sculptor serac chi who went mad mother saints chantal mademoiselle de sus on who went mad
there was also among the prettiest of them a charming girl of three and twenty who was from the isle de bourbon a descendant of the chevalier rose whose name had been mademoiselle rose and who was called mother assumption
mother sainte mech tolde intrusted with the singing and the choir was fond of making use of the pupils in this quarter
she usually took a complete scale of them that is today's even from tengo sixteen years of age inclusive of assorted voices and sizes whom she made sing standing drawn up in a line side by side according to age from the smallest to the largest
this presented to the eye something in the nature of a reed pile of young girls a sort of living pan pipe made of angels
those of the key sisters whom the scholars loved most were sisters up gracie sister sainte marguerite sister sainte matthew how a singer dotage and sister sainte michel whose long nose made them laugh
all these women were gentle with the children
the nuns were severe only towards themselves
no fire was lighted except in the school and the food was choice compared to that in the convent
moreover they lavished a thousand cards on their scholars
only when a child passed near a nun and addressed her thehun never replied
this rule of silence had had this effect that throughout the whole convent speech had been withdrawn from human creatures and bestowed on inanimate objects
now it was the church bell which spoke now it was the gardener's bell
a very sonorous bell placed beside the port fees and which was audible throughout the house indicated by its varied peaks which formed a sort of acoustic telegraph all the actions of material life which were to be performed and summoned to the parlor in case of need such of such an inhabitant of the house
each person and each thing had its own peak
the prioress had one and one the sub prioress one and two
six five announced lessons so that the pupils never said to go to lessons but to go to six five
four four was madame de genius's signal
it was very often heard
c'est le diable a quatre it's the very deuce said the uncharitable
t engine strokes announced a great event
it was the opening of the door of seclusion a frightful sheet of iron bristling with bolts which only turned on its hinges on the presence of the archbishop
with the exception of the archbishop and the gardener no man entered the convent as we have already said
the school girls saw two other done the chaplain the abbe babes old and ugly whom they were permitted to contemplate in the choir through a grating the other the drawing master m
ansi aux whom the letter of which we have perused a few lines dallam
and joy and describes as a frightful old hunchback
it will be seen that all these men were carefully chosen
such was this curious house
chapter viii postcode a lapides after having sketched its moral face it will not prove unprofitable to point out in a few words its material configuration
the reader already has some idea of it
the convent of the petit pic pic sainte antoine filled almost the whole of the vast trapezium which resulted from the intersection of the tiepolo nc eau the rue droit hurt her he petit pic pic and the unused land called the aymara is on old plans
these four streets surrounded this trapezium like a moat
the convent was composed of several buildings and a garden
the principal building taken in its entirety was a juxtaposition of hybrid constructions which viewed from a bird's eye view outlined with considerable exactness a gibbet laid flat on the ground
the main arm of the gibbet occupied the whole of the fragment of the rue de kit mug comprised between the rue petit pic pic and the tiepolo nc eau the lesser arm was a lofty tray severe grated facade which faced the rue petit picpic the carriage entrance no
marked its extremity
towards the centre of this facade was all watched door whitened with dust and ashes where the spider's wife their webs and which was open only for an hour or two on sundays and on rare occasions when the coffin of an un left the convent
this was the public entrance of the church
the elbow of the gibbet was a square mall which was used as the servants' hall and which the nuns called the buttery
in the main arm were the cells of the mother's the sisters and the novices
in the lesser arm lay the kitchens the refectory backed up by the cloisters and the church
between the door no
and the corner of the closed la jean marais was the school which was not visible from without
the remainder of the trapezium formed the garden which was much lower than the level of the rue pol once au which caused the walls to be very much higher on the inside than on the outside
the garden which was slightly arched had in its centre on the summit of a top pick a fine pointed and conical fir tree whence ran as from the peaked boss of a shield four grand alleys and ranged by twos in between the branching's of these eight small ones so that if the enclosure had been circular the geometrical plan of the alleys would have resembled a cross superposed on a wheel
as the alleys all ended in the very irregular walls of the garden they were of unequal length
they were bordered with currant fishes
at the bottom an alley of tall poplars ran from the ruins of the old convent which was at the angle of the rue de kit mug to the house of the little convent which was at the angle of the aymara island
in front of the little convent was what was called the little garden
to this whole let the reader add a courtyard all sorts of varied angles formed by the interior buildings prison walls the long black line of roofs which bordered the other side of the rue pol once au for its sole perspective and neighborhood and he will be able to form for himself a complete image of what the house of the bernardine's of the petit pic pic was forty years ago
this holy house had been built on the precise site of a famous tennis ground of the fourteenth to the sixteenth century which was called the tennis ground of the eleven thousand devils
all these streets moreover were more ancient than paris
these names droit miranda im a raid are very ancient the streets which bear they are very much more ancient still
aymara island was called main outland the rue de kit mug was called the rue de wet pantie rs for god opened flowers before man cut stones
chapter is a century under a gui mpe since we are engaged in giving details as to what the convent of the petit pic pic was informed times and since we have ventured to open a window on that discreet retreat the reader will permit is one other little digression utterly foreign to this book bit characteristic and useful since it shows that the cloister even has its original figures
in the little convent there was a centenarians no came from the abbey of forte brault
she had even been in society before the revolution
she talked a great deal of m
de niro mesnil keeper of the seals under louis xvi
and of a president rss du play with whom she had been very intimate
it was her pleasure and her vanity to drag in these names on every pretext
she told wonders of the abbey of fonts brault that it was like a city and that there were streets in the monastery
she talked with a picard accent which amused the pupils
every year she solemnly renewed her vows and at the moment of taking the oath she said to the priest monseigneur saint francois gave it to monseigneur saint julien monseigneur saint julien gave it to monseigneur saint eusebius monseigneur saint eusebius gave it to monseigneur saint procopius etc.
etc.
and thus i give it to you father
and the school girls would begin to laugh not in their sleeves but under their veils charming little stifled laughs which made the vocal mothers brown
on another occasion the centenarians as telling stories
she said that inter youth the bernardine monks were every who has good as the mousa yet aires
it was a century which spoke through her but it was the eighteenth century
she told about the custom of the four winds which existed before the revolution in champagne and bourgogne
when a great person area marshal of france a prince a duke and a peer traversed a town in burgundy or champagne the city fathers came out to harangue him and presented him with four silver gondolas into which they had poured four different sorts of wine
in the first goblet this inscription could be dead monkey wine on the second lion wine on the third sheep wine on the fourth hot wine
these four legends express the four stages descended by the drunkard the first intoxication which enlivens the second that which irritates the third that which fills and the fought that which brutalize q
in a cupboard under lock and key she kept a mysterious object of which she thought a great deal
the rule off on feb fault did not forbid this
she would not show this object to anyone
she shut herself up which had rule allowed her to do and his herself every time that she desired to contemplate it
if she heard a footstep in the corridor she closed the cupboard again as hastily as it was possible with her aged hands
as soon as it was mentioned to her she became silent she who was so fond of talking
the most curious were baffled by her silence and the most tenacious by her obstinacy
thus it furnishes a subject or comment for all those who were unoccupied or bored in the convent
what could that treasure of the cents marianne which was so precious and so secret
some holy book no doubt
some unique chaplet
some authentic relic
they lost themselves in conjectures
when the poor old woman died they rushed to her cupboard more hastily than was fitting perhaps and opened it
they found the object beneath a triple linen cloth like some consecrated paren
it was a faenza platter representing little loves flitting away pursued by apothecary laws armed with enormous syringes
the chase abounds in grimaces and on comical pictures
one of the charming little lives is already fairly sputter
he is resisting fluttering hosting wings and still making an effort to fly but the dancer is laughing with a satanic a pair
moral love conquered by the colic
this platter which is very curious and which had possibly the honor of furnishing moliere with an idea was still in existence in september it was for sale by african rac merchant in the boulevard beaumarchais
this good old woman would not receive any visits from outside because said she the parlor is too gloomy
chapters origin of the perpetual adoration however this almost sepulchral parlor of which we have sought to convey an idea is a purely local trait which is not reproduced with the same severity in other convents
at the convent of the rue du temple in particular which belonged in truth to another order the black shutters were replaced by brown curtains and the parlor itself was a salon with a polished wood floor whose windows were draped in white muslim curtains and whose walls admitted all sorts of frames a portrait of a benedictine jun with unveiled face painted bouquets and even the head of a turk
it is in that garden of the temple convent that stood that famous chestnut tree which was renowned as the finest and the largest in france and which bore the reputation among the good people of the eighteenth century of being the father of all the chestnut trees of the realm
as we have said this convent of the temple was occupied by genre of times of the perpetual adoration benedictines quite different from those who depended on coteaux
this order of the perpetual adoration is not very ancient and does not go back more than two hundred years
in the holy sacrament was profane won two occasions a few days apart in two churches in paris at saint sulpice and at saint jean en breve a rare and frightful sacrilege which set the whole town in an uproar
m
the prior and vicar general of saint germain des pres ordered a solemn procession of all his clergy in which the pope's nuncio officiated
but this expiation did not satisfy two sainted women madame court in marquise de boyce and the comtesse de chateau vieux
this outrage committee on the most holy sacrament of the altar though but temporary would not depart from these holy souls and it seemed to them that it could only be eaten hated by a prep egual adoration in some female monastery
both of them one in the other in. made donations of notable sums to mother catherine de bar called of the holy sacrament a benedictine jun for the purpose of founding to this pooh send a monastery of the order of saint benoit the first permission for this foundation was given to mother catherine de barnum
de metz abbe of saint germain or condition that no woman could be received unless she contributed three hundred livres income which amounts to six thousand livres to the principal
after the abbe of saint germain the king accorded letters patent and all these staff arial charter and royal letters was confirmed in by the chamber of accounts and the parliament
such is the origin of the legal consecration of the establishment of the benedictines of the perpetual adoration of the holy sacrament at paris
their first convent was a new building in the rue cassette out of the contributions of mesdames feb pics and we chateau vieux
this order as it will be seen was not to be confounded with the benedictine nuns of coteaux
it mounted back to the abbe of saint germain des pres in the same manner that the ladies of the sacred heart go back to the general of the jesuits and the sisters of charity to the general of the lazarus ts
it was also totally different from the bernardine soft map shot pic pic whose interior we have just shown
in pope alexander vii
had authorized by a special brief the bernardine's of the eye petit ok cpus to practise the perpetual adoration like the benedictine huns of the holy sacrament
but the two orders remained distinct nonetheless
chapter xi end of the petit pico us at the beginning of the restoration the content of the petit pic pic was in its decay this form as part of the general death of the order which after the eighteenth century has been disappearing like all the religious orders
contemplation is like prayer one of humanity's needs but like everything which the revolution touched it will be transformed and from being hostile to social progress it will become favorable to it
the house of the petit pic pic was becoming rapidly depopulated
in the little convent had disappeared the school had disappeared
there were no longer any old women hot young girls the first we're dead the latter had taken their departure
vol a very nt
the rule of the perpetual adoration is so rigid in its nature that it alarms vocations recoil before it the order receives no recruits
in it still obtained lay sisters here and there
but of processed nuns none shall
forty years ago the nuns numbered nearly a hundred fifteen years ago there were not more than twenty eight of them
how many are there today
in the prior rss was young a sign that the circle of choice was restricted
she was not forty years old
in proportion as the number diminishes the fatigue increases the service of each becomes more painful the moment could then be seen drawing near when there would be but a dozen bent and aching shoulders to bear the heavy rule of saint benoit
the burden is implacable and remains the same for there was for the many
it weighs down it crushes
thus they die
at the period when the author of this book still lived in paris two died
one was twenty five years old the other twenty three
this latter can say like julia all in uk which a ceo
did i am now bigint lettres
it is in consequence of this decay that the content gave up the education of girls
we have not felt able to pass before this extraordinary house without entering it and without introducing the minds which accompany us and which are listening to our tale to the profit of some perchance of the melancholy history of jean valjean
we have penetrated into this community full of those old practices which seem so nobel today
it is the closed garden hortus convoys us
we have spoken of this singular place in detail but with respect insofar at least as detail and respect are compatible
we do not understand all but we insult nothing
we are equally far removed from the hosanna of joseph de maistre who wound up by anointing the executioner and from the sheer of voltaire who even goes so far as to ridicule the cross
an illogical act on voltaire's part we may remark by the way for voltaire would have defended jesus as he defended salad and even for those who deny super human incarnations what does the crucifix represent
the assassinated sage
in this nineteenth century the religious idea is undergoing a crisis
people are in learning certain things and they do well provided that while in learning them they learnt his there is no vacuum in the human heart
certain demolitions take place and it is well that they do but on condition that they are followed by reconstruct ions
in the meantime let us study things which are no more
it is necessary to know them if only for the purpose of avoiding them
the counterfeits of the past assume false names and gladly call themselves the future
this spectre this past is given to falsifying its own passport
let us inform ourselves of the trap
let us be on our guard
the past has a visage superstition and a mask hypocrisy
let us denounce the visage and let us head off the mask
as for convents they present a complex problems question of civilization which condemns them a question of liberty which protects them
book seventh
parenthesis chapter i. the convent as an abstract idea this book is a drama whose leading personage is the infinite
man is the second
such being the case and a convent having happened to be on our road it has been out duty to enter or
why
because the convent which is common to the orient as well as to the occident to antiquity as well as to modern times to paganism to buddhism to mahomet amish as well as to christianity is one of the optical apparatuses applied human to the infinite
this is not the place for enlarging did proportionately on certain ideas nevertheless while absolutely maintaining our reserves our restrictions and even our indignation see must say that everytime we encounter man in the infinite either well krill understood as feel ourselves overpowered with respect
there is in the synagogue in the mosque in the pagoda in the wigwam a hideous side which we exec rate and a sublime side which we adore
what a contemplation for the mind and what endless food for thought is the reverberation of god upon the human wall
chapter ii the convent as an historical fact from the point of view of history of reason and of truth mon activism is condemned
monasteries when they abound in a nation are clogs in its circulation dumb to us establishments centres of idleness where centres of labor should exist
monastic communities are to the great social community what the mistletoe is to the oak what the wart is to the human body
their prosperity and their fatness mean the impoverishment of the country
the monastic regime good at the beginning of civilization useful in the reduction of the brutal by the spiritual is bad when peoples have reached their manhood
moreover when it becomes relaxed and when it enters into its period of disorder it becomes bad for the very reasons which rendered it salutary in its period of purity because it still continues to set the example
claus tration has had it's day
cloisters useful in the early education of modern civilization have embarrassed its growth and are injurious to its development
so far as institution and formation with relation to manage concerned monasteries which were good in the tenth century questionable in the fifteenth are detectable in the nineteenth
the leprosy of monasticism has gnawed nearly to a skeleton two wonderful nations italy and spa in the one the light the other the splendor of europe for centuries and at the present day these two illustrious peoples are but just beginning to conv alesse thanks to the healthy and rigorous hygiene of a line

the spanish convent is the most funereal of all
there rise in obscurity beneath vaults filled with gloom beneath comes vague with shadow massive altars of babel as high as cathedrals there immense white crucifixes hang from chains in the dark there are extended all nude on the ebony great christ's of ivory more than bleeding bloody hideous and magnificent with their elbows displaying the bones their kneeland showing their integument's their wounds showing their flesh crowned with silverthorne nailed with nails of gold with blood drops of rubies in their brows and diamond tears in their eyes
the diamonds and rubies seek web and make veiled beings in the shadow below deep their sides bruised with the hair shirt and their icon tipped scourges their breasts crushed with wicker hurdles their knees excoriated with prayer women who think themselves wives spectres who think themselves seraphim

superstitions big orgies affected devotion prejudices those forms all forms as they are are tenacious of life they have teeth and nails in their smoke and they must be clasped close body to body and war must be made on them and that without truce for it is one of the fatalities of humanity to be condemned to eternal combat with phantoms
it is difficult to seize darkness by the throat and to the lot to the earth
a convent in france in the broad daylight of the nineteenth century is a college of owls facing the light
a cloister caught in the very act of asceticism in the very heart of the city of' and of and of rome blossoming out in paris is an anachronism
in ordinary times in order to dissolve an anachronism and to cause it to vanish one has only to make it spell out the date
but we are not in ordinary times
let us fight
let us fight but let us make a distinction
the peculiar property of truth is never to commit excesses
what need has it of exaggeration
there is that which it is necessary to destroy and there is that which it is simply necessary to elucidate and examine
what a force is kindly and serious examination
let us not apply a flame where only a light is required
so given the nineteenth century we are opposed as a general proposition and among all peoples in asia as well as in europe in india as well as in turkey to ascetic claus tration
whoever says cloister says marsh
their pure essence is evident their stagnation is unhealthy their fermentation infects people with fever and etools tvs them their multiplication becomes a plague of egypt
we can not think without affright of those lands where fakir sbin see cantons greek monks mar about et al spoons and dervishes multiply even like swarms of vermin
this said the religious question remains
this question has certain mysterious almost formidable sites may we be permitted to look at it fixedly
chapter iv the convent from the point of view of principles menu note themselves and dwell in communities
by virtue of what right
by virtue of the right of association
they shut themselves up at home
by virtue of what right
by virtue of the right which every man has to open or shut his door
they do not come forth
by virtue of what right
by virtue of the right to go and come which implies the right to remain at home
there at home what do they do
they speak in post ones they drop their eyes they tool
they renounce the world town seen qualities pleasures vanities price interests
they are clothed in coarse woolley or coarse linen
not one of them possesses in his own right anything whatever
on entering there each one who was rich makes himself poor
what he has he gives to all
he who was what is called noble a gentleman and a lord is the equal of him who was a peasant
the call is identical for all
all undergo the same ton sure wear the same fricke at the same black bread sleep on the same straddle on the same as he's
the same sack on their backs the same rope around their loins
if the decision had been to go barefoot all go barefoot
there may be a prince among them that prince is the same shadow as the rest
no titles
even family names have disappeared
they bear only first names
all age bowed beneath the equality of baptismal names
they have dissolved the carnal family and constituted in their community a spiritual family
they have no other relatives than all men
they succor the poor they care for the sick
they elect those whom they obey
they call each other my brother
you stop me and exclaim but that is the ideal convent
it is sufficient that it may be the possible convent that i should take notice of it
thence it results that in the preceding book i have spoken of a convent with respectful accents
the middle ages cast aside asia cast aside the historical and political question held in reserve from the purely philosophical point of view outside the requirements of militant policy on condition that the monastery shall be absolutely a voluntary matter and shall contain only consenting parties i shall always consider a cloistered community with a certain attentive and in some respects a deferential gravity
wherever there is a community there is a commune where there is a commune there is right
the monastery is the product of the formula equality fraternity
oh
how grandis liberty
and what a splendid transfiguration
liberty suffices to transform the monastery into a republic
let us continue
but these men of these women who are behind these four walls
they dress themselves in coarse woollen they are equals they call each other brothers that is well but they do something else
yes
what
they gaze on the darkness they kneel and they clasp their hands
what does this signify
chapter v prayer they pray
to whom
to god
to pray to god what is the meaning of these words
is there an infinite beyond us
is that infinite there inherent permanent necessarily substantial since it is infinite and because if it lacked matter it would be bounded necessarily intelligent since it is infinite and because if it packed intelligence it would end there
does this infinite awaken in us the idea of essence while we can attribute to ourselves only the idea of existence
in other terms is it not the absolute of which we are only the relative
at the same time that there is an infinite without us is there not an infinite within us
she got these two infinite set at an alarming plural
superposed the one upon the other
is not this second infinite so to speak subj a cent to the first
is it not the latter's mirror reflection echo an abyss which is concentric with another abyss
is this second infinity intelligent also
does it think
does it love
does it will
if these two infinities are intelligent each of them has a will principle and there is ani in the upper infinity as there is an lib the lower infinity
the inflow is the soul the ion high is god
to place the infinity here below in contact by the medium of thought with the infinity on high is called praying
let us take nothing from the human mind to suppress is bad
we must reform and transform
certain faculties in manage directed towards the unknown thought r every prayer
the unknown is an ocean
what is conscience
it is the compass of the unknown
thought're very prayer these are great and mysterious radiations
let us respect them
whither to these majestic irradiation's of the soul
into the shadow that is to say to the light
the grandeur of democracy is to disown nothing and to deny nothing of humanity
close to the right of the man beside it at the least there exists the right of the soul
to crush fanaticism and to generate the infinite such is the law
let us not confine ourselves to prostrating ourselves before the tree of creation and to the contemplation of its branches full of stars
we have a duty to labor over the human soul to defend the mystery against the miracle to adore the in comprehensible and reject the absurd to admit as an inexplicable fact only what is necessary to purify belief to remove superstitions from above religion to clear god of caterpillars
chapter vi the absolute goodness of prayer with regard to the modes of prayer all are good provided that they are sincere
turn your book upside down and be in the infinite
there is as we know a philosophy which denies the infinite
there is also a philosophy pathologic ally classified which denies the sun this philosophy is called blindness
to erect a sense which we lack into a source of truth is a fine blind man's self sufficiency
the curious thing is the haughty superior and compassionate airs which this groping philosophy assumes towards the philosophy which he holds god
one fancied he hear sample crying i pity them with their sun
there are as we know powerful and illustrious atheists
at bottom led back to the truth by their very force they are not absolutely sure that they are atheists it is with them only a question of definition and in any case if they do not believe in god being great minds they prove god
we salute them as philosophers while inexorably denouncing their philosophy
let us go on
the remarkable thing about it is also their facility in paying themselves off with words
a metaphysical school of the north impregnated to some extent with dog has fancied that it has worked a revolution in human understanding by replacing the word force with the word will
to say the plant will z instead of the plant grows this would be fecund in results in desc if we were to add the universe wills
why
because it would come to this the plant wills therefore it has ann the universe wills therefore it has a god
as for us who however in contra distinction to this school reject nothing apriori a will in the plant accepted by this school appears to us more difficult to admit than a will in the universe denied by it
to deny the will of the infinite that is to say god is impossible on any other conditions than a denial of the infinite
we have demonstrated this
the negation of the infinite leads straight to nihilism
everything becomes a mental conception
with nihilism no discussion is possible for the nihilist logic doubts the existence of its interlocutor and is not quite sure that it exists itself
from its point of view it is possible that it may be for itself only a mental conception
only it does not perceive that all which it has denied it admits in the lump simply by the utterance of the word mind
in short no way is open to the thought by a philosophy which makes all end in the mono syllable no
to go there is only one reply yes
nihilism has no point
there is no such thing as nothingness
zero does not exist
everything is something
nothing is nothing
man lives by affirmation even more than by bread
even to see and to show does not suffice
philosophy should be an energy it should have for effort and effect to ameliorate the condition of man
socrates should enter into adam and produce marcus aurelius in other words the man of wisdom should be made to emerge from the man of felicity
eden should be changed into a lyceum
science should be a cordial
to enjoy what a sad aim and what a paltry ambition
the brute enjoys
to offer thought to the thirst of men to give them all as an elixir the notion of god to make conscience and science frater nose in them to render them just by this mysterious confrontation such is the function of real philosophy
morality is a blossoming out of truths
contemplation leads to action
the absolute should be practicable
it is necessary that the ideal should be breathable drinkable and eat able to the human mind
it is the ideal which has the right to say take this
it is on this condition that it ceases to be a sterile love of science and becomes the one and sovereign mode of human rallying and that philosophy herself is promoted to religion
philosophy should not be a corbel erected on mystery to gaze upon it at its ease without any other result than that of being convenient to curiosity
for our part adjourning the development of our thought to another occasion we will confine ourselves to saying that we neither understand man as a point of departure now progress as an end without those two forces which are their two motors faith and love
progress is the goal the ideal is the type
what is this ideal
it is god
ideal absolute perfection infinity identical words
chapter vii precautions to be observed in blame history and philosophy have eternal duties which are at the same time simple duties to combat call has the high priest draco the lawgiver grimaldi on the legislator tiberius the emperor this is clear direct and limpid and offers no obscurity
but the right to live apart even with its inconveniences and its abuses insists on being states and taken into account
denon it is miss human problem
when one speaks of convents those abodes of error but of innocence of aberration but of goodwill of ignorance but of devotion of torture but of martyrdom it always becomes necessary to say either yes or no
a convent is a contradiction
its object salvation its means there to sacrifice
the convent us supreme egoism having for its result supreme abnegation
to abdicate with the object of reigning seems to be the device of monasticism
in the cloister one suffers in order to enjoy
one draws a bill of exchange on death
one discounts in terrestrial gloom celestial light
in the cloister hell is accepted in advance as a post on it on paradise
the taking of the veil of the trick is a suicide paid for with eternity
it does not seem to us that on such a subject mockery is permissible
all about it is serious the good as well as the bad
the just man frowns but never smiles with a malicious sheet
we understand wrath but not malice
chapter viii faith laws few words more
we blame the church when she is saturated with intrigues we despise the spiritual which is harsh toward the temporal but we everywhere honor the thoughtful man
we salute the man who kneels
a faith this is a necessity for man
woe to him who believe zip thing
one is not unoccupied because one is absorbed
there is visible labor and invisible labor
to contemplate is to labor to think is to act
folded arms tool clasped hands work
a gaze fixed in heaven is a work
thales remained motionless for four years
he founded philosophy
in our opinions who bites are not lazy men and recluse's are not idlers
to meditate on the shadow is a serious thing
without invalidating anything that we have just said we believe that a perpetual memory of the tomb is proper fit the living
on this point the priest and the philosopher agree
we must die
the abbe de la trappe replies to horace
to mingle with one's life a certain presence of the sepulchre this is the law of the safe and it is the law of the ascetic
in this respect the ascetic and the ways converge
there is a material growth we admit it
there is a moral grandeur we hold to that
thoughtless and vivacious spirits say what is the good of those motionless figures on the side of mystery
what purpose do they serve
what do they do
alas
in the presence of the darkness which environs us and which awaits us in our ignorance of what the immense dispersion will make it has deeply there is probably no work more divine than that performed by these soils
and we add there is krona but no work which is more useful
there certainly must be some who pray constantly for those who never pray at all
in our opinion the whole question lies in the amount of thought that is mingled with prayer
leibnitz praying is grand voltaire adoring is fine
delete sit voltaire
we are for religion as against religions
we are of the number who believe in the wretchedness of prisons and the sublimity of prayer
moreover at this minute which we are now traversing a minute which will not fortunately leave its impress on the nineteenth century at this hour when so many men have low brows and souls but little elevated among so many mortals whose morality consists in enjoyment and who are busier with the brief and misshapen things of matter who ever exiles himself seems worthy of generation to us
the monastery is a renunciation
sacrifice wrongly directed is still sacrifice
to mistakes grave error for a city has a grandeur of its own
taken by itself and ideally and in order to examine the truth on all sides until all aspects have been impartially exhausted the monastery the female convent in particular for in our century it is woman who suffers the most and in this exile of the cloister there is something of protestation the female convent has incontestably a certain majesty
this cloistered existence which is so austere so depressing a few of whose features we have just traced is not life for it is not liberty it is not the tomb for it is not plenitude it is the strange places hence one behold was from the crest of a lofty mountain on one side the abyss where we are on the other the abyss whither we shall go it is the narrow and misty frontier separating two worlds illuminated and obscured by both at the same time where the day of life which has become enfeebled is mingled with the vague day of death it is the half obscurity of the tomb
we who do not believe what these women believe but who like them live by faith we have never been able to think without a sort of tender and religious terror without a sort of pity that is full of envy of those devoted trembling and trusting creatures of these humble and august souls who dare to dwell on the very brink of the mystery waiting between the world which is closed and heaven which is not yet open turned towards the light which one can not see possessing the cold happiness of thinking that they know where it is aspiring towards the gulf and the unknown their eyes fixed motionless on the darkness kneeling bewildered stupefied shuddering half lifted at times by the deep breaths of eternity
book eighth
cemeteries take that which is committed them chapter i. which treats of the manner of entering a convent it was into this house that jean valjean had a sea uchel event expressed it fallen from the sky
he had scaled the wall of the garden which formed the angle of the rue pol once au
that hymn of the angels which he had heard on the middle of the night was the nuns changing matins that hall of which he had caught a glimpse in the gloom was the chapel
that phantom which he had seen stretched on the ground was the sister who was making reparation that bell the sound of which had so strangely surprised him was the gardener's bell attached to the knee of father gauche le vent
cosette once put to bed jean valjean and rauch eleventh ad as we have already seen supper on a glass of wine and a bit of cheese before a good crackling fire then the only bed in the hut being occupied by cosette each threw himself on a truss of straw
before he shut his eyes jean valjean said i must remain here henceforth
this remark trotted through gauche le vent's head all night long
to tell the truth neither of them slept
jean valjean feeling that he was discovered and that is very was on his scent understood that he and cosette were lost if they returned to paris
then the new storm which had just burst upon him had stranded him in this cloister
jean valjean had henceforth but one thought to remain there
now for an unfortunate man in his position this convent was both the safest and the most dangerous of places the most dangerous because as nomen might enter there if he were discovered it was a flagrant offence and jean valjean would find but one step intervening between the convent and prison the safest because if he could manage to get himself accepted there and remain there who would ever seek him in such a place
to dwell in an impossible place was safety
in his side gauche l event was due telling his brains
he began by declaring to himself that he understood nothing of the matter
how harm
madeleine got there when the walls were what they were
cloister walls are not to be stepped over
how did he get there with a child
one can not scales perpendicular wall with a child in one's arms
who was that child
where did they both come from
since eau che le vent had lived in the convent he had heard nothing of m
shrm
and he knew nothing of what had taken place there
father madeleine had an air which discouraged questions and besides gauche le vent said to himself one does not questions saint
m
madeleine had preserved all his prestige in gauche le vent's eyes
only from some words which jean valjean had let call the gardener thought he could draw the inference that m
madeleine had probably become bankrupt through the hard times and that he was pursued by his creditors or that he had compromised himself in some political affair and was in hiding which last did not displeased such el event who like many of our peasants of the north had an old fund off on a part i am about him
while in hiding m
madeleine had selected the convent as a refuge and it was quite simple that he should wish to remain there
but the inexplicable point to which gauche le vent returned constantly and over which he wearied his brain was that m
madeleine should be there and that he should have that little girl with him
gauche legend saw them touched them spoke to them and still did not believe it possible
the in comprehensible had just made its entrance into gauche le vent's hut
rauch eleventh roped about amid conjectures and could see nothing clearly but this m.
madeleine saved my life
this certainty alone was sufficient and decided his course
he said to himself it is my turn now
he added in his conscience m
madeleine did not stop to deliberate when it was a question of thrusting himself under the cart for the purpose of dragging me out
he made up his mind to save m
madeleine
nevertheless he put many questions to himself and made himself divers replies after what he did for me would leave him if he were a thief
just the same
if he were an assassin would i save him
just the same
since he is a saint shall leave him
just the same
but what a problem it was to manage to have him remain in the convent
gauche le vent did not recoil in the case of this almost chimerical undertaking this poor peasant of picardy without any other ladder than his self devotion his goodwill and a little of that our rustic cunning in this occasion enlisted in the service of a generous enterprise undertook to scape the difficulties of the cloister and the steep escarpments of the rule of saint benoit
father gauche legend was an old man who had been an egoist all his life and who towards the end of his days halton firm with no interest left to him in the world found it sweet to be grateful and perceiving a generous action to be performed flung himself upon it like a man who at the moment when he is dying should find close to his hands glass of good wine which he had never tasted and should swallow it with acidity
we may add that the air which he has breathed for many years in this convent had destroyed all personality in him and has ended by rendering a good action of some kind absolutely necessary to him
so he took his resolve to devote himself tom
madeleine
we have just called him a poor peasant of picardy
that description is just but incomplete
at the point of this story which we have now reached a little of father gauche le vent's physiology becomes useful
he was a peasant but he had been a notary which added trickery to his cunning and penetration to his ingenuous news
having through various causes failed in his business he had descended to the calling of a carter and a laborer
bug in spite of oaths and lashings which horses seem to require something of the notary had lingered in him
he had some natural with stalked good grammar he conversed which is a rare thing in a village and the other peasants said of him he talks almost like a gentleman with a hat
gauche le vent be logged in fact to that species which the impertinent and flippant vocabulary of the last century qualified as demi bourgeois de milo it and which the metaphors showered by the chateau upon the thatched cottage tickets win the pigeon hole of the plebeian rather rustic rather sit ified pepper and salt
gauche le vent though sorely tried and harshly used by date worn out a sort of poor threadbare old soul was nevertheless an impulsive man and extremely spontaneous in his actions a precious quality which prevents one from ever being wicked
his defects and his vices for he had some were all superficial in short his physiognomy was of the kind which succeeds with an observer
his aged case had none of those disagreeable wrinkles at the top of the forehead which signify malice or stupidity
at daybreak father gauche le vent opened his eyes after having done an enormous deal of thinking and be held m
madeleine seated on his truss of straw and watching cosette's slumbers
gauche l events at up and said now that you are here how are you going to contrive to enter
this remark summed up the situation and aroused jean valjean from his refer y
the two men took counsel together
in the first place said rauch elegant you will begin by not setting foot outside of this chamber either you or the child
one step in the garden and we are done for
that is true
monsieur madeleine resumed gauche le vent you have arrived at a very suspicious moment i mean to say a very inauspicious moment one of the ladies is very ill
this will prevent them from looking much in our direction
it seems that she is dying
the prayers of the forty hours are being said
the whole community is in confusion
that occupies the m
the one who is on the point of departure is a saint
in fact we are all saints here all the difference between them and he is that they say' purcell' and that i say' my cabin
' the prayers for the dying are to be said and then the prayers for the dead
we shall be at peace here for today but i will not answer for tomorrow
still observed jean valjean this cottage is in the niche of the wall it is hidden by a sort of ruin there are trees it is not visible from the convent
and i add that the nuns never come near it
well
said jean valjean
the interrogation mark which accentuated this well signified it seems to me that one may remain concealed here
it was to this interrogation point that gauche le vent responded there are the little girls
what little girls
asked jean valjean
just as rauch alegent opened his mouth to explain the words which he had uttered a bell emitted one stroke
the gun is dead said he
there is the knell
and he made a sign to jean valjean to listen
the bell struck a second time
it is the knell monsieur madeleine
the bell will continue to strike once a minute for twenty four hours until the body is taken from the church
you are they play
at recreation hours it suffices to have a ball rolls side to send them all higher in spite of prohibitions to hunt and rummage for it all about here
those cherubs are devils
who
asked jean valjean
the little girls
you would be very quickly discovered
they would shriek' oh
a man
' there is no danger today
there will be no recreation hour
the day will be entirely devoted to prayers
you hear the bell
as i told you a stroke each minute
it is the death knell
i understand father gauche i event
there are pupils
and jean valjean thought to himself here is cosette's education already provided
gauche p event exclaimed la reine
there are little girls indeed
and they would bawl around you
and they would rush off
to be a man here is to have the plague
you see how they fasten a bell to my law as though i were a wild beast
jean valjean fell into more and more profound thought
this convent would be our salvation he murmured
then he raised his voice yes the difficulty is to remain here
no. said gauche levent the difficulty is to get out
jean valjean felt the blood rush back to his heart
to get out
yes monsieur madeleine
in order to return here it is first necessary to get out
and after waiting until another stroke of the knell had sounded faux nel event went on you must not be found here in this fashion
whence come you
for me your all from heaven because i know you but the nuns require one to enter by the door
all at once they heard a rather complicated leaking from another bell
ah
said gay fuel event they are ringing up the vocal mothers
they are going to the chapter
they always hold a chapter when anyone dies
she died at daybreak
people generally do die at daybreak
but can not you get out by the way in which you entered
come i do not ask for the sake of questioning you but how did you get in
jean valjean turned pale the very thought of descending again into that terrible street made him shudder
you make your way out of a forest filled with fibers and once out of it imagine a friendly counsel that shall advise you to return thither
jean valjean pictures to himself the whole police force still engaged in a warming in that quarter agents on the watch sentinels everywhere frightful fists extended towards his collar have that the corner of the intersection of the streets perhaps
impossible
said he
father gauche le vent say that i fell from the sky
but i believe it i believe it retorted gauche le vent
you have no need to tell me that
the good god must have taken you in his hand for the purpose of getting a good look at you close to and then dropped you
only he meant to place you in a man's convent he made a mistake
come there goes another peak that is to order the porter to go and inform the municipality that the dead doctor is to come here and view a corpse
all that is the ceremony of dying
these good ladies are not at all find in that visit
a doctor is a man who does not believe in anything
he lifts the veil
sometimes he lifts something else too
how quickly they have had the doctor summoned this time
what is the matter
your little one is still asleep
what is her name
cosette
she is your daughter
you are her grandfather that is
yes
it will be easy enough for her to get out of here
i havent service door which opens on the courtyard
i knock
the porter opens i have my vintage basket on my back the child is in it i go out
father gauche l event goes out with his basket that is perfectly natural
you will tell the child to keep very quiet
she will be under the cover
i will leave her for whatever time is required with a good old friends fruit seller whom i know in the rus chem invert who is deaf and who has a little bed
i will shout in the fruit seller's ear that she is a niece of time and that she is to keep her for me until tomorrow
then the little one will reenter with you for i will contrive to have you're enter
it must be done
but how will you manage to get out
jean valjean shook his head
no one must see me the whole point lies there father gauche i event
find some means of getting me out in a basket undercover like cosette
gauche le vent scratched the love of his ear with the middle finger of his left hand a sign of serious embarrassment
a third peak created a diversion
that is the dead doctor taking his departure said gauche le vent
he has taken a look and said' she is dead that is well
' when the doctor has signed the passport for paradise the undertaker's company sends a coffin
if it is another them others lay her out if she is a sister the sisters lay her out
after which in all her up
that forms a part of my gardener's duty
a gardener is a bit of a grave digger
she is placed in a lower hall of the church which communicates with the street and into which no man may enter save the doctor of the dead
idon't count the undertaker's men and myself as men
it is in that hall that in xml up the coffin
the undertaker's men come and get it and whip up coachman
that's the way one goes to heaven
they fetch a box with nothing in my they take it away again with something in it
that's what a burial is like
de profundis
a horizontal day of sunshine lightly touched the face of the sleeping cosette who lay with her mouth vaguely open and had the air of an angel drinking in the light
jean valjean had fallen to gazing at her
he was no longer listening to gauche le vent
that one is not listened to is no reason for preserving silence
the good old gardener went on tranquilly with his babble the grave is dug in the day girard cemetery
they declare that they are going to suppress that day girard cemetery
it is an ancient cemetery which is outside the regulations which has no uniform and which is going to retire
it is a shame for it is convenient
i have a friend there father me etienne the grave digger
the nuns here possess one privilege it is to be taken to that cemetery at nightfall
there is a special permission from the prefecture on their behalf
but how many events have happened since yesterday
mother crucifixion is dead and father madeleine is buried said jean valjean smiling sadly
faux tel event caught the word
goodness
if you were here for good it would be a real burial
a fourth peak burst out
gauche le vent hastily detached the balled kneecap from its nail and buckled it in his knee again
this time it is forms
the mother prioress wants me
good now i am pricking myself on the tongue of my buckle
monsieur madeleinedon'ts for from here and wait for me
something new had come up
if you are hungry there is wine bread and cheese
and he hastened out of the hut crying coming
coming
jean valjean watched him hurrying across the garden as fast as his crooked leg would permit casting a sidelong glance by the way on his melon patch
less than ten minutes later father gauche le vent whose fall out the bugs in his road to flight tapped gently at a door and a gentle voice replied forever
forever
that is to say enter
the door was the one leading to the parlor reserved for seeing the gardener on business
this park ifad joined the chapter hall
the prior was seated on the only chair in the parlor was waiting for gauche le vent
chapter ii raid tel event in the presence of a difficulty it is the peculiarity of certain persons and certain professions notably priests and nuts to wear a grave and agitate dalton critical occasions
at the moment when catch el event entered this double form of preps culation was imprinted on the countenance of the prioress who was that wise and charming mademoiselle de glen eur mother innocents who was ordinarily cheerful
the gardener made a timid bow and remained at the door of the cell
the prior see who was telling her beads raised her eyes and said am
it is you father day vent
this abbreviation had been adopted in the convent
rauch eleventh owed again
father day vent i have sent for you
here i am reverend mother
i have something to say to you
and so have i said rauch el event with a boldness which caused him in water error i have something to say to the very reverend mother
the prioress stared at him
ah
you have a communication to make time
a request
very well speak
goodman faux tel event the ex notary belonged to the category of peasants who have assurance
a certain clever ignorance constitutes a force you do not distrust it and you are caught by it
gauche le vent had been a success during the something more than two years which he had passed in the convent
always solitary and busied about his gardening he had nothing else to do than to indulge his curiosity
as he was at a distance from all those veiled women passing to and fro he saw before him only an agitation of shadows
by dint of attention and sharpness he had succeeded in clothing all those phantoms with flesh and those corpses were alive for him
he was like a dead man whose sight grows keener and like a blind man whose hearing becomes more acute
he had applied himself to fiddling out the significance of the different peaks and he had succeeded so that this taciturn and enigmatic al cloister possessed no secrets for him the sphinx babbled all her secrets in his ear
rauch eleven time wall and concealed all that constituted his art
the whole convent thought him stupid
a great merit in religion
the vocal mothers made much of gauche le vent
he was a curious mute
he inspired confidence
moreover he was regular and never went out except for well demonstrated requirements of the orchard and vegetable garden
this discretion of conduct had inured to his credit
nonetheless be bassett women to shattering the poster in the convent and he knew the singularities of their parlor and the grave digger at the cemetery and he was acquainted with the peculiarities of their seoul ture in this way he possessed a double light of the subject of these guys one as to their life the other ad to their death
but he did not abuse his knowledge
the congregation thought a great deal of him
old lake blind to everything probably a little deaf into the bargain what qualities
they would have found it difficult to replace him
the good man with the assurance of a person who feels that he is appreciated entered into a rather diffuse and very deep rustic harangue to the reverend prioress
he talked a longtime about his age his infirmities the surcharge of years counting double for him henceforth of the increasing demands of his work of the great size of the garden of nights which must be passed like the last for instance when he had been obliged to put straw hats over the melon beds because of the moon and he wound up as follows that he had a brother the prioress made a movements brother no longer young a second movement on the part of the prioress but one expressive of reassurance that if he might be permitted this brother would come and live with him and help him that he was an excellent gardener that the community would receive from him good service better than his own that other side of his brother were not admitted as he the elder felt that his health was broken and that he was insufficient for the work he should be obliged greatly to his regret to go away and that his brother had a little daughter whom he would bring with him who might be geared for god in the house and who might who knows become an in some day
when he had finished speaking the prioress stayed the clipping of her rosary between her fingers and said to him could you procure a stout iron bar between now and this evening
for what purpose
to serve as a lever
yes reverend mother replied gauche le vent
the prioress without adding a word rose and entered the adjoining room which was the hall of the chapter and where the vocal mothers were probably assembled
gauche l event was left alone
chapter iii mother innocents about a quarter of an hour elapsed
the prioress returned and seated herself once more on her chair
the two interlocutors seemed preoccupied
we will present a stenographic report of the dialogue which then ensued to the best of our ability
father day vent
reverend mother
do you know the chapel
i have a little cage there where i hear the mass and the offices
and you have been on the choir in pursuance of your duties
two or three times
there is a stone to be raised
heavy
the slab of the pavement which is at the side of the altar
the slab which closes the vault
yes
it would be a good thing to have two men for it
mother ascension who is as strong as a man will help you
a woman is never a man
we have only a woman here to help you
each one does what he can
because comma bill on gives four hundred and seventeen epistles of saint bernard while keep on us horatius only gives three hundred and sixty seven i do not despise me too much led to us
neither do i
merit consists in working according to one's strength
a cloister is not a dockyard
and a woman is not a man
but my brother is the strong one though
and can you get a lever
that is the only sort of key that fits that sort of door
there is a ring on the stone
i will put the lever through it
and the stone is so arranged that its wings on a pivot
that is good reverend mother
i will open the vault
and the four mother percent irs will help you
and when the vault is open
it must be closed again
will that beall
no
give me your orders very reverend mother
fauve nr we have confidence in you
i am here to do anything you wish
and to hold your peace about everything
yes reverend mother
when the vault is open i will close it again
but before that what reverend mother
something must be lowered into it
a silence ensued
the prioress after ap out of the under lip which resembles hesitation broke it
father baigent
reverend mother
you know that a mother died this morning
no
did you not hear the bell
nothing can be heard at the bottom of the garden
really
i can hardly distinguish my own signal
she died at daybreak
and then the wind is not blowing in my direction this morning
it was mother crucifixion
a blessed woman
the prioress paused moved her lips as though it mental prayer and resumed three years ago madame de be thine a jansen ist turned orthodox merely from having seen mother crucifixion at prayer
ah
yes now i hear the knell reverend mother
the mothers have taken her to the dead room which opens on the church
i know
no other man than you can or must enter that chamber
see to that
a fine sight it would be to see a man enter the dead room
more often
hey
more often
what do you say
i say more often
more often than what
reverend mother i did not say more often than what i said more often
idon't understand you
why do you say more often
in order to speak like you reverend mother
but i did not say' more often
' at that moment nineo'clock struck
at nineo'clock in the morning and at all hours praised and adored be the most holy sacrament of the altars and the prior ese
amen same day fuel event
the clock struck opportune ky
it cut more often short
it is probable that had it not been for this the prioress and gauche l event would never have unravelled that skein
rauch eleventh poped his forehead
the prioress indulged in another little inward murmur probably sacred then raised her voice in her lifetime mother crucifixion made converts after her death she will perform miracles
she will
replies father gauche le vent falling into step and striving not to flinch again
father day vent the community has been blessed in mother crucifixion
no doubt it is not granted to everyone to die like cardinal de her hole while saying the holy mass and to breathe forth their souls to god while pronouncing these words hand i got it oblation em
but without straining to such happiness mother crucifixion's death was very precious
she regained her consciousness to the very last moment
she spoke to us then she spoke to the angels
she gave us her last commands
if you had a little more faith and if you could have been in her cell she would have cured your leg merely by touching it
she smiled
we felt that she was regaining her life in god
there was something of paradise in that death
gauche le vent thought that it was an prison which she was finishing
amen said he
father day vent what the dead wish must be done
the prioress took off several beads other chaplet
gauche l event held his peace
she went on i have consulted upon this point many ecclesiastics laboring in our lord who occupy them adored in the exercises of the clerical life and who bear wonderful fruit
reverend mother you can hear the knell much better here than in the garden
besides she is more than a dead woman she is a saint
like yourself reverend mother
she slept in her coffin for twenty years by express permission of our holy father pius vii
the one who crowned the emp buona parts
for a clever man like gauche le vent this allusion was an awkward one
fortunately the prioress completely absorbed in her own thoughts did not hear it
she continued father day vent
reverend mother
saint did it is archbishop of cappadocia desired that this single word might be inscribed on his tomb as a rus which signifies a work of the earth this was done
is this true
yes reverend mother
the blessed mezzo came abbot of aquila wished to be buried beneath the gallows this was done
that is true
dainty been to us bishop of port where the mouth of the tiber empties into the sea requested that on his tomb might be engraved the sign which was placed on the graves of part i codes in the hope that passersby would spit on his tomb
this was done
the dead must be obeyed
so be it
the body of bernard guidon is born in france near roche a veille was as he had ordered and in spite of the king of castile borne to the church of the dominicans in limoges although bernard guido his dad bishop of turin spain
can the contrary be affirmed
for that matter no reverend mother
the fact is attested by plan habit de la fosse
several heads of the chaplet were told off still in silence
the prioress resumed father fauve my mother crucifixion will be interred in the coffin in which she had slept for the last twenty years
that is just
it is a continuation of her slumber
so i shall have to nail up that coffin
yes
and we are to reject the undertaker's coffin
precisely
i am at the orders of the very havereg'd community
the four much we present irs will assist you
in mailing up the coffin
i do not need them
no
in lowering the coffin
where
into the vault
what vault
under the altar
gauche l event started
the vault under the altar
under the altar
but you will have an iron bar
yes but you will raise the stone with the bar by means of the ring
but the dead must be obeyed
to be buried in the vault under the altar of the chapel not to go to profane earth to remain there in death where she prayed while living such was the last wish of mother crucifixion
she asked it of us that is to say commanded us
but it is forbidden
forbidden by men enjoined by god
what if it became known
we have confidence in you
oh
i am a stone in your walls
the chapter assembled
the vocal mothers whom i have just consulted again and who are now deliberating have decided that mother crucifixion shall be buried according to her wish in her own coffin under our alter
think father day vent if she were to work miracles here
what a glory of god for the community
and miracles issue from tombs
but reverend mother of the agent of the sanitary commission saint benoit ii
in the matter of seoul ture resisted constantine logon at us
but the commissary of police cho node maire one of the seven german kings who entered among the gauls under the empire of constantius expressly recognized the right of nuns to be buried in religion that is to say beneath the altar
but the inspector from the prefecture the world is nothing in the presence of the cross
martin the eleventh general of the carthusian's have to his order this device stat crux cum volvo the orbis
amen said gauche le vent who i'm perturb ably extricated himself in this manner from the dilemma whenever he heard latin
any audience suffices for a person who has held his peace too long
on the day when the rhetorician gymnast i had left his prison bearing in his body many dilemmas and numerous syllogisms which had struck in he halted in front of the first tree which he came to harangued it and made very great efforts to convince it
the prioress who was usually subjected to the barrier of silence and whose reservoir was overfull rose and exclaimed with the low us city of adam which has broken away i have on my right benoit and on my left bernard
who was bernard
the first abbot of clairvaux
contained in burgundy is a country that is blest because it gave him birth
his father was named revel in and his mothers of the
he began at rite aid to end in clairvaux he was ordained abbot by the bishop of chalon sur saone guillaume de champ eaux he had seven hundred novices and founded a hundred and sixty monasteries he overthrew a bell are at the council of web sin and pierre de brits and henry his disciple and another sort offering spirits who were called the apostolic she confounded arnauld de brescia darted lightning at the mini raoul the murderer of the jews dominated the council of reims in caused the condemnation of gilbert report a bishop of poitiers caused the condemnation of ron del' etoile arranged the disputes of princes enlightened king louis the young advised pope eugene iii
regulated the temple preached the crusade performed two hundred and fifty miracles during his lifetime and as many as thirty nine in one day
who was benoit
he was the patriarch of mont cassin he was the second founder of the saints tefl austral she was the basil of the west
his order has produced forty poles two hundred cardinals fifth patriarchs sixteen hundred archbishop's four thousand six hundred bishops four emperor's twelve em presses forty six kings forty one queen's three thousand six hundred canonized saints and has been in existence for fourteen hundred years
on one side saint bernard on the other the agent of the sanitary department
on one side saint benoit on the other the inspector of public days
the state the road commissioners the public undertaker regulations the administration what do we know of all that
there is not a chance passerby who would not be indignant to see how we are treated
we have not even the right to give our dust to jesus christ
your sanitary department is a revolutionary invention
god subordinated to the commissary of police such is the age
silence day vent
f such el event was but ill at ease under this shower bath
the prioress continued no one doubts the right of the monastery rose kulture
only fanatics and those in error deny it
we live in times of terrible confusion
we do not know that which it is necessary to know and we know that which we should ignore
we are ignorant and impious
in this are there exist people who do not distinguish between the very great saint bernard and the saint bernard denominated of the poor catholics a certain good ecclesiastic who lived in the thirteenth century
others are so blasphemous as to compare the scaffold of louis xvi
to the cross of jesus christ
louis xvi
was merely a king
let us beware of god
there is no longer just not unjust
the name of voltaire is known but not the name of cesar denis
nevertheless cesar venus is a man of blessed memory and voltaire one of un blessed memory
the last archbishop the cardinal de perigord did not even know that charles de fondren succeeded to be tulle and francois bourgoin to go here nate jean francois de nault to bourgoin and father sainte mar they o jean francois de nault
the name of father coton is known not because he was one of the three who urged the foundation of the orator is but because he furnished henri iv
the huguenot king with the material for an oath
that which pp dawes people of the world in saint francois de sales is that he cheated at play
and then religion is attacked
why
because there have been bad priests because sagittal re bishop of gap was the brother of capone bishop of embrun and because both of them followed him mpl
what had that to do with the question
does that prevent martin de tours from being a saint and giving half of his cloak to a beggar
they persecute the saints
they shut their eyes to the truth
darkness is the rule
the most ferocious beast wars beasts which are blind
no one thinks of hell as a reality
oh
how wicked people are
my order of the long signifies today by order of the revolution
one no longer knows what is due to the living or to the dead
a holy death is prohibited
burial is a civil matter
this is horrible
saint leo ii
write two special letters one to pierre not sure the other to the king of the visigoths for the purpose of combating and rejecting in questions touching the dead the authority of the esarch and the supremacy of the emperor
gauthier bishop of chalons held his own in this matter against it to duke of burgundy
the ancient magistracy agreed with him
in former times we had voices in the chapter even on matters of the day
the abbot of coteaux the general of the order was councillor by right of birth to the parliament of burgundy
we do what we please without dead
is not the body of saint benoit himself in france in the abbey of fleury called saint benoit sur loire although he died in italy at mont cassin on saturday the st. of the month of march of the year
all this is incontestable
i abhor psalm singers i hate prior does estate heretics but i should detect get more anyone who should maintain the contrary
one has only to read arnould ion gabriel bicep intro them is mauro pics and compu cd's chery
the prior see took breath then turned to gauche le vent
is it settled father day vent
it is settled reverend mother
we may depend on you
i will obey
that is well
i am entirely devoted to the convent
that is understood
you will close the coffin
the sisters will carry it to the chapel
the office for the dead will then he said
then we shall return to the cloister
between eleveno'clock and midnight you will come with your iron bar
all will be done in the most profound secrecy
there will be in the chapel only the four mother prevent or smother ascension and yourself
and the sister at the post
she will not turn round
but she will hear
she will not listen
besides what the cloister knows the world learn's not
a pause ensued
the prioress went on you will remove your help
it is not necessary that the sister at the post should perceive your presence
reverend mother
what father faucett
has the doctor for the dead paid his visit
he will pay it at fouro'clock today
the peak which offers the doctor for the dead to be summoned has already been ring
but you do not understand any of the peaks
i pay no attention to any but my own
that is well father day vent
reverend mother a lever at least six feet long will be required
where will you obtain it
where gratings are not lacking iron bars are not lacking
i have my heap of old iron at the bottom of the garden
about three quarters of an hour before midnight do not forget
reverend mother
what
if you were ever to have any other jobs of this sort my brother is the strong man for you
a perfect turk
you will do it as speedily as possible
i can not work very fast
i am inform that is why i require an assistant
i limp
to limp is no sin and perhaps it is a blessing
the emperor henry ii
who combated anti pope gregory and reestablished benoit viii
has two surnames the saint and the lake
two surtout sars a good thing murmured gauche of vegf who really was a little hard of hearing
now that i think of it father baigent let us give a whole hour to it
that is not too much
be near the principal altar with your iron bar at eleveno'clock
the office begins at midnight
everything must have been completed a good quarter of an hour before that
i will do anything to prove my zeal towards the community
these are my orders
i am to nail up the coffin
at eleveno'clock exactly i am to be in the chapel
the mother present orc will be there
mother ascension will be there
two men would be better
however nevermind
i shall have my lever
we will open the vault we will lower the coffin and we will close the vault again
after which there will be no trace of anything
the government will have no suspicion
thus all has been arranged reverend mother
no
what else remains
the empty coffin remains
this produced a pause
gauche le vent meditated
the prioress meditated
what is to be done with that coffin father day vent
it will be given to the earth
empty
another silence
gauche le vent made with his left hand that sort of a gesture which dismisses a troublesome subject
reverend mother i am the one who is to nail up the coffin in the basement of the church and no one can enter there but myself and i will cover the coffin with the pall
yes but the bearers when they place it in the hearse and lower it into the grave will be sure to feel that there is nothing in it
ah
these
exclaimed gauche le vent
the prioress began to make the sign of the cross and looked fixedly at the gardener
the vip stuck fast in his throat
he made haste to improvise an expedient to make her forget the oath
i will put earth in the coffin reverend mother
that will produce the effect of a corpse
you are right
earth that is the same thing as man
so you will manage the empty coffin
i will make that my special business
the prior esa's face up to that moment troubled and clouded grew serene once more
she made the sign in a superior dismissing an inferior to him
gauche l event went towards the door
as he was on the point of passing out the prior was raised her voice gently i am pleased with you father day vent bring your brother to me tomorrow after the burial and tell him to fetch his daughter
chapter iv in which jean valjean has quite the air of having read austin castille highest rides of a lame man are like the ogling glances of a one eyed man they do not reach their goal very promptly
moreover gauche l event was in a dilemma
he took nearly a quarter of an hour to return to his cottage in the garden
cosette had wakes up
jean valjean had placed her near the fire
at the moment when gauche le vent entered jean valjean was pointing out to her the vintner's basket on the wall and saying to her listen attentively to me my little cosette
we must go away from this house but we shall return to it and we shall be very happy here
the good man who lives here is going to carry you off on his back in that
you will wait for me at a lady's house
i shall come to fetch you
obey and say nothing above all things unless you want madame the barrier to get you again
cosette nodded gravely
jean valjean turned round at the noise made by gauche le vent opening the door
well
everything is arranged and nothing is said gauche i event
i have permission to bring you in but before bringing you in you must be got out
that's where the difficulty lies
it is easy enough with the child
you will carry her out
and she will hold her tongue
i answer for that
but you father madeleine
and after a silence fraught with anxiety faith el event exclaimed why get out as you came in
jean valjean as in the first instance contented himself with saying impossible
rauch eleventh rumbled more to himself than to jean valjean there is another thing which bothers me
i have said that i would put earth unit
when i come to think it over the earth instead of the corpse will not seem like the real thing itwon't do it will get displaced it will move about
the men will bear it
you understand father madeleine the government will notice it
jean valjean shared him straight in the eye and thought that he was raving
gauche l event went on how the deuce are you going to get out
it must all be done by tomorrow morning
it is tomorrow that i am to bring you in
the prioress expects you
then he explained to jean valjean that this was his recompense for a service which yet such el event was to render to the community
that it fell among his duties to take part in their burials that he failed up the coffins and helped the grave digger at the cemetery
that the nun who had died that morning had requested to be buried in the coffin which had served her for a bed and interred in the vault under the altar of the chapel
that the police regulations for bare this but that she was one of those dead to whom nothing is refused
that the prioress and the vocal mother's intended to fulfil the wish if the deceased
that it was so much the worse for the government
that he rauch fl event was to nail up the coffin in the cell raise the stone in the chapel and lower the corpse into the vault
and that by way of thanks the prioress was to admit his brother to the house as a gardener and his niece as a pupil
that his brother each
madeleine and that his niece was cosette
that the prioress had told him to bring his brother on the following evening after the counterfeit interment in the cemetery
but that he could not bring m
madeleine in from the outside of m
madeleine was not outside
that that was the first problem
and then that there was another the empty coffin
what is that empty coffin
asked jean valjean
gauche legend replied the coffin of the administration
what coffin
what administration
an undies
the municipal doctor comes and says' a bug has died
' the government sends a coffin
the next day it sends a hearse and undertaker's men to get the coffin and carry it to the cemetery
the undertaker's men will come and lift the coffin there will be nothing in it
put something in it
a corpse
i have none
no
what then
a living person
what person
me
said jean valjean
rauch elec eng who was seated sprang up as though a bomb had burst under his chair
you
why not
jean valjean gave way to one of those rare smiles which lighted up his face like a flash from heaven in the winter
you know gauche le vent what you have said' nother crucifixion is dead
' and i add' and father madeleine is buried
' ah
good you can laugh you are not speaking seriously
very seriously i must get out of this place
certainly
i have told you to find a basket and a cover for me also
well
the basket will be of pune and the cover a black cloth
in the first place it will be a white cloth
guns are buried in white
let it be a white cloth then
you are not like other men father madeleine
to behold such devices which are nothing else than the savage and daring inventions of the galleys spring forth from the peaceable things which surrounded him and mingle with what he called the petty course of life in the convent caused gauche le vent as much amazement as a full fishing in the gutter of the rue saint denis would inspire in a passerby
jean valjean went on the problem is to get out of here without being seen
this offers the means
but give me some information in the first place
how is it manager
where is this coffin
the empty one
yes
downstairs in what is called the read room
it stands on two trestles under the pall
how long is the coffin
six feet
what is this dead room
it is a chamber on the ground floor which has a grated window opening on the garden which is closed on the outside by a shutter and two doors one leads into the convent the other into the church
what church
the church in the street the church which anyone can enter
have you the keys to those two doors
no i have the key to the door which communicates with the convent the porter has the key to the door which communicates with the church
when does the porter open that door
only to allow the undertaker's men to enter when they come to get the coffin
when the coffin has been taken out the door is closed again
who nails up the coffin
i do
who spreads the pall over it
ico
are you alone
not another man except the police doctor can enter the dead room
that is even written on the wall
would you miss me in that room tonight when everyone is asleep
no
but i could give you in a small dark book which opens on the dead room where i keep my tools to use for burials and of which i have the key
at what time will the hearse come for the coffin tomorrow
about threeo'clock in the afternoon
the burial will take place at the day girard cemetery a little before nightfall
it is not very near
i will remain concealed in your tool closet all night and all the morning
and how about food
i shall be hungry
i will bring you something
you can come and mail me up in the coffin at twoo'clock
gauche le centre coiled and cracked his finger joints
but that is impossible
bah
impossible to take a hammer and drive some nails in a plank
what seemed uk press den rest of aus bel events as we repeat a simple matter to jean valjean
jean valjean had been in worse straits than this
any man who has been a prisoner understands how to contract himself to fit the diameter of the escape
the prisoner is subject to flight as the sick man is subject to a crisis which saves or kills him
an escape is a cure
what does not a man undergo for the wake of a cure
to have himself mailed upon a case and carried off like a half of goods to live for a long time in a box to find wir where there is gone to economize his breath for hours to know how to stifle without dying this was one of jean valjean's gloomy talents
moreover a coffin containing a living being that convict's expedient is also an imperial expedient
if we are to credit the monk austin castille jo this was the means employed by charles the fifth desirous of seeing the pooh bear or the last time after his abdication
he had her brought into and carried out of the monastery of saint juste in this manner
gauche le vent who had recovered himself a little exclaimed but how will you manage to breathe
i will breathe
in that box
the mere thought of it suffocates me
you surely must have a gimlet you will make a few holes here and there around my mouth and you will nail the top plank on loosely
good
and what if you should happen to cough or to sneeze
a man who is making his escape does not cough or sneeze
and jean valjean added father gauche le vent we must come to a decision i must either be caught here or accept this escape through the hearse
everyone has noticed the taste which cats have for pausing and lounging between the two leaves of a half shut door
who is there who has not said to a cst do come in
there are men who when an incident stands half open before them have the same tendency to halt in on decision between two resolutions at the risk of getting crushed through the abrupt closing of the adventure by date
the over prudent data as they are and because they are cats sometimes incur more danger than the audacious
gauche l event was of this hesitating nature
but jean valjean's coolness prevailed over him in spite of himself
he grumbled well since there is no other means
jean valjean resumed the only thing which troubles me is what will take place at the cemetery
that is the very point that is not troublesome exclaimed gauche le vent
if you are sure of coming out of the coffin all right i am sure of getting you out of the grave
the grave digger is a drunkard and a friend of mine
he is rather ms etienne
an old fellow of the old school
the grave digger puts the corpses in the grave and i put the grave digger in my pocket
i will tell you what will take place
they will arrive a little before dusk three quarters of an hour before the gates of the cemetery are closed
the hearse will drive directly up to the grave
i shall follow that is my business
i shall have a hammer a chisel and some pincers in my pocket
the hearse halts the undertaker's menu not a rope around your coffin and lower your own
the priest says the prayers makes the sign of the cross sprinkles the holy water and takes his departure
i am left alone with father me etienne
he is my friend i tell you
one of two things will happen he will either be sober or he will not be sober
if he is not drunk i shall say to him' come and drink about while the non doing the good quince is open
' i carry him off i get him drunk it does not take long to make father me etienne drunk he always has the beginning of it about him i lay him under the table i take his card so that i can get into the cemetery again and i return without him
then you have no longer anyone but me to deal with
if he is drunk i shall say to him've off i will do your work for you
' of the gods and i drag you out of the hole
jean valjean held out his hand and gauche le vent precipitated himself upon it with the touching effusion of a peasant
that is settled father gauche le vent
all will go well
provided nothing goes wrong thought faux tel event
in that case it would be terrible
chapter v it is not necessary to be drunk in order to be immortal on the following day as the sun was declining the very rare passersby on the boulevard du maine pulled off their hats to an old fashioned hearse ornamented with skills cross bones and tears
this hearse contained a coffin covered with a white cloth over which spread a large black cross like a huge corpse with dropping arms
a mourning coach in which could be seen a priest in his surplice and a choir boy in his red cap followed
two undertaker's men in gray uniforms trimmed with black walked on the right and the left of the hearse
behind it came an old man in the garments of a laborer who limped along
the procession was going in the direction of the day girard cemetery
the handle of a hammer the blade of a cold chisel and the antennae of a pair of pincers were visible protruding from the man's pocket
gnd day girard cemetery formed an exception among the cemeteries of paris
it had its peculiar usage's just as it had its carriage entrance and it's house door which old people in the quarter who cling tenaciously to ancient words still called the ports cavaliers and the ports pie tonne
the bernardine's benedictines of the rue petit pic pic had obtained permission as we have already stated to be buried there in a corner apart and at night the plot of land having formerly belonged to their community
the grave digger's being thus bound to service on the evening in summer and at night in winter in this cemetery they were subjected to a special discipline
the gates of the paris cemeteries closed at that epoch at sundown and this being a municipal regulation the day girard cemetery was bound by it like the rest
the carriage gate and the house door were two contiguous grayed gates adjoining a pavilion built by the architect petri net and inhabited by the door keeper of the cemetery
these gates the record swung inexorably in their hinges at the instant when the sun disappeared behind the time of the invalides
if any grave digger were delayed after that moment in the cemetery there was but one way for him to get out his grave digger's card furnished by the department of public funerals
a sort of letterbox was constructed in the porter's window
the grave digger dropped his card into this box the porter heard it fall pulled the rope and the small door opened
if the man had not his card he mentioned his name the porter who was sometimes in bed and asleep rose came out and identified the man and opened the gate with his key the grave digger stepped out but had to pay a fine of fifteen france
this cemetery with its peculiarities outside the regulations embarrassed the symmetry of the administration
it was suppressed a little later than
the cemetery of montparnasse called the eastern cemetery succeeded to it and inherited that famous dram shop next to the day girard cemetery which was surmounted by a quince painted on a board and which formed an angle one side on the drinkers' tables and the other on the tombs with this sign au bon doing
the day girard cemetery was what may be called a faced cemetery
it was falling into disuse
dampness was invading of the flowers were deserting it
the bourgeois did not care much about being buried in the day girard it hinted at poverty
pere lachaise if you please
to be buried in pere lachaise is equivalent to having furniture in mahogany
it is recognized as elegant
the day girard cemetery was a venerable enclosure planted like an old fashioned french garden
straight alleys boat buy a trees holly ancient tombs beneath aged cypress trees and very tall grass
in the evening it was tragic there
there were very lugubrious lines about it
the sun had not yet set when the hearse with the white oakland the black cross entered the avenue of the day girard cemetery
the lame man who followed it was no other than gauche levene
the interment of mother crucifixion in the vault under the altar the editor cosette the introduction of jean valjean to the dead room all had been executed without difficulty and there had been no hitch
let us remark in passing that the burial of mother crucifixion under the altar of the convent is a perfectly denial offence in our sight
it is one of the faults which resemble a duty
the nuns had committed it not only without difficulty but even with the applause of their own consciences
in the cloister what is called the government is only an inter meddling with authority an interference which is always questionable
in the first place the rule as for the code we shall see
name as many laws as you please men but keep them for yourselves
the tribute to caesar is never anything but the remnants of the tribute to god
a prince is nothing in the presence of a principle
faux tel event limped along behind the hearse in a very contented frame of mind
his twin plots the one with the nuns the one for the convent the other against it the other with m
madeleine had succeeded to all appearance
jean valjean's composure was one of those powerful tranquil pities which are contagious
gauche legend no longer felt doubtful as to his success
what remained to be done was a mere nothing
within the last two years he had made good father me etienne a chubby cheeked person drunk at least ten times
he played with father me etienne
he did what he liked with him
he made him dance according to miss him
m estienne's head adjusted itself to the cap off such elegant's will
gauche le vent's confidence was perfect
at the moment when the convoy entered the avenue leading to the cemetery rauch eleventh landed cheerfully at the hearse and said half a loud as he rubbed his big hands here's a fine farce
all at once the hearse halted it had reached the gate
the permission for interment must be exhibited
the undertaker's msn addressed himself to the porter of the cemetery
during this colloquy which always is productive of a delay or from one to two minutes someone a stranger came and placed himself behind the hearse beside gauche le vent
he was a sort of laboring man who wore a waistcoat with large pockets and carried a mattock under his arm
gauche le vent surveyed this stranger
who are you
he demanded
the man replied the grave digger
if a man could survive the flow of a cannonball dull in the breast he would make the same face that gauche p event made
the grave digger
yes
you
i
far terms etienne is the grave digger
he was
what
he was
he is dead
f auch so event had expected anything but this that a grave digger could die
it is true nevertheless that grave digger sep die themselves
by dint of excavating graves for other people one hollows out one's own
gauche le vent stood there with his mouth wide open
he had hardly the strength to stammer but it is not possible
it is so
but he persisted feebly father me etienne is the grave digger
after napoleon louis xviii
after me etienne grobler
peasant my name is bribie r
faux held vent who was deadly pale stared at this fri hier
he was at all think i did utterly tune real man
he had the air of an unsuccessful doctor who had turned grave digger
gauche le vent burst out laughing
ah
said he what queer things do happen
father me etienne is dead but long live little father lenoir
do you know who little rather lenoir is
he is a jug of red wine
it is a bug of sirens korn iron
of real paris eugene
ah
coolfm estienne is dead
i am sorry for it he was a jolly fellow
but you are a jolly fellow tom
are you not comrade
we'll go and gave a drink together presently
the man replied i have been a student
i passed my fourth examination
i never drink
the hearse had set out again and was rolling up the grand alley of the cemetery
rauch eleventh as slackened his pace
he linked more out of anxiety than from infirmity
the grave digger walked on in front of him
gauche le vent passed the unexpected grobler once more in review
he was one of those men who though very young have the air of age and who though slender are extremely strong
comrade
cried gauche le vent
the man turned round
i am the convent grave digger
my colleague said the man
gauche le vent who was illiterate but very sharp understood that he had to deal with a formidable species of man with a fine talker
he muttered's leather me etienne is dead
the man replied completely
the good god consulted his notebook which shows when the time is up
it was father me etienne's turn
father me etienne died
gauche le vent repeated mechanically the good for the good god said the man authoritatively
according to the philosophers the eternal father according to the jacobins the supreme being
shall we got make each other's acquaintance
stammered gauche le vent
it is made
you are a peasant i am a parisian
people do not know each other until they have drunk together
he who emptied his glass emptied his heart
you must come and have a drink with me
such a thing can not be refused
business first
rauch do event thought i am post
they were only a few turns if the wheel distant from the small alley or a diff to the nuns' corner
the grave digger resumed peasant i have seven small children who must be fed
as they must say i can not drink
and he added with the satisfaction of a serious man who is turning a phrase sell their hunger is the enemy of my thirst
the hearse skirted a clump of cypress trees skirted the grand alley turned into a narrow one entered the wasteland and plunged into a thicket
this indicates the immediate proximity of the place of seoul ture
faux nel event slackened his pace but he could not detain the hearse
fortunately the soil which was light and wet with the winter rains clogged the wheels and retarded its speed
he approached the grave digger
they have such a nice little argenteuil wine murmured gauche le vent
villager retorted the man i ought not be a grave digger
my father was a porter at theory tan dun town hall
he destined me for literature
but he had reversed
he had losses on' change
i was obliged to renounce the profession of author
but i am still a public writer
so you are not a grave digger then
returned gauche le vent clutching at this branch feeble as it was
the one does not hinder the other
i cumulate
gauche le vent did not understand this last word
some have a drink said he
here are mark becomes necessary
gauche le vent whatever his anguish offered a drink but he did not explain himself on one point who was to pay
generally days nfl event offered and father me etienne paid
an offer of a drink was the evident result of the novel situation created by the new grave digger and it was necessary to make this offer but the old gardener left the proverbial quarter of an hour named after rabelais in the dark and that not unintentionally
as for himself gauche le vent did not wish to pay troubled as he was
the grave digger went on with a superior smile one must eat
i have accepted father me etienne's reversion
one gets to be a philosopher when one has nearly completed his classes
to the labor of the hand i join the labor of the arm
i have my scrivener's stall in the market of the rue de sevres
you know
the umbrella market
all the cooks of the red cross apply to me
i scribble their declarations of love to the raw soldiers
in the morning i write love letters in the evening i dig graves
such is life rustic
the hearse was still advancing
rauch eleven run easy to the last degree was gazing about him on all sides
great drops of perspiration trickled down from his brow
but continued the grave digger a man can not serve two mistresses
i must choose between the pen and the martock
the mattock is ruining my hand
the hearse halted
the choirboys light ex from the mourning coach then the priest
one of the small front wheels of the hearse had run up a little on a pile of earth beyond which an open grave was visible
what a farce this is
repeated gauche le vent in consternation
chapter vi between four planks who was in the coffin
the reader knows
jean valjean
jean valjean had arranged things so that he could exist there and he could almost breathe
it is a strange thing to what are free security of conscience confers security of the rest
every combination thought out by jean valjean had been progress ing and progressing favorably since the preceding day
he liked such el event counted on father me etienne
he had no doubt as to the end
never was there a more critical situation never more complete composure
the four planks of the coffin breathe out a kind of terrible peace
it seemed as though something of the repose of the dead entered into jean valjean's tranquillity
from the depths of that coffin he had been able to follow and he had followed all the phases of the terrible drama which he was playing with death
shortly after rauch elegant had finished mailing of the upper plank jean valjean had felt himself carried out then driven off
he knew from the diminution in the jolting when they left the pavements and reached the earth road
he had divined from a full noise that they were crossing the bridge of austerlitz
at the first half he had understood that they were entering the cemetery at the second half he said to himself here is the grave
suddenly he felt hands seize the coffin then a harsh grating against the plank she explained it to himself as the ripe which was being fastened round the casket in order to lower it into the cavity
then he experienced a giddiness
the undertaker's man and the grave digger had probably allowed the coffin to lose its balance and had lowered the head before the root
he recovered himself fully when he felt himself horizontal and motionless
he had just touched the bottom
he had a certain sensation of cold
a voice rose above him glacial and solemn
he heard latin words which he did not understand pass over him so slowly that he was able to catch the gone by one quid or mount on terra ep hovered vigil a fungal ii invita master name talli in approve i unit view any semper
a child's voice said de profundis
the grave voice began again requiem after name on as i do mine
the child's voice response degli a perpetual us datei
he heard something like the gentle latter of several drops of rain on the plank which covered him
it was probably the holy water
he thought this will be over soon now
patience for a little while longer
the priest will take his departure
gauche l event will take me etienne off to drink
i shall be left
the new uchel event will return alone and i shall get out
that will be the work of a good hour
the grave voice resumed requir scat in pace
and the child's voice said amen
jean valjean strained his ears and heard something like retreating footsteps
there they are going now though the
i am alone
all at once he heard over his head a sound which seemed to him to be a flap of thunder
it was a shovel ful of earth falling in the coffin
a second shovel gulf ell
one of the holes through which he breathed had just been stopped up
a third shovel ful of earth fell
then a fourth
there are things which are too strong for the strongest man
jean valjean lost consciousness
chapter vii in which will be found the origin of the sayingdon't lose the card this is what had taken place above the coffin in which lay jean valjean
when the hearse had driven off when the priest and the choir boy had entered the carriage again and taken their departure gauche le vent who had not taken his eyes from the grave digger saw the latter bend over and grasp his shovel which was sticking up right in the heap of dirt
the new uchel event took a supreme resolve
he placed himself between the grave and the grave digger crossed his arms and said i am the one to pay
the grave digger stared at him in amazement and replied what's that peasant
gauche le vent repeated i am the one who pays
what
for the wine
what wine
that argenteuil find
where is the argenteuil
at the non doing
go to the devil
said the grave digger
and he flung a shovel ful of earth on the coffin
the coffin gave back a hollow sound
gauche le vent felt himself stagger and on the point of falling headlong into the grave himself
he shouted in a voice in which the strangling sound of the death rattle began to mingle comrade
before the non doing is shut
the grave digger took some more earth on his shovel
gauche le vent continued
i will pay
and he seized the man's arm
listen to me comrade
i am the convent grave digger i have come to help you
it is a business which can be performed at night
let us begin them by going for a drink
and as he spoke and clung to this desperate insistence this melancholy reflection occurred to him and if he drinks will he get drunk
provincial said the man if you positively insist upon it i consent
we will drink
after work never before
and he flourished his shovel briskly
f sichel event held him back
it is argenteuil wine at six
oh come said the grave digger you are a bell ringer
ding ding ding dong that's all you know how to say
go hang yourself
and he threw in a second shovel ful
eau che le vent had reached a point where he no longer knew what he was saying
come along and drink he cried since it is i who lays the bill
when we have put the child to bed said the grave digger
he flung in a third shovel ful
then he thrust his shovel into the earth and added it's cold tonight houses and the corpse would shriek out after us if we were to plant her there without a coverlet
at that moment as he loaded his shovel the grave digger bent over and the pocket of his waistcoat gaped
gauche i event's wild haze fell mechanically into that pocket and there it stopped
the sun was not yet hidden behind the horizon there was still light enough to enable him to distinguish something white at the bottom of that yawning pocket
the sum total of lightning that the eye of a picard peasant can contain traversed gauche le vent's pupils
an idea had just occurred to him
he thrust his hand into the pocket from behind without the grave digger who was wholly absorbed in his shovel ful of earth observing it and pulled out the white object which lay at the bottom of it
the man sent a fourth a novel ful tumbling into the grave
just as he turned round to get the fifth day che le vent looked calmly at him and said by the way you newman have you your card
the grave digger paused
what card
the sun is on the point of setting
that's good it is going to put on its nightcap
the gate of the cemetery will close immediately
well what then
have you your card
ah
my card
said the trade digger
and he fumbled in his pocket
having searched one pocket he proceeded to search the other
he passed onto his fond explored the first returned to the second
why no. said he i have not my card
i must have forgotten it
fifteen brands fine said rauch fl event
the grave digger turned green
green is the pallor of lucid people
ah
jesus mon dieu bancroft ea has la lune
he exclaimed
fifteen france fine
three pieces of a hundred so he said gauche p event
the grave digger dropped his shovel
gauche le vent's turn had come
at come now conscripts side such eleventh one of this despair
there is no question of committing suicide and benefiting the grace
fifteen francais fifteen france and besides you may not be able to pay it
i am an old hand you are a new one
i know all the ropes and the devices
i will give you some friendly advice
one thing is clear the sun is on the point of setting it is touching the somehow the cemetery will be closed in five minutes more
that is true replied the man
five minutes more and you will not have time to fill the grave it is a ship low as the devil this grave and to reach the gate in season to pass it before it is shut
that is true
in that case a fine of fifteen france
fifteen francs
but you have time
where do you live
a couple of steps from the barrier a quarter of an hour from here
no
the decay girard
you have just time to get out by taking to your heels at your best speed
that is exactly so
once outside the gate you gallop home you get your card you return the cemetery porter admits you
as you have your cart there will be nothing to lay
and you will bury your corpse
i'll watch it for you in the meantime so that it shall not run away
i am indebted to you for my life peasant
de camp
said caucus levert
the grave digger overwhelm dd with gratitude shook his hand and set off on a fun
when the man had disappeared in the thicket day che le vent listened until he heard his footsteps die away in the distance then he leaned over the grave and said in a low tone father madeleine
there was no reply
gauche l event was seized with a shudder
he fumbled rather than climbed into the grave flung himself on the head of the coffin and cried are you there
silence in the coffin
gauche le vent hardly able to draw his breath for trembling seized his cold chisel and his hammer and pride up the coffin lid
jean valjean's face appeared in the twilight it was pale and his eyes were closed
fao che le vent's hair rose up right on his head he sprang to his feet then fell back against the side of the grave ready to swoon on the coffin
he stared at jean valjean
jean valjean lay there pallid and motionless
gauche le vent murmured in a voice as faint as a sigh he is dead
and drawing himself up and folding his arms with such violence that his clenched fists came in contact with his shoulder she cried and this is the way i save his life
then the poor man fell to sobbing
if so lilo quizes the while for it is an error to suppose that the soliloquy is unnatural
powerful emotion often talks aloud
it is rather k estienne's fault
why did that fool die
what needs as there for him to give up the ghost at the very moment when no one was expecting it
it is he who has killed m
madeleine
father madeleine
he is in the coffin
it is quite handy
all is over
now is there any sense in these things
ah
my god
he is dead
well
and his little girl what ami to do with her
what will the fruit seller say
the idea of its being possible for a man like that to die like this
when i think how he put himself under that cart
father madeleine
father madeleine
parfume
he was suffocated i said so
bewouldn't believe me
well
here's a pretty trick to play
he is dead that goodman the very best man out of all the good god's good folks
and his little girl
ah
in the first place idon't go back there myself
i shall stay here
after having some such a thing as that
what's the use of being two old men if we are two old tools
but in the first place how did he manage to enter the consent
that was the beginning of it all
one should not do such things
father madeleine
father madeleine
rather madeleine
madeleine
monsieur madeleine
monsieur lemaire
he does not hear me
now get out of this scrape if you can
and he tore his hair
a grating sound became audible through the trees in the distance
it was the cemetery gate closing
rauch elegant bent over jean valjean and all at once he bounced back and recoiled so far as the limits of a grave permit
jean valjean's eyes were open and gazing at him
to see a corpse is alarming to behold a resurrection is almost as much so
gauche le vent became limestone pale haggard overwhelmed by all these excesses of emotion not knowing whether he had to do with a living major area done and staring at jean valjean who was gazing at him
illustration the resurrection b resurrection i fell asleep said jean valjean
and he raised himself to a sitting posture
gauche le vent fell on his knees
just good virgin
how you frightened me
then he sprang to his feet and cried thanks father madeleine
jean valjean had merely tainted
the fresh air has revived him
joy is the ebb of terror
gauche le vent found almost as much difficulty in recovering himself as jean valjean had
so you are not dead
oh
how wise you are
i called you so much that you came back
when i saw your eyes shut i said' good
there he is stifled' i should have gone raving mad mad enough for a straitjacket
they would have put me in nice tre
what do you suppose i should have done if you had been dead
and your little girl
there's that fruit sellers he would never have understood in
the child is thrust into your arms and then the grandfather is dead
what a story
good saints of paradise what's tale
ah
you are alive that's the best of it
i am cold said jean valjean
this remark recalled gauche le vent thoroughly to reality and there was pressing need of it
the souls of these two men were troubled even when they had recovered themselves although they did not realize it and there was about them something uncanny which was the sinister bewilderment inspired by the place
let us get out of here quickly exclaimed gauche le vent
he fumbled in his pocket and pulled out a route with which he had provided himself
but first take a drop said he
the flask finished what the fresh air had begun jean valjean swallowed a mouthful of brandy and regained full possession of his faculties
he got out of the coffin and helped ca uchel event to nail on the kid again
three minutes later they were out of the grave
moreover gauche l event was perfectly composed
he took his time
the cemetery was closed
the arrival of the grave digger grobler was not to be apprehended
that conscript was at home busily engaged in looking for his card and at some difficulty in finding it in his lodgings since its a sind auch so event's pocket
without a card he could not get back into the cemetery
gauche l event took the shovel and jean valjean the pickaxe and together they buried the empty coffin
when the grave was full gauche le vent said to jean valjean let us to
i will keep the shovel do you carry off the martock
night was falling
jean valjean experienced done difficulty in moving and in walking
he had stiffened himself in that coffin and had become a little like a corpse
the rigidity of death had seized upon him between those four planks
he had in a manner to thaw out from the tomb
you are bw number said gauche le vent
it is a pity that i have a game left or otherwise we might step out briskly
bah
replies jean valjean four paces will put life into my legs once more
they set off by the alleys through which the hearse had passed
on arriving before the closed gate and the porter's pavilion gauche le vent who held the grave digger's card in his hand dropped it into the box the porter pulled the rope the gate opener and they went out
how well everything is going
said caucus le vent what a capital idea that was of your weather madeleine
they passed the day girard barrier in the simplest manner in the world
in the neighborhood of the cemetery a shovel and pick are equal to two passports
fiery ebay girard was deserted
father madeleine said rauch eleven has they went along and raising his eyes to the houses your eyes are better than mine
show me no
here it is said jean valjean
there is no one in the street said gauche le vent
give me your mattock and wait a couple of minutes for me
gauche le vent entered no
ascended to the very tip guided by the instinct which always leads the poor man to the target and knocked in the dark at the door of an attic
a voice replied come in
it was grobler's voice
gauche le vent opened the door
the grave digger's dwelling was like all such wretched habitations an unfurnished and encumbered garret
a packing case a coffin perhaps took the place of a commodes butter pot served for a drinking fountain a straw mattress served for a bed the floor served instead of tables and chairs
in a corner on a tattered fragment which had been a piece of an old carpet a thin woman and a number of children were piled in a heap
the whole of this poverty stricken interior bore traces of having been overturned
one would have said that there had been an earthquake for one
the covers were displaced the rags scattered about the jun broken the mother had been crying the children had probably been beaten traces of a vigorous and i'll tempered search
it was plain that the grave digger had made a desperate search for his card and had made everybody in the garret from them unto his wife responsible for its loss
he wore an air of desperation
but gauche l event was in too great a hurry to terminate this adventure to take any notice of this sad side of his success
he entered and said i have brought you back your shovel and pick
grobler gazed at him in style faction
is if you peasant
and tomorrow morning you will find your card with the porter of the cemetery
and he laid the shovel and mattock on the floor
what is the meaning of this
demanded grobler
the meaning of it is that you dropped your card out of your pocket that i found it on the ground after you were gone that i have buried the corpse that i have filled the grave that i have done your work that the porter will return your card to you and that you will not have to pay fifteen france
there you have it conscript
thanks villager
exclaimed grobler radiant
the next time i will pay for the drinks
chapter viii a successful interrogatory an hour later in the darkness of night two men and a child presented themselves at no
the petit lisp us
the elder of the men lifted the knocker and rapped
they were gauche le vent jean valjean and rosette
the two old men had gone to fetch cosette from the fruit fred's on the rue du chem invert where rauch eleventh as deposited her on the preceding day
cosette had passed these twenty four hours trembling silently and understanding nothing
she trembled to such a degree that she wept
she had neither eaten not slept
the worthy fruit seller has plied her with a hundred questions without obtaining any other reply than a melancholy and unvarying gaze
cosette had betrayed nothing of what she had seen and heard during the last two days
she divined that they were passing through a crisis
she was deeply conscious that it was necessary to be good
who has not experienced the sovereign power of those two words pronounced with a certain accent in the war of a terrified little being say nothing
fear is mute
moreover no one guards a secret like a child
but when at the expiration of these lugubrious twenty four hours she beheld jean valjean again she gave vent to such a cry of joy that any thoughtful person who had chances to hear that cry would have guessed that it issued from an abyss
gauche k event belonged to the convent and knew the passwords
all the doors opened
this was solved the double and alarming problem of how to get out and how to get in
the porter who had received his instructions opened the life is servant's door which connected the courtyard with the garden and which could still be seen from the street twenty years ago in the wall at the bottom of the court which faced the carriage entrance
the porter admitted all three of them through this door and from that point they reached the inner reserved parlor where gauche k event on the preceding day had received his orders from the prioress
the prioress rosary in hand was waiting for them
a vocal mother with her veil powered stood beside her
a discreet candlelight ed one might almost say made a show if lighting the parlor
the prior was passed jean valjean in review
there is nothing which examines like a downcast eye
then she questioned him you are the brother
yes reverend mother replied faith eleven t
what is your name
faux nel event replied ultime gauche le vent
he really had had a brother named ultime who was dead
where do you come from
gauche le vent replied from pic quinny near amiens
what is your age
gauche le vent replied fifty
what is your profession
gauche le vent replied gardener
are you a good christian
gauche le vent replied everyone is in the family
is this your little girl
gauche k event replied yes reverend mother
you are her father
gauche p event replied her grandfather
the focal mother said to the prioress in a low voice he answers well
jean valjean had not uttered a single word
the prioress looked attentively at cosette and said half aloud to the vocal mother she will grow up ugly
the two mothers consulted for a few moments in very low tones in the corner of the parlor then the prioress turned round and said father day vent you will get another knee cap with a bell
two will be re qui red now
on the following day therefore two bells were audible in the garden and the nuns could not resist the temptation to raise the corner of their grils
at the extreme end of the garden under the trees two men eau vent and another man were visible as they dug side by side
an enormous event
their silence was broken to the extent of saying to each other he is an assistant gardener
the vocal mothers added he is a brother of father day vent
jean valjean was in fact regularly installed he had his belief kneecap henceforth he was official
his name was ultime gauche le vent
the most powerful determining cause of his admission had been the prioress's observation upon cosette she will grow up ugly
the prioress that pronounced prognostic at or immediately took a fancy to cosette and gave her a place in the school as a charity pupil
there is nothing that is not strictly logical about this
it is in vain that mirrors are banished from the convent women are conscious of their faces now girls who are conscious of their beauty do not easily become nuns the vocation being voluntary in inverse proportion to their good looks more is to be hoped from the ugly than from the pretty
hence a lively taste for plain girls
the whole of this adventure increased the impl france of good old rauch eleven the win a triple success in the eyes of jean valjean whom he had saved and sheltered in those of grave digger grobler who said to himself he spared me that come with the convent which being enabled thanks to him to retain the coffin of mother crucifixion under the altar elided caesar and satisfied god
there was a coffin containing a body in the petit pi cpus amd a coffin without a body in the day girard cemetery public order had no doubt been deeply disturbed thereby fit no one was aware of it
as for the convent its gratitude for such el event was very great
ca uchel event became the best of se editors and the most precious of gardeners
upon the occasion of the archbishop's next visit the prioress recounted the affair to his grace making something of a confession at the same time and yet boasting of her feed
on leaving the convent the archbishop mentioned it with approval and in a whisper tom
felatio monsieur's confessor afterwards archbishop of reims and cardinal
this admiration for faux held bang became widespread for it made its way to rome
we have seen a note addressed by the then reigning pope leo xii
to one of his relatives a monsignor in the nuncio's establishment in paris and bearing like himself the name of dell agents it contained these lines it appears that there is in a convent in paris an excellent gardener who is also a holy man naked gay vent
nothing of this triumph reached gauche le vent in his but he went on grafting weeding and covering up his melon beds with out in the least suspect in this excellences and his sanctity
neither did he suspect his glory any more than a durham of surrey full whose portrait is published in the london illustrated news with this inscription bill which carried off the prize at the cattle show
chapter ix cloistered cosette continued to hold her tongue in the convent
it was quite natural that cosette should think herself jean valjean's daughter
moreover as she knew nothing she could say nothing and then she would not have said anything in any case
as we have just observed nothing trains children to silence like unhappiness
cosette had suffered so much that she feared everything even to speak or to breathe
a single word had so often brought down an avalanche upon her
she had hardly begun to regain her confidence since she had been with jean valjean
she speedily became accustomed to the convent
only she regretted catherine but she dared not say so
once however she did say to jean valjean father if i had known i would have brought her away with me
cosette had been obliged on becoming a scholar in the convent to won the garb of the pupils of the house
jean valjean succeeded in getting them to restore to him the garments which she laid aside
this was the same mourning suit which he had made her put on when she had quitted the the barriers' inn
it was not very threadbare even now
jean valjean locked up these garments plus the stockings and the shoes with a quantity of camphor and all the aromatics in which convents abound in a little valise which he found means of procuring
he set this valise on a chair near his bed and he always carried the key about his person
father cosette asked him one day what is there in that box which smells so good
father fw uchel event received other recompense for his good action in addition to the glory which we just mentioned and of which he knew nothing in the first place it made him happy next he had much less work since it was shared
lastly as he was very fond of snuff he found the presence of m
madeleine an advantage in that he used three times as much as he had done previously and that in an infinitely more luxurious manner seeing that m
madeleine paid for it
the nuns did not adopt the name of ultime they called jean valjean the other day vent
if these holy women had possessed anything of javert's glance they would eventually have noticed that when there was any errand to be done outside in the behalf of the garden it was always the elder gauche levent the old the inform the lame man who went and never the other but whether it is that russ constantly fixed on god know not how to spy or whether they were by preference occupied in keeping watch on each other they paid no need to this
moreover it was well for jean valjean that he kept close and did not stir out
javert watched the quarter for more than a month
this convent was for jean valjean like an island surrounded by rules
henceforth those four walls constituted his world
he saw enough of the sky there to enable him to preserve his serenity and cosette enough to remain happy
a very sweet life began for him
he inhabited the old but at the end of the garden in company with gauche le vent
this novel built of old rubbish which was still in existence in was composed as the reader already knows of three chambers all of which were utterly rare and had nothing beyond the walls
the principal one had been given up by force for jean valjean had opposed it in vain tom
madeleine by father gauche le vent
the walls of this chamber had for ornament in addition to the two nailed here on to hang the kneecap and the baskets royalist banknote of' applied to the wall over the chimney piece and of which the following is an exact facsimile illustration royalist banknote b banknote this specimen orden de an paper money had been nailed to the wall by the preceding gardener an old chou an who had died in the convent and whose place gauche le vent had taken
jean valjean worked on the garden every day and made himself very useful
he had formerly been a primer of trees and he gladly found himself a gardener once more
it will be remembered that he knew all sorts of secrets and receipts for agriculture
he turned these to advantage
almost all the trees in the orchard were in grafted and wild
he budded them and made them produce excellent fruit
cosette had permission to pass an hour with him every day
as the sisters were melancholy and he was kind the child made comparisons and adored him
at the appointed hour she flew to the hut
when she entered the lowly cabins be filled it with paradise
jean valjean blossomed out and felt his happiness increase with the happiness which he afforded cosette
the joy which we inspire has this charming property that far from growing meager like all reflections it returns to us more radiant than ever
at recreation hours jean valjean watched her running and playing in the distance and he distinguished her laugh from that of the best
for cosette laughed now
cosette's face had even undergone a change to a certain extent
the gloom had disappeared from it
a smile is the same as sunshine it vanishes winter from the human countenance
recreation over when cosette went into the house again jean valjean gazed at the windows of her classroom and at night he rose to look at the windows other dormitory
god has his own ways moreover the convent contributed like cosette to uphold and complete the bishop's work in jean valjean
it is certain that virtue adjoins price on one side
a bridge built by the devil exists there
jean valjean had been unconsciously perhaps tolerably near that side and that bridge when providence cast his lot in the convent of the petit pic pic so long as he had compared himself only to the bishop he had regarded himself as unworthy and had remained humble but for sometime last he had been comparing himself to men in general and pride was beginning to spring up
who knows
he might have ended by returning very gradually to hatred
the convent stopped him on that downward path
this was the second place of captivity which he had seen
in his youth in what had been for him the beginning of his life and later on quite recently again he had be held another at rightful place a terrible place whose severities had always appeared to him the iniquity of justice and the crime of the law
now after the valley she saw the cloister and when he hesitated how he had formed a part of the valleys and that he now so to speak was a spectator of the cloister he confronted the two in his own mind with anxiety
sometimes he crossed his arms and leaned on his hoe and slowly descended the endless spirals of devery
he recalled his former companion show wretched they were they rose at dawn and toiled until night hardly were they permitted to sleep they lay on camp beds where nothing was tolerated but mattresses two inches thick on rooms which were heated only in the very harshest months of the year they were clothed in frightful red blouses they were allowed as a great favor linen trousers in the hottest weather and a woollen carter's blouse in their backs when it was very cold they drank now i mean date home at except when they went on fatigue duty
they lived nameless designated only by numbers and converted after a manner into ciphers themselves with downcast eyes with lowered voices with shorn heads beneath the cudgel and in disgrace
then his mind reverted to the beings whom he had under his eyes
these beings also lived with shorn heads with downcast eyes with lowered voices not in disgrace but amid the scores of the world not with their backs bruised with the cudgel but with their shoulders lacerated with their discipline
their names also had vanished from among men that no longer existed except under austere appellations
they never ate meat and they never drank wine they often remained until evening with our food they were attired not in a red blouse but in a black shroud of woollen which was heavy in summer and thin in winter without the power to add or subtract anything from it without having even according to the season there source of the linen garment of the woollen cloak and for six months in the year they do reserve chemises which gave them fever
they dwelt not in rooms warmed only during rigorous cold but in cells where no fire was ever lighted they slept not on mattresses two inches thick but on straw
and finally they were not even allowed their sleep every night after a day of toil they were obliged in the weariness of their first slumber at the moment when they were falling sound asleep and beginning to get warm to rouse themselves to rise and to go and pray in an ice cold and gloomy chapel with their knees on the stones
in certain days each of these beings in turn had to remain for twelve successive hours in a kneeling posture or prostrate with face upon the pavement and arms outstretched in the form of a cross
the others were men these were women
what had those men done
they had stolen violated pillaged murdered assassinated
they were bandits counterfeiters poisoned since n diaries murderers patrick rss
what had these women done
they had done nothing whatever
on the one hand highway robbery fraud deceit violence sensuality homicide all sorts of sacrilege every variety of crime on the other one thing only innocence
perfect innocence almost caught up into heaven in a mysterious assumption attached to the earth by virtue already possessing something of heaven through holiness
on the one hand confidence cover crimes which are exchanged in whispers in the other the confession of faults made a loud
and what crimes
and what faults
on the one hand miasma on the other an ineffable perfume
on the one hand a moral pest guarded from sight penned up under the range of cannon and literally devouring its plague stricken victims on the other the chaste flame of all souls on the same hearth
there darkness here the shadow but a shadow filled with gleams of light and of gleams full of radiance
two strongholds of slavery but in the first deliverance possible a legal limit always insight and they escape
in the second perpetuity the sole hope at the distant extremity of the future that faint light of liberty which men call death
in the first men are bound only with chains in the other chained by faith
what flowed from the first
an immense curse the gnashing of teeth hatred desperate viciousness a cry of rage against human society a sarcasm against heaven
what results flowed from the second
blessings and love
and in these two places so similar yet so unlike these two species of beings who were so very unlike were undergoing the same worked piaf job
jean valjean understood thoroughly the expiation of the former that personal expiation the expiation for one's self
but he did not understand that of these last that of creatures without reproach and without stain and he trembled as he asked himself the expiation of what
what expiation
a voice within his conscience replied the most divine of human renfro cities the expiation for others
here all personal theory is withheld we are only the narrator we place ourselves at jean valjean's point of view and we translate his impressions
before his eyes he had the sublime summit of abnegation the highest possible pitch of virtue the innocence which pardons mem their faults and which expiate's in their stead servitude submitted to torture accepted punishment claimed by souls which have not signed for the sake of sparingly to souls which have fallen the love of humanity swallowed up in the love of god but even there preserving its distinct and media torial character sweet and feeble be inns possessing the misery of those who are punished and the smile of those who are recompensed
and he remembered that he had dared to murmur
often in the middle of the night he rose to listen to the grateful song of those innocent creatures weighed down with severities and the blood ran cold in his veins at the thought that those who were justly chastised raised their voices heavenward only in blasphemy and that he wretch that he was had shaken his fist at god
there was one striking thing which caused him to meditate deeply like a warning whisper from providence itself the scaling of thats all the passing of those barriers the adventure accepted even at the risk of wrath the painful and difficult ascent all those efforts even which he had made to escape from that other place of expiation he had made in order to gain entrance into this one
was this a symbol of his destiny
this house was a prison likewise and bore a melancholy resemblance to that other one whence he had fled and yet he had never conceived an idea of anything similar
again he beheld gratings bolts iron bars to guard whom
angels
these lofty walls which he had seen around tigers he now be held once more around lambs
this was a place of expiation and not of punishment and yet it was still more austere more gloomy and more pitiless than the other
these virgins were even more heavily burdened than the convicts
a cold harsh wind that wind which had chilled his youth traversed the barred and padlocked grating of the vultures a still harsher and more buying breeze blew in the care of these codes
why
when he thought on these things all that was within him was lost in amazement before this mystery of sublimity
in these meditations his pride vanished
be scrutinized his own heart in all manner of way she felt his pettiness and many a time he wept
all that had entered into his life for the last six months had led him back towards the bishop's holy injunctions cosette through love the convent through humility
sometimes at eventide in the twilight at an hour when the garden was deserted he could be seen on his knees in the middle of the wall which skirted the chapel in front of the window through which he had based on the night of his arrival and turned towards the spot where as he knew the sister was making reparation prostrated in prayer
thus he prayed as he knelt before the sister
it seemed as though he dared not kneel directly before god
everything that surrounded him that peaceful garden those fragrant fl users those children who uttered joyous cries those brave and simple women that silent cloister slowly permeated jim and little by little his soul became compounded of silence like the cloister of perfume like the flowers of simplicity like the women of joy like the children
and then he reflected that these had been two houses of god which had received him in succession at two critical moments in his life the first when all doors were closed and when human society rejected him the second at a moment when human society had again set out in pursuit of him and when the valleys were again yawning and that had it not been for the first he should have relapsed into crime and had it not been for the second in to torment
his whole heart melted in gratitude and he loved more and more
many years passed in this manner cosette was growing up

couple these two ideas which contain the one all the furnace the other all the dawn strike these two sparks together paris childhood there leaps out from them a little being
to nuncio plautus would say
this little being is joyous
he has not good everyday and he goes to the play every evening if he sees good
he has no shirt on his body no shoes on his feet no roof over his head he is like the flies of heaven who have none of these things
he is from seven to thirteen years of age he lives in bands roams the streets lodges in the open air wears an old pair of trousers of his father's which descend below his heels an old hat of some other father which descends below his ears a single suspended of yellow listing he runs lies in wait rummaged about wastes time blackend pipes swears like a convict haunts the wine shop knows thieves calls gay women thou talks slang sings obscene songs and has no evil in his heart
this is because he has in his heart a pearl innocence and pearls are not to be dissolved in mud
so long as banks in his childhood god wills that he shall be innocent
if one were to ask that enormous city what is this
she would reply it is my little one
chapter ii some of his particular characteristics the dam in the street arab of paris is the dwarf of the giant
let us not exaggerate this cherub of the gutter sometimes has a short but in that case he owns but one he sometimes has shoes but then they have no sole she sometimes has a lodging and he loves it for he finds his mother there but he prefers the street because there he finds liberty
he has his own games his own bits of mischief whose foundation consists of hatred for the bourgeois his peculiar metaphors to be dead is to eat dandelions by the root his own occupations calling hackney coaches letting down carriage steps establishing means of transit between the two sides of a street in heavy rains which he calls making the bridge of arts crying discourses pronounced by the authorities in favor of the french people cleaning out the cracks in the pavement he has his own coinage which is composed of all the little morsels of worked copper which are found on the public streets
this curious money which receives the name of lo que stage has an invariable and well regulated currency in this little bohemia of children
lastly he has his own fauna which he observes attentively in the corners the ladybird the death's head plant louse the daddy longlegs the devil a black insect which menaced by twisting about its tail armed with two horns
he has his fabulous monster which has scales under its belly but is not a lizard which has pustules on its back but is not a road which inhabits the books of old lime kiln sandwell's that have run dry which is black hairy sticky which crawls sometimes slowly sometimes rapidly which has no cry but which has a look and is so terrible that noone has ever beheld if he calls this monster the dead thing
the search for these dead things among the stones is a job of formidable nature
another pleasure consists in suddenly prying up a paving stone and taking a look at the ap of life
each region of paris is celebrated for the interesting treasures which are to be found there
there are earwigs in the timber yards of the ursuline's there are mille person the pantheon there are tadpoles in the witches of the champs de mars
as far as sayings are concerned this child has as many of them as talleyrand
he is no less cynical but he is more honest
he is endowed with a certain indescribable unexpected jovial of the upsets the composure of the shopkeeper with his wild laughter
he ranges boldly from high comedy to farce
a funeral passes by
among those who accompany the dead there is a doctor
hey there
shouts some street arab how long has it been customary for doctors to carry home their own work
another is in a crowd
a brave man adorned with spectacles and trinkets turnaround indignantly you good for nothing you have seized my wife's waist
is jr.
search me
chapter iii he is agreeable in the evening thanks to a few sous which he always finds means to procure the go nuncio enters a theatre
on crossing that magic threshold he becomes transfigured he was the street arab he becomes the titi
theatres are a sort of ship turned upside down with the keel in the air
it is in that keep that the titi huddle together
the hit list other am in what the moth is to the larva the same being endowed with wings and soaring
it suffices for him to be there with his radiance of happiness with his power of enthusiasm and joy with his hand clapping which resembles a clapping of wings to confer on that marrow darkest of sordid unhealthy hideous abominable keep the name of paradise
bestow on an individual the useless and deprive him of the necessary and you have the gamin
the gamin is not devoid of literary intuition
his tendency and we say it with the proper amount of regret would not constitute classic taste
he is not very academic by nature
thus to give an example the popularity of mademoiselle mars among that little audience of stormy children was seasoned with a touch of irony
the gamin called her mademoiselle much rhode yourself
this being basis and scores and ridiculed and fights has tags like a baby and tatters like a philosopher fishes in the sewer hunts in the cesspool extracts mirth from voip news whips up the squares with his wit veins and bites whistles and sings about sander risks tempers alleluia with natan the lure the change every rhythm from the de profundis to the jack pudding finds without seeking knows what he is ignorant of is a spartan to the point of thieving is mad to wisdom is lyrical to filth would crouch down on olympus wallows in the dunghill and emerges from it covered with stars
the gamin of paris is rabelais in this youth
he is not content with his trousers unless they have a watch pocket
he is not easily astonished he is still less easily testified he makes songs in superstition she takes the wind out of exaggeration where it's mysteries her trusts out his tongue at ghost she takes the poetry out of stilted things he introduces caricature into epic extravaganzas
it is not that he is prosaic far from that but he replaces the solemn vision by the farcical phantasmagoria
if add maxtor were to appear to him the street arab would say hi there
the bugaboo
chapter iv he may be of use paris begins with the lounger and ends with the street arab two beings of which no other city is capable the passive acceptance which contents itself with gazing and the inexhaustible initiative prudhomme and to kill ku
paris alone has this in its natural history
the whole of the monarchy is contained in the lounger the whole of anarchy in the gamin
this pale child of the parisian faubourg's lives and develops makes connections grows supple in suffering in the presence of social realities and of human things a thoughtful witness
he thinks himself heedless and he is not
he looks and is on the verge of laughter he is on the verge of something else also
whoever you may be if your name is prejudice abuse ignorance oppression iniquity despotism injustice fanaticism tyranny beware of the gaping gamin
the little fellow will grow up
of what clay is he made
of the first mud that comes to hand
a handful of dirt a breath and behold adam
it suffices for a bid to pass by
a god has always passed over the street arab
fortune labors at this tiny being
by the word fortune we mean chance to some extent
that pink uk headed out of common earth ignorant unlettered giddy vulgar low
will that become an ionian or a boeotia m
wait sure it rota the spirit of paris that demon which creates the children of chance and the men of destiny reversing the process of the latin potter makes of a jug an amphora
chapter v his frontiers the gamin loves the city he also loves solitude since he has something of the safe in him
urbis amator like fuscus eur is what it like flaccus
to roam thoughtfully about that is to say to lounge is a fine employment of time in the eyes of the philosopher particularly in that rather illegitimate species of campaign which is tolerably ugly buried and composed of two natures which surrounds certain great cities notably paris
to study the suburbs is to study the amphibious animal
end of the trees beginning of the roofs end of the grass beginning of the pavements end of the furrows beginning of the shops end of the wheel rugs beginning of the passions end of the divine murmur beginning of the human uproar hence an extraordinary interest
hence in these not very attractive places indelibly stamped by the passing stroller with the epithet melancholy the apparently object less promenades of the dreamer
he who writes these lines has long been a prowler about the barriers of paris and it is for him a source of profound souvenirs
that closest a venture those pebbly paths that chalk those pools those harsh mon ironies of waste and fallow land's the plants of early market garden suddenly springing into sight in a bottom that mixture of the savage and the citizen those vast desert books where the harrison drums practice noisily and produce a sort of lisp ing of battle those hermits by day and cutthroats by night that clumsy mill which turns in the wind the hoisting wheels of the quarries the tea gardens at the corners of the cemeteries the mysterious charm of great sombre walls squarely intersecting immense vague stretches of land inundated with sunshine and full of butterflies all this attracted him
there is hardly anyone on earth who is not acquainted with those singular spots the glaciers the dinette the hideous wall of grenelle all speckled with falls montparnasse the bosses halo up saunier's on the bank of the marne montsouris the tombs is slide the pierre plate de chatillon where there is an old exhausted quarry which no longer serves any purpose except to raise mushrooms and which is closed on a level with the ground by a trap door of rotten planks
the campagna of rome is one idea the banlieue of paris is another to behold nothing but fields houses of trees in what a stretch of country offers us is to remain on the surface all aspects of things are thoughts of god
the spot where a plain effects its junction with a city is always stamped with a certain piercing melancholy
nature and humanity both appeal to you at the same time there
local original ities there make their appearance
anyone who like ourselves has wandered about in these solitudes contiguous to our faubourg's which may be designated as the limbic of paris has seen here and there in the most desert spot at the most unexpected moment behind a meagre hedge or in the corner of a lugubrious wall children grouped tumultuous it fetid muddy dusty ragged dishevelled playing hide and seek and crowned with corn flowers
all of them are little ones who have made their escape from poor families
the outer boulevard is their breathing space the suburbs belong to them
there they are eternally playing truant
there they innocently sing their repertory of dirty songs
there they are or rather there they exist far from every eye in the sweet light of major june kneeling found a hole in the ground snapping marbles with their thumbs quarrelling over half bad things irresponsible volatile free and happy and no sooner do they catch sight of you than they recollect that they have an industry and that they must earn their living and they offer to sell you an old woolley stocking filled with cock chafers or a bunch of lilacs
these encounters with strange children are one of the charming and at the same time poignant graces of the environs of paris
sometimes there are little girls among the throng of boys are they their sisters
who are almost young maiden's thin feverish with sunburnt hands covered with freckles crowned with poppies and wars of the gay haggard barefooted
they can be seen devouring cherries among the wheat
in the evening they can be heard laughing
these groups warmly illuminated by the full flow of his fault in distinctly seen in the twilight occupy the thoughtful man for a very long time and these visions mingle with his dreams
paris centre banlieue circumference this constitutes all the earth to those children
they never venture beyond this
they can no more escape from the parisian atmosphere than fish can escape from the water
for them nothing exists two leagues beyond the barriers ivry gentilly arc hell belleville auber villiers menil montant choisy le roi billancourt mendon is a tv and re sevres puteaux neuilly gennevilliers colombes domain ville chat kiss his reebok rival nanterre enghien noisy ies echo rent your mayer andy gone see the universe ends there
chapter vi a bit of history at the epoch nearly contemporary by the way when the action of this book takes place there was not as there is today a policeman at the corner of every street a benefit which there is no time to discuss here stray children abounded in paris
the statistics give an average of two hundred and sixty homeless children picked up annually at that period by the police patrols in unenclosed lands in houses in process of construction and in ddt the arches of the bridges
one of these nests which has become famous produced the swallows of the bridge of arcola
this is more over the most disastrous of social symptoms
all crimes of the man begin in the vagabond age of the child
let us make an exception in favor of paris nevertheless
in a relative measure and in spite of the souvenir which we have just recalled the exception is just
while in any other great city the vagabond child is a postman while nearly everywhere the child left to itself is in some sort sacrificed and abandoned to a kind of fatal immersion in the public vices which devouring in honesty and conscience the street boy of paris we insist on this point to defer defaced and injured on the surface is almost intact on the interior
it is a magnificent thing to put on record and one which shines forth in the splendid probity of our popular revolutions that a certain in corrupt ibility results from the idea which exists in the air of paris as salt exists in the water of the ocean
to breathe paris preserves the soul
what we have just said takes away nothing of the anguish of heart which one experiences every time that one meets one of these children around whom one can cues that he beholds floating the threads of a broken family
in the civilization of the present day incomplete as it still is it is not a very abnormal thing to behold these fractured families pouring themselves out into the darkness not knowing clearly what has become of their children and allowing their own entrails to fall on the public highway
hence these obscure destinies
this is called for this sad thing has given rise to an expression to be fast in the pavements of paris
let it be said by the way that this abandonment of children was not discouraged by the ancient monarchy
a little of egypt and bohemia in the lower regions suited the upper spheres and compasses the aims of the powerful
the hatred of instruction for the children of the people was a dogma
what is the use of half lights
such was the countersign
now the erring child is the corollary of the ignorant child
besides this the monarchy sometimes was in need of children and in that case it skimmed the streets
under louis xiv
not to go any further back the king tightly desired to create a fleet
the idea was a good one
but let us consider the means
there can be no fleet of beside the sailing ship that plaything of the winds and for the purpose of towing it in case of necessity there is not the vessel which goes where it pleases either by means of oars or of steam the valleys were then to the marine what steamers are today
therefore valleys were necessary but the valley is moved only by the valley slave hence galley slaves were required
coin set has the commissioners of provinces and the parliament's name as many convicts as possible
the magistracy showed a great deal of com plaisance in the matter
a man kept his hat on in the presence of a procession it was a huguenot attitude he was sent to the galleys
a child was encountered in the streets provided that he was fifteen years of age and did not know where he was to sleep he was sent to the galleys
grand reign grand century
under louis xv
children disappeared in paris the police carried them off for what mysterious purpose no one knew
people whispered with terror monstrous conjecture was to the king's baths of purple
barbier speaks ingeniously of these things
it sometimes happened that the exempts of the guard when they ran short of children took those who had fathers
the fathers in despair attacked the exempts
in that case the parliament intervened and had someone hung
who
the exempts
not be fathers
chapter vii the gamin should have his place in the class ifications of india the body of street arabs in paris almost constitutes a vast e
one might almost say not everyone who wishes to belong to it can do so
this word gamin was printed for the first time and reached popular speech through the literary tongue in
it is in a little work entitled claude the us that this word made its appearance
the horror was lively
the word passed into circulation
the elements which constitute the consideration of the famine for each other are very various
we have known and associated with one who was greatly respected and vastly admired because he had seen a man fall from the top of the tower of notre dame another because he had succeeded in making his way into the rear courtyard where the statues of the some of the invalides has been temporarily deposited and had progged some lead from them a third because he had seen a diligence tip over still another because he knew a soldier who came near putting out the eye of a citizen
this explains that famous exclamation of a parisian gamin a profound epiphone ma which the vulgar here laughs at without comprehending dieu de dieu
what ill luck i do have
to think that i have never get seen anybody tumble from a fifth story window
i have pronouncedl' age and fifth pronounced gift'
surely this saying of a peasant is a fine one father's land so your wife has died of her malady why did you not send for the doctor
what would you have sir we poor folks die of ourselves
but if the peasant's whole passivity lies in this saying the whole of the free thinking anarchy of the best of the faubourg's is assuredly contained in this other saying
a man condemned to death is listening to his confessor in the timbre l
the child of paris exclaims he is talking to his black cap
on the sneak
a certain audacity on matters of religion sets off the gamin
to be strong minded is an important item
to be present an execution a constitutes a duty
he shows himself at the guillotine and he laughs
he calls it by all sorts of pet names the end of the soup the growler the mother in the glue the sky the last mouthful etc.
etc.
in order not to lose anything of the affair he scales the wall and hoists himself to balconies he ascends trees he suspends himself to grating checking's best to chimneys
the gamin is born a timer as he is born a mariner
ark of inspires him with no more fear than am ast
there is no festival which comes up to an execution on the place de greve
samson and the anne mont we are the truly popular names
they blog at the victim in order to encourage him

this child was well muffled up in a pair of man's trousers but he did not get them from his father and a woman's chemise but he did not get it from his mother
some people or other bad clothes hiking and out of charity
still he had a father and a mother
but his father did not think of him and his mother did not love him
he was one of those children most deserving of pity among all one of those who have father and mother and who are orphans nevertheless
this child never felt so well as when he was in the street
the pavements were less hard to him than his mother's heart
his parents had despatched him into life with a kick
he simply took flight
he was a boisterous pallid nimble wide awake meeting law with a vivacious but sickly air
he went and came sang played at hopscotch scraped the gutters stole a little bit like cats and sparrows gayly laughed when he was called a rogue and got angry when called a thief
he had no shelter no bread no fire no love but he was merry because he was feed
when these poor creatures grow to be men the millstones of the social order meet them and crush them but so long as they are children they escape because of their email news
the tiniest hole saves them

this new old woman was named madame four non and had nothing remarkable about her life except a dynasty of three park queue who had reigned in succession over her soul
the most miserable of those who inhabited the novel were a family of four persons consisting of father mother and two daughters already well grown all four of whom were lodged in the same attic one of the cells which we have already mentioned

his mother said to him what did you come here for
this child lived in this absence of affection like the pale plants which spring up in cellars
it did not cause him suffering and he blamed no one
he did not know exactly how a father and mother should be

this silhouette has not yet entirely disappeared for those who regard with melancholy that vague swarm of shadows which is called the past from the labyrinth of streets in the vicinity of the temple to which under louis xiv

he dined at fiveo'clock and after that his door was open

chapter viii two do not make a pair we have just spoken of m
ville norm and's two daughters
they had come into the world ten years apart
in their youth they had borne very little resemblance to each other either in character of countenance and had also been as little like sisters to each other as possible
the youngest had a charming soul which turned towards all that belongs to the light was occupied with flowers with verses with music which fluttered away into glorious space enthusiastic ethereal and was wedded from her very you think deal to a vague and heroic figure
the elder had also get chimeras new spied on the azure some very wealthy purveyors contractors splendidly stupid husband a million made man or even a prefect the receptions of the prefecture an usher in the antechamber with a chain on his neck official balla the harangued of the town hall to be madame la prefer walk this has created a whirlwind in her imagination
thus the two sisters strayed each other own dream at the epoch when they were young girls
both had wings the one like an angel the other like a goose
no ambition is ever fully realized here below at least
no paradise becomes terrestrial in our day
the younger wedded the man of her dreams but she died
the elder did not marry at all
at the moment when she makes her entrance into this history which we are delaying she was an antique virtues noncombustible pride with one of the sharpest nodes and one of the most of tna's minds that it is possible to see
a characteristic detail outside of her immediate family no one had ever known her first name
she was called mademoiselle ville norm and the elder

her modesty was carried to the other extreme of blackness
she cherished a frightful memory of her life one day a man had beheld her garter

she multiplied clasps and pins where no one would have dreamed of looking

beyond the agnus dei and ave maria mademoiselle day bois had no knowledge of anything except of the different ways of making preserves
mademoiselle day bois perfect in her style was the ermine of stupidity without a single spot of intelligence
let us say it plainly mademoiselle ville norm and had gained rather than lost as she grew older
this is the case with passive natures
she had never been malicious which is relative kindness and then years wear away the angles and the softening which comes with time had come to her
she was melancholy with an obscure sadness of which she did not herself know the secret
there breathed from her whole person the stupor of a life that was finished and which had never had a beginning

these households comprised of an old man and a good spinster are not rare and always have the touching aspect of two weaknesses leaning on each other for support

madame de t

he lived there alone and solitary silently and poorly with a woman who was neither young not old neither homely not pretty neither a peasant not a bourgeois e who served him
the plot of earth which he called his garden was celebrated in the town for the beauty of the flowers which he cultivated there
these flowers were his occupation
by dint of labor of perseverance of attention and of buckets of water he had succeeded in creating after the creator and he had invented certain tulips and certain dahlias which seemed to have been forgotten by nature
he was ingenious he had forestalled soul anne bodin in the formation of little clumps of earth of heath mould for the cultivation of rare and precious shrubs from america and china
he was in his alleys from the break of day in summer planting cutting boeing watering walking amid his flowers with an air of kindness sadness and sweetness sometimes standing motionless and thoughtful for hours listening to the song of a bird in the trees the babble of a child in a house or with his eyes fixed on a drop of dewar the top of a spear of grass of which the sun made a carbuncle
his table was very plain and he drank more milk than wine
a child could make him give way and his servant scolded him
he was so timid that he seemed why he rarely went out and he saw no one but the poor people who tapped's this page and his cure the abbe babe if a good old man
nevertheless of the inhabitants of the town of strangers or any chance comers curious to see his tulips ranga this little cottage he opened his door with a smile
he was the brigand of the loire
anyone who had at the same time read military memoirs biographies the moniteur and the bulletins of the grand army would have been struck by a name which occurs there with tolerable frequency the name of george's long mercy
when very young this georges pont mercy had been a soldier in saint onge's regiment
the revolution broke out
saint onge's regiment formed a part of the army of the rhine for the old regiments of the monarchy preserved their names of provinces even after the fall of the monarchy and were only divided into brigades in

he was under kleber at march lenges and at the battle of non goal is sep where a ball from a fiscal en broke his arm
then he passed to the frontier of italy and was one of the thirty grenadiers who defended the colder ends with joubert
joubert was appointed its adjutant general and pony mercy sub lieutenant
long mercy was by berthier's side in the midst of the grape shot of that day at lodi which caused bonaparte to say berthier has been can no need cavalier and grenadier
he beheld his old general joubert fall at novi at the moment when with uplifted sabre he was shouting forward
having been embarked with his company in the exigencies of the campaign on board alignace which was proceeding from genoa to some obscure port on the coast he fell into a wasps' best of seven or eight english vessels
the genoese commander wanted to throw his cannon into the sea to hide the soldiers between decks and to slip along in the dark as a merchant vessel
pont mercy had the colors hoisted to the peak and sailed proudly past under the guns of the british frigates
twenty leagues further on his audacity having increased he attacked with his pin made and captured a large english transport which was carrying troops to sicily and which was so loaded down with men and horses that the vessel was sunk to the level of the sea

he was well slashed upon this occasion and twenty seven splinters were extracted from his left arm alone
eight days before the capitulation of paris he had just exchanged with a comrade and entered the cavalry
he had what was called under the old regime the double hand that is to say an equal aptitude for handling the sabre of the musket as a soldier of a squadron of a battalion as an officer
it is from this aptitude perfected by a military education which certain special branches of the service arise the dragoons for example who are both cavalrymen and infantry a time and the same time
he accompanied napoleon to the island of elba
at waterloo he was chief of a squadron of cuir assists in dubois' brigade
it was he who captured the standard of the lunenburg battalion

the emperor greatly pleased shouted to him you are a colonel you are a baron you are an officer of the legion of honor
pont mercy replied sure i thank you for my widow
an hour later he fell in the ravine o domain
now who was this george's long mercy
he was this same brigand of the loire
we have already seen something of his history
after waterloo pont mercy who had been pulled out of the hollow road ifp main as it will be remembered had succeeded in joining the army and had dragged himself from ambulance to ambulance as far as the canton ments of the loire
the restoration had placed him on half pay them had sent him into residence that is to say under surveillance at vernon
king louis xviii
regarding all that which had taken place during the hundred day was not having occurred at all did not recognize his quality as an officer of the legion of honor nor his grace of colonel norris title of baron
he on his side neglected no occasion of signing himself colonel baron pont mercy
he had only an old blue coat and he never went out without fastening to it now rosette as an officer of the legion of honor
the attorney for the crown had him warned that the authorities would prosecute him for illegal wearing of this decoration
when this notice was conveyed to him through an officious intermediary pont mercy retorted with a bitter smile i do not know whether i no longer understand french or whether you no longer speak it but the fact is that i do not understand
then he went out for eight successive days with his rosette
they dared not interfere with him
two or three times the minister of war and the general in command of the department wrote to him with the following address a monsieur le commandant pont jerzy
he sent back the letters with the seals unbroken
at the same moment napoleon at saint helena was treating in the same fashion the missives of sir hudson lowe addressed to general bonaparte
pont mercy has ended may we be pardoned the expression by having in his mouth the same saliva as his emperor
in the same way there were at rome carthaginian prisoners who refused to salute to a mini us and who had a little of hannibal's spirit
one day he encountered the district attorney in one of the streets of vernon stepped up to him and said mr
crown attorney am i permitted to wear my scar
he had nothing save his meagre half pay as chief of squadron
he had hired the smallest house which he could find at vernon
he lived there alonewe have just seen how
under the empire between two wars he had found time to maddy mademoiselle ville normand
the old blir vel is thoroughly indignant at bottom had given his consent with a sign saying the greatest families are forced into it
in madame pont mercy an admirable woman in every sense by the way lofty in sentiment and rare and worthy of her husband died leaving a child
this child had been the colonel's joy in his solitude but the grandfather had imperatively claimed his grandson declaring that if the child were not given to him he would die in merit him
the father had yielded in the little one's interest and had transferred his love to flowers
moreover he had renounced everything and neither stirred up mischief not conspired
he shared his thoughts between the innocent things which he was then doing and the great things which he had done
he passed his time in expecting a pink or in recalling austerlitz
m

the colonel was a bandit to him
m
gillen or hand never mentioned the colonel except when he pc cd sionally have mocking allusions to his baron ship
it had been expressly agreed that long mercy should never attempt to see hudson not to speak to him under penalty of having the latter handed over to him disowned and disinherited
for the gillen or hands pont mercy was a man afflicted with the plague
they intended to bring up the child in their own way
perhaps the colonel was wrong to accept these conditions but he submitted to the'm thinking that he was doing right and sacrificing no one but himself
the inheritance of father ville firm and did not amount to much but the inheritance of mademoiselle ville norm and the elder was considerable
this aunt who had remained unmarried was very rich on the maternal side and her sister's son was her natural heir
the boy whose name was marius knew that he had a father but nothing more
no one opened his mouth to him about it
nevertheless in the society into which his grandfather took him whispers innuendoes and winks had eventually enlightened the little boy's mind he had finally under a good something of the case and as he naturally took in the ideas and opinions which were so to speak the air he breathed by a sort of infiltration and slow penetration he gradually came to think of his father only with shame and with a pain at his heart
while he was growing up in this fashion the colonel slipped away every two or three months came to paris on the sky like a criminal breaking his bag and went and posted himself at saint sulpice at the hour when aunt gillen or handled marius to the mass
there trembling lest the aunt should turn round concealed behind a pillar motionless not daring to breathe he gazed at his child
the scarred veteran was afraid of that old spinster
from this had arisen his connection with the cure of vernon m
l' abbe man eur
that worthy priest was the brother of awards not saint sulpice who had often observed this man gazing at his child and the scar on his cheek and the large tears in his eyes
that man who had some not an air yet who was weeping like a woman had struck the warden
that face had clung to his mind
one day having gone to vernon to see his brother he had encountered colonel pont mercy on the bridge and had recognized the man of saint sulpice
the warden had mentioned the circumstance to the cure and both had paid the colonel a visit on some pretext or other
this visit led to others
the colonel who had been extremely reserves at first ended by opening his heart and the cure and the warden finally came to know the whole history and how long mercy was sacrificing his happiness to his child's future
this caused the cure to regard him with generation and tenderness and the colonel on his side became fond of the cure
and moreover when both are sincere and good nomen so penetrate each other and so amalgamate with each other as an old priest and an old soldier
at bottom the man is the same
the one has devoted his life to his country here below the other to his country on high that is the only difference
twice a year on the first of january an const
george's day marius wrote duty letters to his father which were dictated by his aunt and which one would have pronounced to be copied from some formula this was all that m
gillen or make tolerated and the father answered them with very tender letters which the grandfather thrust into his pocket unread
chapter iii require cant madame de t
's salon was all that marius pont mercy knew of the world
it was the only opening through which he could get a glimpse of life
this opening was sombre and more cold than warmth more night then day came to him through this skylight
this child who had been all joy and light on entering this strange world soon became melancholy and what is still more contrary to his age grave
surrounded by all those singular and imposing parsonage she gazed about him with serious amazement
everything conspired to increase this astonishment in him
there were in madame de t

these antique visages and these biblical names mingled in the child's mind with the old testament which he was learning by heart and when they were all there seated in a circle around a dying fire spare it lighted by a lamp shades with green with their severe profiles their gray or white hair their long gowns of another age whose lugubrious colors could not be distinguished dropping a trade intervals words which were both majestic and severe little marius stared at them with frightened eyes in the conviction that he beheld not women but patriarchs and maginot real beings but phantoms
with these phantoms priests were sometimes mingled frequent era of this ancient salon and some gentlemen the marquis de was a private secretary to madame de berry the vicomte de val who published under the pseudonym for charles antoine mom or gym erodes the prince de beaute who though very young had a gray head and a pretty and witty wife whose very low necked toilettes of scarlet velvet with gold tot saves alarmed these shadows the marquis de cd's the man in all france who best understood proportioned politeness the comted' am the kindly man with the amiable chin and the chevalier de port de buy a pillar of the library of the louvre called the king's cabinet m

we talleyrand
he had been m
le comted' artois' companion in pleasures and unlike aristotle crouching under campaspe he had made the gui hard crawl on all fours and in that way he had exhibited to the ages a philosopher avenged by a bailiff

lastly two cardinals m
de la luzerne and m
decor
the cardinal of luzerne was a writer and was destined to have a few years later the honor of signing in the c observateur articles side by side with chateaubriand m
dec it was archbishop of toil and often made trips to paris to his nephew the marquis de r who was minister of marine and war
the cardinal off it was a merry little man who displayed his red stockings beneath his fucked up cassock his specialty was a hatred of the encyclopaedia and his desperate play at billiards and persons who at that epoch passed through the rue mon summer evenings where the hotel dec it then stood halted to listen to the shock of the balls and the piercing voice of the cardinal shouting to his son clavier monseigneur co first bishop in part of us of cary's remarks by ei make a cannon
the cardinal dec it had been brought to madame de t
's by his most intimate friend m
seroquel site former bishop of senlis and one of the forty
m
seroquel sure was notable for his lofty figure and his assiduity at the academy through the glass door of the neighboring hall of the library where the french academy then held its meetings the curious could on every tuesday contemplate the ex bishop of senlis usually standing erect freshly powdered in viola those with his back turned to the door apparently for the purpose of allowing a better view of his little collar
all these ecclesiastics thought of the most part as much courtiers as churchmen added to the gravity of the t
salon whose self nike jak aspect was accentuated by five peers of france the marquis de vin the marquis de tal the marquis de herb the vicomte dan band the duc de val
this duc de cap although prince demon that is to say a reigning prince abroad had so high an idea of france and it's peerage that he viewed everything through their medium
it was he who said the cardinals are the peers of france of rome the lords are the peers of france or england
moreover as it is indispensable that the revolution should be everywhere in this century this feudal salon was as we have said dominated by a bourgeois
m
ville norman designed there
the relay the essence and quintessence of the parisian white society
there reputation seven royalist reputations were held in quarantine
there is always a trace of anarchy in renown
chateaubriand had he entered there would have produced the effect of pete du che ne
some of the scoffed at did nevertheless penetrate thither on sufferance
comte be it was received there subject to correction
the noble salons of the present day no longer resemble those salons
the faubourg saint germain reeks of the bag or even now
the royalists of today are demagogues let us record it to their credit
at madame de r
's the society was superior taste was exquisite and haughty under the cover of a great show of politeness
manners the readmitted of all sorts of involuntary refinements which were the old regime itself buried but still alive
some of these habits especially in the matter of language seem eccentric
persons but superficially acquainted with them would have taken for provincial that which was only antique
a woman was called madame la generale
madame la colonel le was not entirely disused
the charming madame de leon in memory no doubt of the duchesse see longueville and we chevre use preferred this appellation to her title of princesse
the marquise de crew it was also called madame la colonel le
it was this little high society which invented at the tuileries the refinement of speaking to the king in private as the king in the third person and never as your majesty the designation of your majesty having been soiled by the usurper
men and deeds were brought to judgment there
they jeered at the age which released them from the necessity of understanding it
they abetted each other in amazement
they communicated to each other that modicum of light which they possessed
methuselah be stored information one like nodes
the dead man made the blind man acquainted with the course of things
they declared that the time which have lacked since coblentz had not existed
in the same manner that louis xviii
was by the grace of god in the five and twentieth year of his reign the emigrants were by rights in the five and twentieth year of their adolescence
all was harmonious nothing was too much alive speech hardly amounted to a breath the newspapers agreeing with the salons seemed a papyrus
there were some young people but they were rather dead
the liveries in the antechamber were antiquated
these utterly obsolete personages were served by domestics of the same stamp
they all had the air of having lived a long time ago and of obstinately resisting the sepulchre
nearly the whole dictionary consisted of conserved conservation c observateur to be on good odor that was the point
there are in fact aromatics in the opinions of these venerable groups and their ideas smelled of it
it was a mummified society
the masters were embalmed the servants were stuffed with straw
a worthy old marquise an emigres and ruined who had but a solitary maid continues to say my people
what did they do in madame de t
's salon
they were ultra
to be ultra this word although what it represents may not have disappeared has no longer any meaning at the present day
let us explain it
to be ultra is to go beyond
it is to attack the sceptre in the name of the throne and the mitre in the name of the art at it is to oil treat the thing which one is dragging it is to kick over the traces it is to casio at the favor on the score of the amount of cooking received by heretics it is to reproach the idol with its small amount of idolatry it is to insult through excess of respect it is to discover that the pope is not sufficiently papist that the king is not sufficiently royal and that the night has too much light it is to be discontented with alabaster with snow with the swan and the lily in the name of whiteness it is to be a partisan of things to the point of becoming their enemy it is to be so strongly for as to be against
the ultra spirit especially characterizes the first phase of the restoration
nothing in history resembles that quarter of an hour which begins in and terminates about with the advent of m
deville of the practical man of the right
these six years were an extraordinary moment at one and the same time brilliant and gloomy smiling and sombre illuminated as by the radiance of dawn and entirely covered at the same time with the shadows of the great catastrophes which still filled the horizon and were slowly sinking into the last
there existed on that light and that shadows complete little new and old world comic and sad juvenile and senile which was rubbing it's eyes nothing resembles an awakening like a return a group which regarded france with ill temper and which france regarded with irony good old owls of marquis de by the street ful who had returned and of ghosts the former subjects of amazement at everything brave and noble gentlemen who smiled at being in france but sept also delighted to behold their country once more in despair at not finding their monarchy the nobility of the crusades treating the nobility of the empire that is to say the nobility of the sword with scorn historic races who had lost the sense of history the sons of the companions of charlemagne disdain ing the companions of napoleon
the swords as we have just remarked returned the insult the sword of fontenoy was laughable and nothing but a scrap of rusty it on the sword of marengo was odious and was only a wahre
former days did not recognize yesterday
people no longer had the feeling for what was grand
there was someone who called bonaparte's cap in
this society no longer exists
nothing of it we repeat exists today
when we select from it someone figure at random and attempt to make it love again in thought it seems as strange to us as the world before the deluge
it is because it too as a matter of each has been engulfed in a deluge
it has disappeared beneath two revolutions
what follows are ideas
how quickly they cover all that it is their mission to destroy and to bury and how promptly they create frightful rules
such was the physiognomy of these logs of those distant and candid times when m
mary a. in ville had not edit than voltaire
these salons had a literature and politics of their own
they believed info ever
m
a gift laid down the law in them
they comments term
colney the old bookseller and publicist of the quay malasia is
napoleon was to them thoroughly the corsican ogre
later on the introduction into history of m
le marquis de bonaparte lieutenant general of the king's armies was a concession to the spirit of the age
these salons did not long preserve their purity
beginning with doc trimark and began to spring upon them a disturbing shade
their way was to be royalists and to excuse themselves for being so
where the ultras were very proud the distri mariana were rather ashamed
they have it they had silence their political dogma was suitably impregnated with arrogance they should have succeeded
they indulged and usefully too in excesses in the matter of white neck ties and tightly buttoned coats
the mistake of the misfortune of the doctrine fish party was to create aged youth
they assumed the poses of wise men
they dreamed of engr adding a temperate power on the absolute and excessive principle
they opposed and sometimes with rare intelligence conservative liberalism to the liberalism which demolished
they were heard to say thanks for royal icm
it has rendered more than one service
it has brought back tradition worship religion respect
it is faithful brave chivalric loving devoted
it has mingled though with regret the secular grandeur's of the monarchy with the new grandeur's of the nation
it's mistake is not to understand the revolution the empire glory liberty young ideas young generation's the age
but this mistake which it makes with regard to us have we not sometimes been guilty of it towards them
the revolution whose heirs we are ought to be intelligent on all points
to attack royal is misamis construction of liberalism
what an error
and what blindness
revolutionary france is waiting in respect towards historic france that is to say towards its mother that is to say towards itself
after the th of september the nobility of the monarchy is treated as the nobility of the empire was treated after the th of july
they were unjust to the eagle we are unjust to the fleur de lys
it seems that we must always have something to proscribe
does it sergeant purpose to unfold the crown of louis xiv
to scrape the cost of arms of henry iv
we scoff at m
decay blanc for erasing then's from the fridge of jena
what was it that he did
what are we doing
buy vines belongs to us as well as marengo
the fleurs de lys are ours as well as then's
that is our patrimony
to what purpose shall we diminish it
we must not deny our country in the past any more than in the present
why not accept the whole of history
why not love the whole of france
it is thus that do stdin arian's criticised and protected royal i am which was displeased at criticism and furious at protection
the ultra a marked the first epoch of royal icm congregation characterized the second
skill follows a edit
let us confine ourselves here to this sketch
in the course of this narrative the author of this book has encountered in his path this curious moment of contemporary history he has been forced to cast a passing glance upon it and to trace once more some of the singular features of this society which is unknown today
but he does it rapidly and without any bitter or derisive idea
souvenirs both respectful and affectionate for they touch his mother attach him to this past
moreover let us remark this same petty world had a grandeur of its own
one may smile at it but one can neither despise not hate it
it was the france of former days
marius pont mercy pursued some studies as all children do
when he emerged from the hands of aunt ville born and his grandfather confided him to a worthy professor of the most purely classic innocence
this young soul which was expanding passed from a prude to a vulgar pedant
marius went through his years of college then he entered the law school
he was a royalist fanatical and severe
he did not move his grandfather much as the latter's gayety and cynicism repelled him and his feelings towards his father were gloomy
he was on the whole a cold and ardent noble generous proud religious enthusiastic law dignified to harshness puerto shyness
chapter iv end of the brig and the conclusion of marius' classical studies coincided with m
ville norm and's departure from society
the old man bade farewell to the faubourg saint germain and to madame de t
's salon and established himself in the mardis in his house of the rue des filles ducal faire
there he had for servants in addition to the porter that chambermaid nicolette who had succeeded to magnon and that short breathed and purdy basque who have been mentioned above
in marius had just attained his seventeenth year
one evening on his return home he saw his grandfather holding a letter in his hand
marius said m
rilke norm and you will set out for vernon tomorrow
why
said marius
to see your father
marius was seized with a trembling fit
he had thought of everything except this that he should one day be called upon to see his father
nothing could be more unexpected more surprising and let us admit it more disagreeable to him
it was forcing estrangement into reconciliation
it was not an affliction but it was an unpleasant duty
marius in addition to his motives of political antipathy was com funded that his father the slash crash
ville norm and called him on his amiable days did not love him this was evident since he had abandoned him to others
feeling that he was not be loved he did not love
nothing is more simple he said to himself
he was so astounded that he did not question m
ville form and
the grandfather resumed it appears that he is ill
he demands your presence
and after a pause he added set out tomorrow morning
i think there is a coach which leaves the courses contained at sixo'clock and which arrives in the evening
take it
he says that here is harte
then he crushed the letter in his hand and thrust it into his pocket
marius might have set out that very evening and have been with his father on the following morning
a diligence from the rue du bon lo i took the trip to rouen by night at that date and passed through vernon
neither marius norm
bolle norm and thought of making inquiries about it
the next day at twilight marius reached vernon
people were just beginning to light their candles
he asked the first person whom he met form
pont mercy's house
for in his own mind he agreed with the restoration and like it did not recognize his father's claim to the title of either colonel of baron
the house was pointed out to him
he rang a woman with a little lamp in her hand opened the door
m
pont mercy
said marius
the woman remained motionless
is this his house
demanded marius
the woman nodded affirmatively
can i speak with him
the woman shook her head
but i am his son
persisted marius
he is expecting me
he no longer expects you said the woman
then he perceived that she was weeping
she pointed to the door of a room on the ground floor he entered
in that room which was lighted by at allow candle standing on the chimney piece there were three men one standing erect another kneeling and one lying at full length on the floor in his shirt
the one on the floor was the colonel
the other two were the doctor and the priest who was engaged in prayer
the colonel had been attacked by brain fever three days previously
as he had a foreboding of evil at the very beginning of his illness he had written tom
ville normand to demand his son
the malady had grown worse
in the very evening of marius' arrival at vernon the colonel had had an attack of delirium he had risen from his bed in spite of the servant's efforts to prevent him crying my son is not coming
i shall go to meet him
then he ran out of his room and fell prostrate on the floor of the antechamber
he had just expired
the doctor had been summoned and the cure
the doctor had arrived too late
the son had also arrived too late
by the dim light of the candle a large text could be distinguished in the pale and prostrate colonel's cheek where it had trickled from his deadeye
the eye was extinguished but the year was not yet dry
that year was his son's delay
marius gazed upon that man whom he beheld for the first time on that venerable and manly face on those open eyes which was not on those white locke those robust limbs on which here and there brown lines markings word thrusts and a sort of red stars which indicated bullet holes were visible
he contemplated that gigantic seat which stamped heroism in that countenance upon which god had imprinted goodness
he reflected that this man was his father and that this man was dead and a still ran over him
the sorrow which he felt was the sorrow which he would have felt in the presence of any other man whom he had chances to behold stretched out in death
anguish poignant anguish was in that chamber
the servant woman was lamenting in a corner the cure was praying and his sins were audible the doctor was wiping his eyes the corpse itself was weeping
the doctor the priest and the woman gazed at marius in the midst of their affliction without uttering a word he was the stranger there
marius who was far too little affected felt ashamed and embarrassed at his own attitude he held his hat in his hand and he dropped it on the floor in order to produce the impression that grief has deprived him of the strength to hold it
at the same time he experienced remorse and he despised himself for behaving in this manner
but was it his fault
he did not love his father
why should be
the colonel had left nothing
the sale of big furniture barely paid the expenses of his burial
the servant found a scrap of paper which she handed to marius
it contained the following in the colonel's hand writing for my son
the emperor made me abadon in the battlefield of waterloo
since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it
that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course
below the colonel had added at that same battle of waterloo a sergeant saved my life
the man's name was the barrier
i think that he has recently been keeping a little inn in a village in the neighborhood of paris at chelles of hong vermeil
if my son meets him he will do all the good he can to the barrier
marius took this paper and preserved it not out of duty to his father but because of that vague respect for death which is always imperious in the heart of man
nothing remained of the colonel
m
ville norman chad his sword and uniform sold to an old clothes dealer
the neighbors devastated the garden and pillaged the rare flowers
the other plants turned to nettles and deeds and died
marius remained only forty eight hours at vernon
after the interment he returned to paris and applied himself again to his law studies with no more thought of his father than if the latter had never lived
in two days the colonel was buried and in three forgotten
marius wired rape on his hat
that was all
chapter v. the utility of going to mass in order to become a revolutionist marius had preserves the religious habits of his childhood
one sunday when he went to hear mass at saint sulpice at that same chapel of the virgin whither his aunt had led him when a small large placed himself behind a pillar being more absent minded and thoughtful than usual on that occasion and knelt down without paying any special need upon a chair of utrecht velvet on the back of which was inscribed this name monsieur have it warden
mass had hardly begun when an old man presented himself and said to marius this is my places or
marius stepped aside promptly and the old man took possession of his chair
the mass concluded marius still stood thoughtfully a few paces distant the old man approached him again and said i beg your pardon site or having disturbed you awhile ago and for again disturbing you at this moment you must have thought he intrusive and i will explain myself
there is no need of that que said marius
yes
went on the old man i do not wish you to have a bad opinion of me
you see i am attached to this place
it seems to me that the mass is better from here
why
i will tell you
it is from this place that i have watched a poor brave father come regularly every two or three months for the last ten years since he had no other opportunity and no other way of seeing his child because he was prevented by family arrangements
he came at the hour when he knew that his son would be brought to mass
the little one never suspected that his father was there
perhaps he did not even know that he had a rather poor innocent
the father kept behind a pillar so that he might not be seen
he gazed at his child and he wept
he adored that little fellow poor man
i could see that
this spot has become sanctified in my sight and i have contracted a habit of coming hitherto listen to the mass
i prefer it to the stall to which i have a right in my capacity of sweden
i knew that unhappy gentleman a little too
he had a father in law a wealthy aunt relatives idon't know exactly what all who threatened to fix inherit the child if he the father saw him
he sacrificed himself in order that his son might be rich and happy someday
he was separated from him because of political opinions
certainly i approve of political opinions but there are people who do not know where to stop
mon dieu
a man is not a monster because he was at waterloo a father is not separated from his child for such a reason as that
he was one of bonaparte's colonels
he is dead i believe
he lived at vernon where i have a brother who is a cure and his name was something like pont marie le mont percy
he had a fine sword cut on my honor
pint mercy suggested marius turning lake
precisely pont mercy
did you know him
sir said marius he was my father
the old warden clasped his hands and exclaimed am
you are the child
yes that's true he must be a man by this time
well
poor child you may say that you had a father who loved you dearly
marius offered his arm to the old man and conducted him to his lodgings
on the following day he said tom
ville norm and i have arranged a hunting party with some friends
will you permit me to be absent for three days
four
replied his grandfather
go and amuse yourself
and he said to his daughter in a low tone and with a wink some love affair
chapter vi the consequences of having met a warden where it was that marius went will be disclosed a little further on
markus was absent for three days then he returned to paris went straight to the library of the law school and asked for the files of them only for
he read the moniteur he read all the histories of the republic and the empire the memorial de sainte helene all the memoirs all the newspapers the bulletins the proclamation she devoured every thing
the first time that he came across his father's name in the bulletins of the grand army he had a fever for a week
he went to see the generals under whom george's long mercy had served among others do item
church warden have it whom he went to see again told him about the life at vernon the colonel's retreat his flowers his solitude
marius came to a full knowledge of that rare sweet and sublime man that species of lion lamb who had been his father
in the meanwhile occupied as he was with this study which absorbed all his moments as well as his thought she hardly saw the gillen or hands at all
he made his appearance at meals then they searched for him and he was not to be found
father ville not hands miles
bah
bah
he is just of the age for the girls
sometimes the old man added the deuce
i thought it was only an affair of gallantry it seems that it is an affair of passion
it was a passion in fact
marius was on the high road to adoring his father
at the same time his ideas underwent an extraordinary change
the phases of this change were numerous and successive
as this is the history of many kinds of our day we think it will prove useful to follow these phases step by step and to indicate the mall
that history upon which he had just cast his eyes appalled jim
the first effect was to dazzle him
up to that time the republic the empire had been to him only monstrous words
the republic a guillotine in the twilight the empire a sword in the night
he had just taken a look at it and where he had expected to find only a chaos of shadows he had be held with a sort of unprecedented surprise mingled with fear and joy stars sparkling mirabeau very niaid saint just robespierre camille des moulins wanton and a sun arise napoleon
he did not know where he stood
here coiled blinded by the brilliant lights
little by little when his astonishment had passed of the grew accustomed to this radiance he contemplated these deeds without dizziness be examined these personages without terror the revolution and the empire presented themselves luminous lu in perspective before his mind's eye he be held each of these groups of events and i then summed up in two tremendous facts the republic in the sovereignty of civil right restored to the masses the empire in the sovereignty of the french idea imposed on europe he beheld the grand figure of the people emerge from the revolution and the grand figure of france spring forth from the empire
he asserted in his conscience that all this has been good
what his dazzled state neglected in this his first far too synthetic estimation we do not think it necessary to point out here
it is the state of a mind on the march that we are recording
progress is not accomplished in one stage
that stated once for all in connection with what precedes as well as with what is to follow we continue
he then perceived that up to that moment he had comprehended his country no more than he had comprehended his father
he had not know neither the one of the other and a sort of voluntary night has obscured his eyes
now he saw and on the one hand he admired while on the other he adored
he was filled with regret and remorse and he reflected in despair that all he had in his soul could now be said only to the tomb
oh
if his father had still been in existence if he had still had him if god in his compassion and his goodness had permitted his father to be still among the living how he would have run how he would have precipitated himself how he would have cried to his father father
here i am
it is i
i have the same heart as thou
i am thy son
how he would have embraced that whitehead gather his hair in tears gazed upon his scar pressed his hands scored his garment missed his feet
oh
why had his father died so early before his time before the justice the love of his son had come to him
marius had a continual son in his heart which said to him every moment aids
at the same time he became more truly serious more truly grave more sure of his thought and his faith
at each instant gleams of the true came to complete his reason
an inward growth seemed to be in progress within min
he was conscious of a sort of natural enlargement which gave him two things that were new to him his father and his country
as everything opens when one has a key so he explained to himself that which he had hated me penetrates that which he had abhorred henceforth be plainly perceived the providential divine and human sense of the great things which he had been taught to detect and of the great men whom he had been instructed to curse
when he reflected on his former opinions which were but those of yesterday and which nevertheless seemed to him already so very ancient us grew indignant yet he smiled
from the rehabilitation of his father he naturally passed to the rehabilitation of napoleon
but the latter we will confess was not effected without labor
from his infancy he had been imbued with the judgments of the party icon bonaparte
now all the prejudices of the restoration all its interests all its instincts tended to disfigure napoleon
it exec rated him even more than it did robespierre
it had very cleverly turned to sufficiently good account the fatigue of the nation and the hatred of mothers
bonaparte had become an almost fabulous monster and in order to paint him to the imagination of the people which as we lately pointed out resembles the imagination of children the party of made him appear under all sorts of terrifying masks in succession from that which is terrible though it remains grandiose to that which is terrible and becomes grotesque from tiberius to the bugaboo
thus in speaking of bonaparte one was free to do not to puff up with laughter provided that hatred lay at the bottom
markus had never entertained about that man as he was called any other ideas in his mind
they had combined with the tenacity which existed on his nature
there was in him a headstrong little man who hates napoleon
on reading history on studying him especially in the documents and materials for history the veil which concealed napoleon from the eyes of marius was gradually rent
he caught a glimpse of something immense and he suspected that he had been received up to that moment on the score of bonaparte as an put all the rest each day he saw more distinctly and he set about mounting slowly step by step almost regretfully in the beginning then with intoxication and as though attracted by an irresistible fascination first the sombre steps then the vaguely illuminated steps at last the mg mini us and splendid steps of enthusiasm
one night he was alone in his little chamber near the roof
his candle was burning he was reading with his elbows resting on his table close to the open window
all sorts of reveries reached him from space and mingled with his thoughts
what a spectacle is the night
one hears full sounds without knowing whence they proceed one beholde jupiter which is twelve hundred times larger than the earth glowing like a firebrand the azureus black the stars shine it is formidable
he was perusing the bulletins of the grand army those heroics trop med penned on the field of battle there at intervals he beheld his father's name always the name of the emperor the whole of that great empire presented itself to him he felt a flood swelling and rising within him it seemed to him at moments that his father passed close to him like a breath and whispered in his ear he gradually got into a singular state he thought that he heard drums cannon trumpets the measured tread of battalions the dull and distant gallop is the cavalry from time to time his eyes were raised heavenward and gazed upon the colossal constellations as they gleamed in the measureless depths of space then they fell upon his book once more and there they beheld other colossal things moving confusedly
his heart contracted within him
he was in a transport trembling pay tung
all at once without himself knowing what was in him and what impulse he was obeying he sprang to his feet stretched both arms out of the window gazed intently into the gloom the silence the infinite darkness the eternal immensity and exclaimed long live the emperor
from that moment fort hall was over the ogre of corsica the usurper the tyrant the monster who was the lover of his own sister's the actor who took lessons of talks the poisoned of jaffa the tiger buona parte all this vanished and gave place in his mind to a vague and brilliant radiance in which shone at an inaccessible height the pale marble phantom of caesar
the emperor had been for his father only the well beloved captain who none admired for whom one sacrifices one's self he was something more to marius
he was the predestined constructor of the french group succeeding the roman group in the domination of the universe
he was a prodigious architect of a destruction the continued of charlemagne of louis xi
of henry iv
of richelieu of louis xiv
and of the committee of public safety having his spots no doubt his faults his crimes even being a man that is to say but august in his faults brilliant in his spots powerful in his crime
he was the predestined man who had forced all nations to say the great nation
he was better than that he was the very incarnation of france conquering europe by the sword which he grasped and the world by the light which he shed
markus was in bonaparte the dazzling spectre which will always rise up in the frontier and which will guard the future
despot but dictator a despot resulting from a republic and summing up a revolution
napoleon became for him the man people as jesus christ is the man box
it will be perceived that like all new converts to a religion his conversion intoxicated him he hurled himself headlong into adhesion and he went too far
his nature was so constructed once on the downward slope it was almost impossible for him to put on the drag
fanaticism for the sword took possession of him and complicated in his mind his enthusiasm for the idea
he did not perceive that along with genius and pell hell he was admitting force that is to say that he was installing in two compartments of his idolatry in the one hand that which is divine on the other than which is brutal
in many respects he had set about receiving himself otherwise
he admitted everything
there is a way of encountering error while on one's way to the truth
he had a violent sort of good faith which took everything in the pump
in the new path which he had entered on in judging the mistakes of the old regime as in measuring the glory of napoleon he neglected the attenuating circumstances
at all events a tremendous step had been taken
where he had formerly be held the fall of the monarchy he now saw the advent of france
his or mentation had changed
what had been mideast became the west
he had turned squarely round
all these revolutions were accomplished within him without his family obtaining an inkling of the case
when during this mysterious labor he had entirely shed his old bourbon and ultra skin when he had cast off the aristocrat the jacobite and the royalist when he had become thoroughly a revolutionist profoundly democratic and republican he went to an engraved on the quai des or be free and ordered a hundred cards bearing this name lebaron may its long mercy
this was only the strictly logical consequence of the change which had taken place in him a change in which everything gravitated round his father
only as he did not know anyone and could not sow his cards with any porter he put them in his pocket
by another natural consequence in proportion as he drew nearer to his father to the latter's memory and to the things for which the colonel had fought five and twenty years before he receded from his grandfather
we have long ago said that m
ville norm and's temper did not please him
there already existed between them all the dissonance's of the brave young man and the frivolous old man
the gayety offer inte shocks and exasperated the melancholy of werther
so long as the same political opinions and the same ideas had been common to them both marius had met m
gillen of m. and the reasons bridge
when the bridge fell an abyss was formed
and then over and above all markus experienced in utter a bit impulses to revolt when he reflected that it was m.
ville norm and who had from a flood motives torn him ruthlessly from the colonel thus depriving the father of the child and the child of the father
by dint of pity for his father marius had nearly arrived at a version for his grandfather
nothing of this sort however was betrayed on the exterior as we have already said
only hebrew colder and colder laconic at meals and rare in the house
when his aunt scolded him for it he was very gentle and alleged his studies his lectures the examinations etc.
as a pretext
his grandfather never departed from his infallible diagnosis in love
i know all about it
from time to time marius absentee himself
where is it that he goes off like this
said his aunt
on one of these trips which were always very brief he went to mont vermeil in order to obey the injunction which his father had left him and he sought the old sergeant to waterloo the innkeeper the barrier
the barrier had failed the inn was closed and no one knew what had become of jim
marius was away from the house for four days on this quest
he is getting decidedly wild said his grandfather
they thought they had noticed that he wore something in his breast under his shirt which was attached to his neck by a black ribbon
chapter vii some petticoat we have mentioned a lancer
he was a great grand nephew of m
ville normand on the paternal side who led a garrison life outside the family and far from the domestic hearth
lieutenant the ovule ville norm and fulfilled all the conditions required to make what is called a fine officer
he had a lady's waist a victorious manner of trailing his sword and of twirling his mustache in a book
he visited paris der graf sly and so rarely that marius had never seen him
the cousins knew each other only by name
we think we have said that the ovule was the favorite of aunt ville norm and who preferred him because she did not see him
not seeing people permits one to attribute to the mail possible perfections
one morning mademoiselle ville norm and the elder returned to her apartment as much disturbed as her pl acidity was capable of allowing
marius had just asked his grandfather's permission to take a little trip adding that he meant to set out that very evening
go
had been his grandfather's reply and m
ville norman chad added in an aside as he raised his eyebrows to the top of his forehead here he is passing the night out again
mademoiselle gillen or hand had ascended to her chamber greatly puzzled and on the staircase had dropped this edc is mation this is too much
and this interrogation bug where is it that he goes
she espied some adventure of the heart more or less illicit a woman in the shadows rendezvous a mystery and she would not have been sorry to thrust her spectacles into the affair
tasting a mystery resembles getting the first flavor of a scandal sainted souls do not detect this
there is some curiosity about scandal in the secret compartments of bigotry
so she was the prey of a vague appetite for learning a history
in order to get rid of this curiosity which agitated her a little beyond her songs he took refuge in her talents and set about scallop ing with one layer of cotton after another one of those embroideries of the empire and the restoration in which there are numerous cartwheels
the work was clumsy the worker cross
she had been seated at this for several hours when the door opened
mademoiselle fille norm and raised her nose
lieutenant theory of stood before her making the regulation salute
she uttered a cry of delight
one may be old one may be a prude one may be pious one may be an aunt but it is always agreeable to see a lancer enter one's chamber
you here theory of
she exclaimed
on my way through town sunt
embrace me
here goes
said the ovule
and he kissed her
aunt ville norm and went to her writing desk and opened it
you will remain with us a week at least
i leave this very evening aunt
it is not possible
mathematically
remain my little the ovule i beseech you
my heart says' yes' but my orders say' no
' the matter is simple
they are changing our harrison we have been at melun we are being transferred to gallion
it is necessary to pass through paris in order to get from the old post to the new one
i said' i am going to see my aunt
' here is something for your trouble
and she put ten louis into his hand
for my pleasure you mean to say my dear aunt
the ovule kissed her again and she experienced the joy of having some of the skin scratches from her neck by the braiding's on his uniform
are you making the journey on horseback with your regiment
she asked him
no aunt
i wanted to see you
i have special permission
my servant is taking my horse i am travelling by diligence
and by the way i want to ask you something
what is it
is my cousin marius long march travelling so too
how do you know that
said his aunt suddenly pricked to the quick with a lively curiosity
on my arrival i went to the diligence to engage my seat in the coupe
well
a traveller had already come to engage a seat in the imperial
i saw his name on the card
what name
marius pont merch
the wicked fellow
exclaimed his aunt
ah
your cousin is not a steady la'd like yourself
to think that he is to pass the night in a diligence
just as i am going to do
but you it is your duty in his case it is wildness
body
said the ovule
here an event occurred to mademoiselle ville norm and the elder an idea struck her
if she had been a man she would have slapped her brow
shea post room ized the ovule are you aware whether your cousin knows you
no
i have seen him but he has never deigned to notice me
so you are going to travel together
us in the imperial i in the coupe
where does this diligence run
to an delta
then that is where marius is going
unless like myself he should stop on the way
i get down at vernon in order to take the branch coach for gallion
i know nothing of marius' plan of travel
marius
what an ugly name
what possessed them to make him marius
while you at least are called the ovule
i would rather be called alfred said the officer
listen the ovule
i am listening aunt
pay attention
i am paying attention
you understand
yes
well marius absent's himself
eh
eh
he travels
ah
ah
he spends the night out
oh
on
we should like to know what there is behind all this
the ovule replied with the composure of a man of bronze some petticoat or other
and with that inward laugh which denotes certainty he added a lass
that is evident exclaimed his aunt who thought she heard m
bill rnorm and speaking and who felt her conviction become irresistible at that word gillette accentuated in almost the very same fashion by the grand uncle and the grand nephew
she resumed do is a favor
follow marius a little
he does not know you it will be easy
since a laws there is try to get a sight of her
you must write us the tale
it will amuse his grandfather
the ovule had no excessive taste for this sort of spying but he was much touched by the ten louis and he thought he saw a chance for a possible sequel
he accepted the commission and said as you please aunt
and he added in an aside to himself here i am a duenna
mademoiselle ville norm and embraced him
you are not the man to play such pranks the ovule
you obey discipline you are the slave of orders you are a man of scruples and duty and you would not quit your family to go and see a creature
the lander made the pleased grimace of cartouche when praised for his probity
marius on the evening following this dialogue mounted the diligence without suspecting that he was watches
as for the watcher the first thing he did was to fall asleep
his slumber was complete and conscientious
argus snored all night long
at daybreak the conductor of the diligence shouted vernon
delay of vernon
travellers for vernon
and lieutenant the ovule woke
good he growled still half asleep this is where i get out
then as his memory cleared by degrees the effect of waking he recalled his aunt the ten louis and the account which he had undertaken to render of the deeds and proceedings of marius
this set him to laughing
perhaps he is no longer in the coach he thought as here buttoned the waistcoat of his undress uniform
he may have stopped at poissy he may have stopped at friel if he did not get out at meylan he may have got out at msn rss unless he got out at dolls house or if he did not go on as far as pact with the choice of turning to the left at evreux or to the right at la roche guy on
run after him aunty
what the devil ami to write to that good old soul
at that moment a pair of black trousers descending from the imperial made its appearance at the window of the coupe
can that he marius
said the lieutenant
it was marius
a little peasant girl all entangled with the horses and the postilion's at the end of the vehicle was offering flowers to the travellers
give your ladies flowers
she cried
marius approached her and purchased the finest flowers in her flat basket
come now said the ovule leaping down from the coupe this piqued my curiosity
who the deuce is he going to carry those flowers to
she must be a splendidly handsome woman for so find a bouquet
i want to see her
and no longer in pursuance of orders but from personal curiosity like dogs who hunt on their own account he set out to follow marius
marius paid no attention to the ovule
elegant women descended from the diligence he did not glance at them
he seemed to see nothing around him
he is pretty deeply in love
thought the ovule
marius directed his steps towards the church
capital said theory is to himself
rendezvous seasoned with a bit of mass are the best sort
nothing is so exquisite as a noble which passes over the good god's head
on arriving at the church marius did not enter it but skirted the apse
he disappeared behind one of the angles of the apse
the rendezvous is appointed outside said the ovule
let's have a look at the laws
and he advanced on the tips of his boots towards the corner which marius had turned
on arriving there he halted in amazement
marius with his forehead clasped in his hands was kneeling upon the grass on a grave
he had strewn his bouquet there
at the extremity of the grave on a little swelling which marked the head there stood a cross of black wood with this name in white letters colonel baron pont mercy
marius' sons were audible
the laws was a grave
chapter viii marble against granite it was higher that marius had come on the first occasion of his ab sending himself from paris
it was higher that he had come every time that m
gillem of jane had said he is sleeping out
lieutenant the ovule was absolutely put out of countenance by this unexpected encounter with a sepulchre he experienced a singular and disagreeable sensation which he was incapable of analyzing and which was composed of respect for the tomb mingled with respect for the colonel
he retreated leaving marius alone in the cemetery and there was discipline in this retreat
death appeared to him with large epaulets and he almost made the military salute to him
not knowing what to write to his aunt he decided not to write a tall and it is probable that nothing would have resulted from the discovery made by the ovule as to the love affairs of marius if by one of those mysterious arrangements which are so frequent in chance the scene at vernon had not had an almost immediate counter shock at paris
marius returned from vernon on the third day in the middle of the morning descended at his grandfather's door and wearied by the two nights spent in the diligence and feeling the need of repairing his loss of sleep by an hour at the swimming school he mounted rapidly to his chamber took merely time enough to throw off his travelling cost and the black ribbon which he wore round his neck and sent off to the bath
m
ville norm and who had risen be times like all old men in good health had heard his entrance and had made haste to climb as quickly as his old pets permitted the stairs to the upper story where marius lived in order to embrace him and to question him while so doing and to find out where he had been
but the youth had taken less time to descend than the old man had to ascend and when rather ville norm and entered the attic marius was no longer there
the bed had not been disturbed and on the new layout spread but not defiantly the great coat and the black ribbon
i like this better said m
ville normand
and a moment later he made his entrance into the salon where mademoiselle ville norm and was already seated busily embroidering her cartwheels
the entrance was a triumphant one
m
gillen or hand held in one hand the great coat and in the other the neck ribbon and exclaimed victory
we are about to penetrate the mystery
we are going to learn the most minute details we are going to la your finger on the debauched ies of purely true if
here we have the romance itself
i have the portrait
in fact a case of black sha green resembling a medallion portrait was suspended from the ribbon
the old man took this case and gazed at it for some time without opening it with that air of enjoyment rapture and wrath with which a poor hungry fellow he holds an admirable dinner which is not for him pass under his very nose
for this evidently is a portrait
i know all about such things
that is worn tenderly on the heart
how stupid they are
some abominable bright that will make us shudder probably
young men have such bad taste nowadays
let us see father said the old spinster
the case opened by the pressure of a spring
they found in it nothing but a carefully folded paper
from the same to the same said m
ville norm and bursting with laughter
i know what it is
a bullet doux
aj
let us read it
said the quit
and she put on her spectacles
they unfolded the paper and read as follows for my son
the emperor made me a baron on the battlefield of waterloo
since the restoration disputes my right to this title which i purchased with my blood my son shall take it and bear it
that he will be worthy of it is a matter of course
rbd feelings of father and daughter can not be described
they felt chilled as by the breath of a death's head
they did not exchange a word
only m
ville norm and said in a low voice and as though speaking to himself it is the slasher's handwriting
the aunt examined the paper turned it about in all directions then put it back in its case
at the same moment a little of long packet enveloped in blue paper fell from one of the pockets of the great coat
mademoiselle gillen or hand picked it up and unfolded the blue paper
it contained marius' hundred cards
she handed one of them tom
ville norm and who read lebaron marius pont mercy
the old man rang the bell
nicole the same
m
ville norm and took the ribbon the case and the cost flung them all on the floor in the middle of the room and said carry those dude away
a full hour passed in the most profound silence
the old man and the old spinster had seated themselves with their backs to eachother and we're thinking each on his own account the same things in all probability
at the expiration of this hours in triple norm and said a pretty state of things
a few moments later marius made his appearance
he entered
even before he had crossed the threshold he saw his grandfather holding one of his own cards in his hand and on catching sight of him the latter exclaimed with his air of bourgeois and grinning superiority which was something crushing well
well
well
well
well
so you are a bag on now
i present you my compliments
what is the meaning of this
marius reddened slightly and replied it means that i am the son of my father
m
ville norm and ceased to laugh and said harshly i am your father
my father retorted marius with downcast eyes and a severe air was a humble and heroic man who served the republic and france gloriously who was great in the greatest history that men have ever made who lived in the bivouac for a quarter of a century beneath grapes hot and bullets in snow and mud by day beneath rain at night who captured two flags who received twenty wounds who died forgotten and abandoned and who never committed but one mistake which was to love too fondly two in grades his country and myself
this was more than m
ville norm and could gear to hear
at the word republic he rose or to speak more correctly he sprang to his feet
every word that marius had just uttered produced on the visage of the old royalist the effect of the puffs of air from a forge upon a blazing brand
from a full tue he had turned red from red purple and from purple flame colored
marius
he cried
abominable child
i do not know what your father was
i do not wish to know
i know nothing about that and i do not know him
but what i do know is that there never was anything but scoundrels among those men
they were all rascals assassinated caps thieves
i say all
i say all
i know not one
i say all
do you hear me marius
see here you are no more sharon than my slippery s
they were all bandits in the service of robespierre
all who served buona parts were brigands
they were all traitors who betrayed betrayed betrayed their legitimate king
all cowards who fled before the prussians and the english at waterloo
that is what is links
whether monsieur your father comes in that category i do not know
i am sorry for it so much the worse your humble servant
in his turn it was marius who was the fire brand and m
ville norm and who was the bellows
marius quivered in every limb he did not know what would happen next his brain was on fire
he was the priest who he holds all his sacred waters cast to the wines the fakir who he holds a passerby spit upon his idol
it could not be that such things had been uttered in his presence
what was metodo
his father had just been trampled underfoot and stamped upon in his presence but by enom
by his grandfather
how waste to avenge the one without out raging the other
it was impossible for him to insult his grandfather and it was equally impossible for him to leave his father in avenged
on the one hand was a sacred grave on the other hoary locks
he stood there for several moments staggering as though intoxicated with all this whirlwind dashing through his head then he raised his eyes based fixedly at his grandfather and cried in a voice of thunder down with the bourbons and that great bogota louis xviii
louis xviii
had been dead for four years but it was all the same to him
the old man who has been crimson turned whiter than his hair
he wheeled round toward xx by storm
le duc de berry which stood on the chimney piece and made a profound now with a sort of peculiar majesty
then he paced twice a kosky and in silence from the fireplace to the window and from the window to the fireplace traversing the whole length of the room and making the polished floor cream as though he had been a stone statue walking
on his second turn he bent over his daughter who was watching this encounter with the stupefied air of an antiquated lamb and said to her with a smile that was almost calma baron like this gentleman and a bourgeois like myself can not remain under the same roof
and drawing himself up all at once pallid trembling terrible with his brow rendered more lofty by the terrible radiance of wrath be extended his arm towards marius and shouted to him be off
marius left the house
on the following day m
gulls norm and said to his daughter you will send sixty pistols's every six months to that blood drinker and you will never mention his name to me
having an immense reserve fund of wrath to get rid of and not knowing what to do with it he continued to address his daughter as you instead of thou for the next three months
marius on his side had gone forth in indignation
there was one circumstance which it must be admitted aggravated his exasperation
there are always party fatalities of the sort which complicate domestic dramas
they augment the grievances in such cases although in reality the wrong date not increased by them
while carrying marius' dude precipitate it to his chamber at his grandfather's command nicolette had inadvertently left a'll probably on the attic staircase which was dark that medallion of black chat teen which contained the paper penned by the colonel
neither paper nor case would afterwards be found
marius was convinced that monsieur ville normand from that day forth he never alluded to him otherwise had flung his father's testament in the fire
he knew by heart the few lines which the colonel had written and consequently nothing was lost
but the paper the writing that sacred relic all that was his very heart
what had been done with it
marius had taken his departure without saying whither he was going and without knowing where with thirty france his watch and a few clothes in a handbag
he had entered a hackney coach has engaged it by the hour and had directed his course at haphazard towards the latin quarter
what was to become of marius
book fourth
the friends of the abc chapter ix group which barely missed becoming historic at that epoch which was to all appearances in different a certain revolutionary quiver was vaguely current
breaths which had started forth from the depths of' and' were in the air
youth was on the point may the reader pardon is the word of moulting
people were undergoing a transformation almost without being conscious of it through the movement of the age
the needle which move around the compass also moved in souls
each person was taking that step in advance which he was bound to take
the royalists were becoming liberals liberals were turning democrats
it was a flood tide complicated with a thousand ebb movements the peculiarity of ebbs is to create inter mixtures hence the combination of very singular ideas people scored both napoleon and liberty
we are making history here
these were the mirages of that period
opinions traverse phases
vol haitian royal i am a quaint variety had a no less singular sequel bona p artist liberalism
other groups of minds seed more serious
in that direction they sounded principles they attached themselves to the right
they grew enthusiastic for the absolute they caught glimpses of infinite realizations the absolute by its very rigidity urges spirits towards the sky and causes them to float in illimitable space
there is nothing like dogma for bringing forth dreams
and there is nothing like dreams for engendering the future
utopia to eat flesh and blood tomorrow
these advanced opinions had a double foundation
a beginning of mystery menaced the established order of things which was suspicious and underhand
a sign which was revolutionary to the highest degree
the second thoughts of power meet the second thoughts of the populace in the mine
the incubation of insurrections gives the retort to the premeditation of couped' etat
there did not as yet exist in france any of those vast underlying organizations like the term antigens by brand italian carbon a risk but here and there there were dark undermining's which were in process of throwing offshoots
the four out des as being outline data is there existed at paris among other affiliations of that nature the society of the friends of the abc
what were these friends of the abc
a society which had for its object apparently the ecj cation of children in reality the elevation of man
they declared themselves the friends of the abc the aba i see the debased that is to say the people
they wished to elevate the people
it was spun which we should do wrong to smile at
pins are sometimes serious factors in politics witness the cast fat us add astra which made a general of the army of garces fitness bad barker barberini fitness ties petrus et super handle team etc.
etc.
the friends of the abc were not numerous it was a secret society in the state of embryo we might almost say a coterie of coterie sender in heroes
they assembled in paris in two localities near the fish market in a wine shop called for in the on which more will be heard later on and near the pantheon in a little cafe on the rue saint michel called the cafe husain now torn down the first of these meeting places was close to the working man the second to the students
the assemblies of the friends of the abc were usually held in a backroom of the cafe husain
this hall which was tolerably remote from the cave with which it was connected by an extremely long corridor had two windows and an exit with a private stairway on the little guedes free
there they smoked and drank and gambler and laughed
there they conversed in very loud tones about everything and in whispers of other things
an old map of france under the republic was nailed to the walls sign quite sufficient to excite the suspicion of a police agent
the greater part of the friends of the abc were students who were on cordial terms with the working classes
here are the names of the principal ones
they belong in a certain measure to history enjo orascom be ferre jean proud a pre be jolly court eyes aba model lesbo work aigle join grant aire
these young men formed a sort of family through the bond of friendship
all with the exception of lainie were from the south
illustration friends of the abc band friends this was a remarkable group
it vanished in the invisible depths which lie behind us
at the point of this drama which we have now reached it will not perhaps be superfluous to throw a day of light upon these youthful heads before the reader he holds them plunging into the shadow of a tragic adventure
enjoi rss whose name we have mentioned first of all the reader shall see why later on was an only son and wealthy
enjoi gas was a charming young man who was capable of being terrible
he was an be locally handsome
he was a savage antinous
one would have said to see the pensive thoughtfulness of his glance that he had already in some previous state of existence traversed the revolutionary apocalypse
he possessed the tradition of it as though he had been a witness
he was acquainted with all the minute details of the great affair
a pontifical and warlike natures singular thing in a youth
he was an officiating priest and a man of war from the immediate point of view a soldier of the democracy above the contemporary movement the priest of the ideal
his eyes were deep his lies a little red his lower lip was thick and easily became disdainful his brow was lofty
a great deal of brow in a face is like a great deal of horizon in a view
like certain young men at the beginning of this century and the end of the last who became illustrious at an early age he was endowed with excessive youth and was as rosy as a young girl although subject to hours of pallor
already a man he still seemed a child
his two and twenty years appeared to be but seventeen he was serious it did not seem as though he were aware there was on earth a thing called woman
he had but one passion the right but one thought to overthrow the obstacle
on mount aventine he would have been gracchus in the convention he would have been saint just
he hardly saw the rose she ignored spring he did not hear the carol king of the birds the bare throat of eva she would have moved him no more than it would have moved aristo rely on me like harm or just bought flowers good for nothing except to conceal the sword
he was severe in his enjoyments
he chaste it dropped his eyes before everything which was not the republic
he was the marble lover of liberty
his speech was harshly inspired and had the thrill of a hymn
he was subject to unexpected outbursts of soul
woe to the love affair which should have rocked itself beside him
if any g rosette of the place cambrai of the rue saint jean de beauvais seeing that face of a youth escaped from college that page's mien those long golden lashes those blue eyes that hair following in the wind those rosy cheeks those fresh lips those exquisite teeth had conceived an appetite for that complete aurora and had tried her beauty one nj old as an astounding and terrible glance would have promptly shown her the abyss and would have taught her not to confound the mighty cherub or ezekiel with the gallant cherubini of beaumarchais
by the side of enjoi rss who represented the logic of the revolution combed were represented its philosophy
between the logic of the revolution and its philosophy there exists this difference that it's logic may end in war whereas it's philosophy can end only in peace
conned were complemented and rectified eg no less
he was less lofty but broader
he desired to pour into all kinds the extensive pdif copies of general idea she said revolution but civilization and around the mountain peak be opened out a vast view of the blue sky
the revolution was more adapted for breathing with combe ferre than with en jul rss
em hold as expressed its divine right and combe ferreira natural right
the first attached himself to robespierre the second confined himself to condorcet
comber we deliver the life of all the rest of the world more than did enjoi rss
if it had been granted to these two young men to attain to history the one would have been the just the other the wiseman
enjoi race as the more virile com becerra the more humane
homo and for that was the exact effect of their different shades
com be ferre was as gentle as enjoi raw was severe through natural whiteness
he loved the word citizen but he preferred the word man
he would gladly have said hombre like the spanish
he read everything went to the theatres attended the courses of public lecturers learned the polarization of light from arago grew enthusiastic over a lesson in which geoffrey sainte hi pairs explained the double function of the external carotid artery and the internal the one which makes the face and the one which makes the brain he kept up with what was going on followed science step by step compared saint simon with fourier deciphered hieroglyphics broke the pebble which he found and reasoned on geology free from memory a silkworm moth pointed out the faulty french in the dictionary of the academy studied out segur and deleuze affirmed nothing not even miracles denied nothing not even ghosts turned over the files of the moniteur reflected
he declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster and busied himself with educational questions
he desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level at coining science at putting ideas into circulation at increasing the mind in youthful persons and he feared lest the present poverty of method the papyri news from a literary point of view confined to two or three centuries called classic the tyrannical dogmatism of official pedants scholastic prejudices and routines should end by converting our college q into artificial oyster beds
he was learned a purist exact a graduate of the polytechnic a close student and at the same time thoughtful even to chimaera ask his friends said
he believed in all dreams railroads the suppression of suffering inch i turn ical operations the fixing of images in the dark chamber the electric telegraph the steering of balloons
moreover he was not much alarmed by the citadel's erected against the human mind in every direction by superstition despotism and prejudice
he was one of those who think that science will eventually turn the position
enjoi gas was a chief combe ferre was a guide
one would have liked to fight under the one and to march behind the other
it is not that combe ferre was not capable of fighting he did not refuse a hand to hand combat with the obstacle and to attack it by main force and espoo sively but it suited him better to bring the human race into accord with its destiny gradually by means of education the inculcation of axioms the prom ligation of positive laws and between two lights his preference was rather for illumination than for conflagration
a conflagration can create an aurora no doubt but why not await the dawn
a volcano illuminates but daybreak furnishes a still better illumination
possibly combe ferre preferred the whiteness of the beautiful to the blaze of the sublime
a light troubled by smoke progress purchased at the expense of violence only half satisfied this tender and serious spirit
the headlong precipitation of a people into the truths' terrified him nevertheless stagnation was still more repulsive to him in it be detected putrefaction and death on the whole he preferred scum to miasma and he preferred the torrent to the cesspool and the falls of niagara to the lake of mont faucon
in short be desired neither half not taste
while his tumult ious friends captivated by the absolute adored and invoked splendid revolutionary adventures club de arte was inclined to let progress good progress take its own course he may have been cold but he was pure methodical but irreproachable phlegmatic buy imperturbable

every time that he passed the law school which rarely happened he buttoned up his frock coat the paper it had not yet been invented and took hygienic precautions

in his lectures he expire subjects for ballads and in his professors occasions for caricature

in reality he had a penetrating mind and was more of a thinker than appeared to view
he served as a connecting link between the friends of the anc and other still in organized groups which were destined to take form later on
in this conclave of young heads there was one bald member
the marquise's carat whom louis xviii
made a rule for having assisted him to enter a hackney coach on the day when he emigrated was wont to relate that in on his return to france as the king was disembarking at calais a man handed him a petition
what is your request
said the king
sites post office
what is your name
l' aigle
the king frowned glanced at the signature of the petition and beheld the name written this pestle
this non bono parts orthography touched the king and he began to smile
site resumed the man with the petition i had for ancestors keeper of the hounds surnames league ules
this surname furnished my name
i am called league ules by contraction pestle and by corruptionl' aigle
this caused the king to smile broadly
later on he gave the man the posting office of meaux either intentionally or accidentally
the bald member of the group was the son of this lesbo for perle and he signed himself legless meaux
as an abbreviation his companions called him bosquet
bossier was a gay but unlucky fellow
his specialty was not to succeed in anything
as an offset he laughed at everything
at five and twenty he was bald
his father had ended by owning a house and a field by the the son had made haste to lose that house and field in a bad speculation
he had nothing left
he possessed knowledge and with it all he did miscarried

he was not easily astonished because for him an accident was what he had foreseen he took his bad luck serenely and smiled at the reading of fate like a person who is listening to pleasantries
he was poor but his fund of good humor was inexhaustible
he soon reached his last so i never his last burst of laughter
when adversity entered his door she saluted this old acquaintance cordially he tapped all catastrophes in the stomach he was familiar with fatality to the point of calling it by its nickname good day gulf non he said to it
these persecutions of fate had rendered him inventive
he was full of resources
he had no money but he found means when it seemed good to him to indulge in unbridled extravagance
one night he went so far as to eat a hundred francs in a supper with a wench which inspired him to make this memorable remark in the midst of the orgy pull off my boots you give louis jade
bossier was slowly directing his steps towards the profession of a lawyer he was pursuing his law studies after the manner of bw hotel
bosquet had not much domicile sometimes none at all
he lodged now with one now with another most often with joly
holy was studying medicine
he was two years younger than bosquet
holy was the mapa del mar inside junior
what he had won in medicine was to be more of an invalid than a doctor
at three and twenty he thought himself a vale tudo marian and passed his life in inspecting his tongue in the mirror
he affirmed that man becomes magnetic like a needle and in his chamber be placed his bed with its head to the south and the foot to the north so that at night the circulation of his blood might not be interfered with by the great electric current of the globe
during thunderstorms he felt his pulse
otherwise he was the gayest of the mall
all these young man is calling merry incoherence's lives in harmony together and the result was an eccentric and agreeable being whom his comrades who were prodigal of winged consonants called no lilly
you may fly away on the fourl' s jean proud aide said to him
holy had struck of touching his nose with the top of his cane which is an indication of a sagacious mind
all these young men who suffered so greatly and shoot the whole can only be discussed seriously held the same religion progress
all were the direct sons of the french revolution
the most giddy of them became solemn when they pronounced that date'
their fathers in the flesh had been either royalists doctrinaire's in matters not what this confusion anterior to themselves who were young did not concern them at all the pure blood of principle ran in their veins
they attached themselves without intermediate shades to incorruptible right and absolute duty
affiliated and initiates they sketched out the ideal underground
among all these glowing hearts and thoroughly convinced minds there was one sceptic
how can whether e
by juxtaposition
this sceptic's name was grant wire and he was in the habit of signing himself with this feb mar
grant site was a man who took goods are not to believe in anything
moreover he was one of the students who had learned the most during their course at paris he knew that the best coffee was to be mad at the case own blog and the best billiards at the cafe voltaire that good cakes and passes were to be found at the ermitage on the boulevard du maine's patch cocked chickens at mother sauget's excellent may elites at the barriers de la dinette and a certain thin white wine at the barrier edu compat
he knew the best place for everything in addition boxing and foot fencing and some dances and he was a thorough single stick player
he was a tremendous drinker to boot
he was inordinately homely the prettiest boot stitcher of that day of man pussy engaged with his home lines's pronounced sentence on him as follows grant site is impossible but grant site's fat ulty was not to be disconcerted
he stared tenderly and fixedly at all women with the air of saying to them all it i only chose
and of trying to make his comrades believe that he was in general demand
all those words rights of the people rights of man the social contract the french revolution the republic democracy humanity civilization re logo on progress came very near to signifying nothing whatever to grant site
he smiled at the h
scepticism that varies of the intelligence had not left him a single whole idea
he lived with irony
this was his axiom there is but one certainty my full glass
he sneered at all devotion in all parties the father as well as the brother robespierre junior as well as iii zero lies
they are greatly in advance to be dead he exclaimed
he said if the crucifix there is a gibbet which has been a success

by his character
a phenomenon which is often observable
a sceptic who adheres to a believer is as simple as the law of complementary colors
that which we lack attracts us
no one loves the light like the blind man
the dwarf adores the drum major
the road always has his eyes fixed in heaven
why
in order to watch the bird in its flight
grant site in whom writhed doubt loved to watch faith soar in enjoi rss
he had need of enjoi rss
that chaste healthy firm upright hard candid nature charmed him without his being clearly aware of it and without the idea of explaining it to himself having occurred to him
he admired his opposite by instinct
his soft yielding dislocated sickly shapeless ideas attached themselves town no less as to a spinal column
his moral backbone leaned on that firmness
grant site in the presence of enjoi rss became someone once more
he was himself moreover composed of two elements which were to all appearance incompatible
he was ironical and cordial
his indifference loved
his mind could get along with our belief but his heart could not get along with our friendship
a profound contradiction for an affection is a conviction
his nature was this constituted

he had the air of scary at icon a vacation he carried nothing but his revert however
he was staring at the place saint michel
to lean one's back against a thing is equivalent to lying down while standing erect which attitude is not hated by thinkers
pair of de meaux was pondering without melancholy over a little misadventure which had befallen him two days previously at the law school and which had modified his personal plans for the future plans which were rather indistinct in any case
're very does not prevent a cab from passing by nor the dreamer from taking note of that can
lainie dem faux whose eyes were straying about in a sort of diffuse lounging perceived a thwart his son jan bulis ma two wheeled vehicle proceeding through the place at a foot pads and apparently in indecision
for whom was this cabriolet
why was it driving at a walk

in it beside the coachman's at a young man and in front of the young man lay a rather bulky handbag
the bag displayed to passers by the following name inscribed in large black letters on a card which was seen to the stuff marius pont mercy
this name caused lainie to change his attitude
he drew himself up and hurled this apostrophe at the young man in the cabriolet monsieur marius pont mercy
the cabriolet thus addressed came to a halt
the young man who also seemed deeply buried in thought raised his eyes key
said he
you are m.

i was looking for you resumed lainie de meaux
how do
demanded marius for it was he in fact he had just quitted his grandfather's and had before him a face which he now be held for the first time
i do not know you
neither do i know you responded l aigle
marius thought he had encountered away the beginning of a justification in the open street
he was not in a very good humor at the moment
he groaned
lainie de meaux went on in perturb ably you were not at the school day before yesterday
that is possible
that is certain
you are a student
demanded marius
yes sir
like yourself
day before yesterday i entered the school by chance
you know one does have such freaks sometimes
the professor was just calling the tool
you are not unaware that they are very ridiculous on such occasions
at the third call unanswered your name is erased from the list
sixty france in the gulf
marius began to listen
it was blond gay who was making the call
you know blonde au he has a very pointed and very malicious nose and he delights to scent out the absent
he slyly began with the letter p
i was not listening not being compromised by that letter
the call was not going badly
no erasures the universe was present
blonde au was grieved
usaid to myself' blonde au my love you will not get the very smallest sort of an execution today
' all at once blonde au calls' marius pont mercy
' no one answers

' and he takes his pen
monsieur i have bowels of compassion
i said to myself hastily' here's a brave fellow who is going to get scratched out

' at that moment blonde au dipped his pen in all black with erasures in the ink cast his yellow eyes round the audience room and repeated for the third time' markus pont mercy
' i replied' present
' this is why you were not crossed off
monsieur
said marius
and why i was added lainie de meaux
i do not understand you said marius
lainie resumed nothing is more simple
i was close to the desk to reply and close to the door for the purpose of flight
the professor gazed at me with a certain intensity
all of a sudden blonde ai who must be the malicious nose alluded to by boileau skilled to the letter l
l is my letter
i am from meaux and my name is pestle
l' aigle
interrupted marius what fine name
monsieur blonde au came to this fine name and called' l aigle
' i reply' present
' then blonde au gazes at me with the gentleness of a tiger and says to me' if you are long mercy you are not lainie
's phrase which has asia obliging aid for you but which was lugubrious only for me
that said he crossed me off
marius exclaimed i am mortified air first of all interposed pain leiden and permission form balm blinc eau in a few phrases of deeply felt full glum

in future be exact
i really beg you a thousand pardons
do not expose your neighbor to the danger of having his name erased again
i am extremely sorry i aigle burst out laughing
and i am delighted
i was on the brink of becoming a lawyer
this erasure saves me
i renounce the triumphs of the bar
i shall not defend the widow and i shall not attack the orphan
no more tobago more stage

it is to you that i am indebted for it monsieur pont mercy
i intend to pay a solemn call of thanks upon you
where do you live
in this can said marius
a sign of opulence retorted lainie calmly
i congratulate you
you have the r extent of nine thousand francs per annum
at that moment source trac emerged from the cafe
marius smiled sadly
i have paid this went for the last two hours and i aspire to get rid of it but there is a sort of history attached to it and idon't know where to go
come to my placed it said courts trac
i have the priority observed lainie but i have no home
hold your tongue bosquet said voyer straw
bossier said marius but i thought that your name was l aigle
dem eaux de loi del' aigle by metaphor bosquet
source trac entered the cab
coachman said he hotel de la porte saint jacques
and that very evening marius found himself installed in a chamber of the hotel de la porte saint jacques side by side with source trac
chapter iii marius' astonishment's in a few days marius had become courts geac's friend
youth is the season for prompt welding and the rapid healing of scars
marius breathed freely in source urac's society a decidedly new thing for him
source grasp html questions to him
he did not even think of such a thing
at that are faces disclose everything on the spot
words are superfluous
there are young men of whom it can be said that their countenances chatter
one looks at them and one knows they
one morning however source trac abruptly addressed this interrogs tion to him by the way have you any political opinions
the idea
said marius almost affronted by the question
what are you
a democrat non alarmist
the gray his or are assured rat said source head
on the following day source trac introduced marius at the cafe husain
then he whispered in his ear with a smile i must give you your entry to the revolution
and he led him to the hall of the friends of the abc
he presented him to the other comrades saying this simple word which marius did not understand a pupil
marius had fallen into a wasps' best of wits
however although he was silent and brave he was nonetheless both winged and armed
marius up to that time solitary and inclined to soliloquy and to a sides both by habit and by taste was a little fluttered by this covey of young men around him
all these various initiatives solicited his attention at once and pulled him about
the tumultuous movements of these kinds at liberty and at work set his ideas in a whirl
sometimes in his trouble they flew so far from him that he had difficulty in recovering them
he heard them talk of philosophy of literature of art of history of religion in unexpected fashion
he caught glimpses of strange aspects and as he did not place them in proper perspective he was not altogether sure that it was not chaos that he grasped
on abandoning his grandfather's opinions for the opinions of his father he had supposed himself fixed he now suspected with uneasiness and without daring to show it to himself that he was not
the angle at which he saw everything began to be displaced a new
a certain oscillation detail the horizons of his brains in motion
an odd internal upsetting
he almost suffered from it
it seemed as though there were no consecrated things for those young men
marius heard singular propositions on every sort of subject which embarrassed his still timid mind
a theatre poster presented itself adorned with the title of a tragedy from the ancient repertory called class is down with tragedy dear to the bourgeois
cried bw hotel
and marius heard combe ferre reply you are wrong bag or fi
the bourgeoisie loves tragedy and the bourgeoisie must be left at peace on that score
be signed tragedy has a reason for its existence and i am not one of those who by order of aeschylus contest its right to existence
there are rough outline signature there are in creation ready made parodies a beam which is not a beak wings which are not wings bills which are not tools laws which are not pass a cry of pain which aroused a desire to laugh there is the duck
now since poultry exists by the side of the bird i do not see why classic tragedy should not exist in the face of antique tragedy
or chance decreed that marius should traverse rue jean jacques rousseau between enjoi tax and cliffe trac
source trac took his arm pay attention
this is the fuel karriere now called rue jean jacques rousseau on account of a singular household which lived in it sixty years ago
this consisted of jean jacques and therese
from time to time little beings were born there
there we gave birth to them jean jacques represented them as found kings
and enjo lead addressed course trac roughly silence in the presence of jean jacques
i admire that man
he denied his own children that may be but he adopted the people
not one of these young men articulated the word the emperor
jean proud wire alone sometimes said napoleon all the others said bonaparte
en no less pronounced it buona parts
marius was vaguely surprised
initium sapient use
chapter iv the backroom of the cafe musa in one of the conversations among the young men at which marius was present and in which he sometimes joined was a veritable shock to his mind
this took place in the backroom of the cafe husain
nearly all the friends of the abc has convened that evening
the art and lamp was solemnly lighted
they talked of one thing and another without passion and with noise
with the exception of enjoi gas and marius who held their peace all were haranguing rather at haphazard
conversations between comrades sometimes are subject to these peaceable tumults
it was a game and an uproar as much as a conversation
they tossed words to eachother and caught them up in turn
they were chattering in all quarters
no woman was admitted to this backroom except louis on the dishwasher of the cafe who passed through it from time to time to go to her washing in the lavatory
grant site thoroughly drunk was deafening the corner of which he had taken possession reasoning and contradicting at the top of his lungs and shouting i am thirsty

this statue was from the hand of the greek sculptor strong y lion who also served that figure of an amazon known as the beautiful legs us memos which nero carried with him in his travels

in the last corner they were talking politics
the charter which had been granted was getting roughly handled
combe degree as upholding it weakly
source trac was energetically making a breach in it
on the table lay an unfortunate copy of the famous touquet charter
source trac had seized it and was brandishing if mingling with his arguments the rattling of this sheet of paper

it was winters couple of favors were crackling in the fireplace
this was tempting and source trac could not resist
he crumpled the poor touquet charter in his fist and flung it in the fire
the paper flashed up

turn philosophically and contented himself with saying the charter metamorphosed into flame

the burst of laughter starts from a tender feeling
at the moment of jest the serious makes it's entry
impulses depend on the first chance word
the spirit of each is sovereign next survives to open the field to the unexpected
these are conversations with abrupt turns in which the perspective changes suddenly
chance is the stage manager of such conversations
a severe thought starting oddly from a clash of words suddenly traversed the conflict of ships in which grants irena hotel proud site bosquet combe ferre and source trac were confusedly fencing
how does a phrase crop up in a dialogue
whence comes it that it suddenly impresses itself on the attention of those who year it
we have just said that no one knows anything about it
in the midst of the uproar bosquet all at once terminated some apostrophe to combe ferre with this date june th waterloo
at this name of waterloo marius who was leaning his elbows on a table beside a glass of water removed his wrist from beneath his chin and began to gaze fixedly at the audience
par dieu
exclaimed court eur asp arg leu was falling into disuse at this period that number is strange and strikes me
it is bonaparte's fatal number

enjoi rss who had remained huge up to that point broke the silence and addressed this remark to combe ferre you mean to say the crime and the expiation
this word crime over passed the measure of what markus who was already greatly agitated by the abrupt evocation of waterloo could accept
he rose walked slowly to the map of france spread out on the wall and an whose base an island was visible in a separate compartment laid his finger on this compartment and said corsica a little island which has rendered france very great
this was like a breath of ict air
all ceased talking
they felt that something was on the point of occurring
bw hotel replying to bosquet was just assuming an attitude of the torso to which he was addicted
he gave it up to listen
enjoi tax whose blue eye was not fixed on anyone and who seemed to be gazing at space replied without glancing at marius france needs no corsica to be great
france is great because she is france
qui a nominal eo
markus felt no desire to retreat he turned towards enjoi gas and his voice burst forth with a vibration which came from a quiver of his very being god forbid that i should diminish france
but amalgamating napoleon with her is not diminishing her

he had everything
he was complete
he had in his brain the sum of human faculties
he made codes like justinian be dictated like caesar his conversation was mingled with the lightning flash of pascal with the thunderclap of tacitus he made history and he wrote it his bulletins are iliad she combines the cipher of newton with the metaphor of mahomet he left behind him in the east words as great as the pyramids attila if he taught emperor's majesty at the academy of science she replied to la place in the council of state beheld his own against merlin he gave a soul to the geometry of the first and to the chicanery of the last news sale fiat with the attorneys and sidereal with the astronomers like cromwell blowing out one of two candles he went to the temple to bargain for a curtain tassel he saw everything he knew everything which did not prevent him from laughing good naturedly beside the cradle of his little child and all at once frightened europe lent a near armies put themselves in motion parks of artillery rumbled pontoons stretched over the rivers clouds of cavalry galloped in the storm cries trumpets a trembling of the ones in every direction the frontiers of kingdoms oscillated on the map the sound of a superhuman sword was heard as it was drawn from its sheath they beheld him him rise erect on the horizon with a blazing brand in his hand and a glow in his eyes unfolding amid the thunder his two wings the grand army and the old guard and he was the archangel of war
all held their peace and em hold a showed his head
silence always produces somewhat the effect of acquiescence of the enemy being driven to the wall
marius continues with increased enthusiasm and almost without pausing for breath let us be just my friends
what a splendid destiny for a nation to be the empire of such an emperor when that nation is france and when it adds its own genius to the genius of that man

to be free said combe ferre
marius lowered his head in his turn that cold and simple word had traversed his epic effusion like a blade of steel and he felt it vanishing within him
when he raised his eyes combe ferre was no longer there
probably satisfied with his reply to the apotheosis he had just taken his departure and all with the exception of enjoi rashad followed him
the room had been emptied
enjoi rss left alone with marika was gazing gravely at him
markus however having rallied his ideas to some extent did not consider himself beaten there lingered in him a trace of inward fermentation which was on the point no doubt of translating itself into syllogisms arrayed against em hold as when all of a sudden they heard someone singing on the stairs as he went
it was combe ferre and this is what he was singing sidecarn'avait donne lag loire et la guerre etqu'il ne falls it quitterl' amour de ma mere jedi raid au grand cesar repre newton sceptre et goncharj'aime mieux makers of us

the wild and tender accents with which combe feeds sang communicated to this couplets sort of strange grandeur
marius thoughtfully and with his eyes filed on the ceiling repeated almost mechanically my mother
at that moment he felt em hold as' hand on his shoulder
citizens aiden hold as to him my mother is the republic
chapter vides an gusta that evening left marius profoundly shaken and with a melancholy shadow in his soul
he felt what the earth may possibly feel at the moment when it is torn open with the iron in order that grain may be deposited within if it feels only the wound the quiver of the germans the joy of the fruit only arrive later
marius was gloomy
he had but just acquired a faith must be then reject it already
he affirmed to himself that he would not
he declares to himself that he would not doubt and he began to doubt in spite of himself
to stand between two religions from one of which you have not as yet emerged and another into which you have not yet entered is intolerable and twilight is pleasing only to bat like souls
marius was clear eyes and be required the true light
the half lights of doubt pained him
whatever may have been his desire to remain where he was he could not halt there he was irresistibly constrained to continue to advance to examine to think to march further
whither would this lead him
he feared after having taken so many steps which had brought him nearer to his father to now take a step which should estrange him from that father
his discomfort was augmented by all the reflections which occurred to him
an escarpment rose around him
he was in accord neither with his grandfather nor with his friends dating in the eyes of the one he was behind the times in the eyes of the others and he recognized the fact that he was doubly isolated on the side of age and on the side of youth
he ceased to go to the cafe husain
in the troubled state of his conscience be no longer thought of certain serious sides of existence
the realities of life do not allow themselves to be forgotten
they soon elbowed him abruptly
one morning the proprietor of the hotel entered marius' room and said to him monsieur court eur as answered for you
yes
but i must have my money
request source trac to come and talk with me said marius
source trac having made his appearance the host left them
marius then told him what it had not before occurred to him to relate that he was the same as alone in the world and had no relatives
what is to become of you
said source trac
i do not know in the least replied marius
what are you going to do
i do not know
have you any money
fifteen france
do you want me to lend you some
never
have you clothes
here is what i have
have you trinkets
a watch
silver
gold here it is
i know a clothes dealer who will take your frock coat and a pair of trousers
that is good
you will then have only a pair of trousers a waistcoat a hat and a coat
and my boots
what
you will not go barefoot
what opulence
that will be enough
i know a watchmaker who will buy your watch
that is good
go it is not good
what will you do after that
whatever is necessary
anything honest that is to say
do you know english
no
do you know german
no
so much the worse
why
because one of my friends a publisher is getting up a sort of an encyclopaedia for which you might have translated english or german articles
it is badly paid work but one can live by it
i will learn english and german
and in the meanwhile
in the meanwhile i will live on my clothes and my watch
the clothes dealer was sent for
he paid twenty francs for the cast off garments
they went to the watchmaker's
he bought the watch for forty five france
that is not had said marius to source trac on their return to the hotel with my fifteen francs that makes eighty
and the hotel bill
observed four tetras
hello i had forgotten that said markus
the landlord presented his bill which had to be paid on the spot
it amounted to seventy france
i have ten france left said markus
the deuce exclaimed source trac you will eat up five france while you are learning english and five while learning german
that will be swallowing a tongue very fast or a hundred so is very slowly
in the meantime sun triple norm and a rather good hearted person at bottom in difficulties had finally hunter up marius' above
one morning on his return from the law school marius found a letter from his aunt and the sixty list olds that is today six hundred francs in gold in a sealed box
marius sent back the thirty louis to his aunt with a respectful letter in which he stated that he had sufficient means of subsistence and that he should be able thenceforth to supply all his needs
at that moment he had three france left
his aunt did not inform his grandfather of this refusal for fear of exasperating him
besides had he not said let me never hear the name of that blood drinker again
marius left the hotel de la porte saint jacques as he did not wish to run in debt there
book fifth
the excellence of misfortune chapter i marius indigent illustration excellence of misfortune b misfortune life became hard for marius
it was nothing to eat his clothes and his watch
he ate of that terrible inexpressible thing that is called de la vache engage that is to say he endured great hardships and privations
a terrible thing it is containing days without bread nights without sleep evenings without a candle an earth without a fire weeks without works future without hope a coat out at the elbows an old hat which evokes the laughter of young girls a door which one finds locked on one at night because one's rent is not paid the insolence of the porter and the cookshop man the sheets of neighbors humiliations dignity trampled on work of whatever nature accepted disgusts bitterness despondency
markus learned how all this is eaten and how such are often the only things which one has to devour
at that moment of his existence when a man needs his pride because he needs love he felt that he was jeered at because he was badly dressed and ridiculous because he was poor
at the age when you the wells the heart with imperial pride he dropped his eyes more than once on his dilapidated boots and he knew the unjust shame and the poignant blushes of wretchedness
admirable and terrible trial from which the feeble emerge base from which the strong emerge sublime
a crucible into which destiny casts a man whenever it desires a scoundrel or a demigod
for many great deeds are performed in petty combats
there are instances of bravery ignored and obstinate which defend themselves step by step in that fatal onslaught of necessities and turpitude s
noble and mysterious triumphed rich body she holds which are required with no renown which are saluted with no trumpet flash
life misfortune isolation abandonment poverty are the fields of battle which have their heroes obscure heroes who are sometimes grander than the heroes who won renown
firm and rare natures are thus created misery almost always a stepmother is sometimes another destitution gives birth to night of soul and spirit distress is the nurse of pride in happiness is a good milk for the magnanimous
there came a moment in marius' life when he swept his own landing when he bought his sou's worth of brie cheese at the fruit fred's when he waited until twilight had fallen to slip into the baker's and purchase a loaf which he carried off furtively to his attic as though he had stolen it
sometimes there could be seen holding into the butcher's shop on the corner in the midst of the bantering cooks who elbowed him an awkward young man carrying big books under his arm who had a timid get angry air who in entering removed his hat from abroad here on stood drops of perspiration made a profound how to the butcher's astonished wife asked for a mutton cutlet paid six or seven sous for it wrapped it up in a paper put it under his arm between two books and went away
it was marius
on this cutlet which he cooked for himself he lived for three days
on the first day he ate the meat on the second heard the day of the third he gnawed the bone
aunt gillen or hand made repeated attempts and sent him the sixty pistol es several times
marius returned them on every occasion saying that he needed nothing
he was still in mourning for his father when the revolution which we have just described was effected within him
from that time forth he had not out of this black garments
but his garments were quitting him
the day came when he had no longer a coat
the trousers would go next
what was to be done
source trac to whom he had on his side done some good turns gave him an old coat
for thirty sous marius got it turned by some porter or other and it was a new coat
buy this cost was green
then marius ceased to go out until after nightfall
this made his coat black
as he did he'd always to appear in mourning be clothed himself with the night
in spite of all this he got admitted to practice as a lawyer
he was supposed to live in source urac's room which was decent and where a certain number of law books backed up and completed by several dilapidated volumes of romance passed as the library required by the regulations
he had his letters addressed to source urac's quarters
when marius became a lawyer he informed his grandfather of the fact in a letter which was cold but full of submission and respect
m
ville norm and trembled as he took the letter read it tore it in four pieces and threw it into the wastebasket
two or three days later mademoiselle ville norm and heard her father who was alone in his room talking aloud to himself
he always did this whenever he was greatly agitated
she listened and the old man was saying if you were not a fool you would know that one can not be a baron and a lawyer at the same time
chapter ii marius poor it is the same with wretchedness as with everything else
items any becoming bearable
it finally assumes a form and adjusts itself
one vegetated that is to say one develops in a certain meagre fashion which is however sufficient for life
this is the mode in which the existence of marius pont mercy was arranged he had passed the worst straits the narrow pass was opening out a little in front of him
by dint of toil perseverance courage and will he had managed to draw from his work about seven hundred francs a year
he had learned german and english thanks to source trac who had put him in communication with his friend the publisher marius filled the modest post of utility man in the literature of the publishing house
he drew up prospectuses translated newspapers annotated editions compiled biographies etc.
net product year in and tear out seven hundred francs
he lived on it
how
not so badly
we will explain
marine occupied in the gorge au house for an annual sum of thirty france aden minus a fireplace called a cabinet which contained only the most indispensable articles of furniture
this furniture belonged to him
he gave three francs a month to the old principal tenant to come and sweep his hole and to bring him a little hot water every morning a fresh egg and a penny roll
he breakfasted on this egg and roll
his breakfast varied in cost from two to four sous according as eggs were dead or cheap
at sixo'clock in the evening he descended the rue saint jacques to dine at rousseau's opposite basset's the stamp dealer's on the corner of the rue des math urine
he ate no soup
he took a six so i platform data half portion of vegetables for three cpus and a three sou dessert
for three sous he got as much bread as he wished
as for wine he drank water
when he paid at the desk where had an rousseau at that period still plump and rosy majestically presided he gave as ok to the waiter and madam rousseau gave him a smile
then he went away
for sixteen sous he had a smile and a dinner
this restaurant rousseau where so few bottles and so many water carafes were emptied was a calming potion rather than a restaurant
it no longer exists
the proprietor had a fine nickname he was called rousseau the aquatic
thus breakfast four sous dinner sixteen sous his food cost him twenty sousa day which made three hundred and sixty five france a year
add the thirty francs for rent and the thirty six france to the old woman plus a few trifling expenses for four hundred and fifty france marius wasted lodged and waited on
his clothing cost him a hundred francs his linen vichy france his washing fifty francs the whole did not exceed six hundred and fifty france
he was rich
be some time spent ten brands to a friend
source trac had once been able to borrow sixty francs of him
as far as fire was concerned as marius had no fireplace he has simplified matters
marius always had two complete suite of clothes the one old for everyday the other brand new for special occasions
both were black
he had but three shirts one on his person the second in the commode and the third in the washer woman's hands
he renewed them as they wore out
they were always ranges which caused him to button his coat to the chin
it had required years for marius to attain to this flourishing condition
hard years difficult some of them to traverse others to climb
marius had not failed for a single day
he had endured every djing in the way of destitution he had done everything except contract debts
he did himself the justice to say that he had never owed anyone as ok
a debt was to him the beginning of slavery
he even said to himself that a creditor is worse by ara master for the master possesses only your persona credit or possesses your dignity and can administer to its box on the ear
rather than borrow he went without food
he had passed many a day fasting
feeling that all extremes meet and that if one is not on one's guard powered fortunes may lead to baseness of soul he kept a jealous watch on his pride
such and such a formality of action which in any other situation would have appeared merely a reference to him now seemed in solidity and he needed himself against it
his face words sort of severe flush
he was timid even to rudeness
during all these trials he had felt himself encouraged and even uplifted at times by a secret force that he possessed within himself
the soul aids the body and at certain moments raises it
it is the only bird which bears up its own care
besides his father's name another name was graven in marius' heart the name of the barrier
marius with his grave and enthusiastic nature surrounded with a sort of aureole the man to whom in his thought she owed his father's life that intrepid sergeant who had saved the colonel amid the bullets and the cannon balls of waterloo
he never separated the memory of this man from the memory of his father and he associated them in his generation
it was a sort of worship in two steps with the grand alter for the colonel and the obese done for the barrier
what redoubled the tenderness of his gratitude towards the barrier was the idea of the distress into which he knew that the barrier had fallen and which has engulfed the latter
marius had learned at montrer neil of the ruin and bankruptcy of the unfortunate innkeeper
since that time he had made unheard of efforts to find traces of him and to reach him in that dark abyss of misery in which the barrier had disappeared
marius had beaten the whole country he had gone to chelles to bondy to tourney to nogent to lanny
he had led sister for three years exp ending in these explorations the little money which he had laid by
no one had been able to give him any news of the hardie she was supposed to have gone abroad
his creditors had also sought him with less love than markus but with as much assiduity and had not been able to lay their hands on him
marius blames himself and was almost angry with himself for his lack of success in his researches
it was the only debt left him by the colonel and marius made it a matter of honor to pay it
what he thought when my father lay dying on the field of battle did the hardier contrive to find him amid the smoke and the grapes hot and hear him off on his shoulders and yet he owed him nothing and i who owe so much to the hardier can not join him in this shadow where he is lying in the pangs of death and in my turn bring him back from death to life
oh
i will find him
to find the barrier in fact marius would have given one of his arms to rescue him from his misery he would have sacrificed all his blood
to see the barrier to render the barrier some service to say to him you do not know me well i do know you
here i am
dispose of me
this was marius' sweetest and most magnificent dream
chapter iii marius grown up at this epoch marius was twenty years of age
it was three years since he has left his grandfather
both parties had remained on the same terms without attempting to approach each other and without seeking to see each other
besides what was the use of seeing each other
marius was the brass base while father filme norm and was the iron pot
we admit that marius was mistaken as to his grandfather's heart
he had imagined that m
ville norm and had never loved him and that that crusty harsh and smiling old fellow who cursed shouted and stormed and brandished his cane cherished for him at the most only that affection which is at once slight and severe of the dot area of comedy
marius was in error
there are fathers who do not love their children there exists no grandfather who does not adore his grandson
at bottom as we have said m
ville norm and idolized marius
he idolized him after his own fashion with an accompaniment of snap post news and boxes on the ear but this child once gone he felt a black void in his heart he would allow no one to mention the child to him and all the while secretly regretted that he was so well obeyed
at first he hoped that this bulb ap artist this jacob in this terrorist this septem b dist would return
but the weeks passed by years passed tom
guild norm and's great despair the blood drinker did not make his appearance
i could not do otherwise than turn him out said the grandfather to himself and he asked himself if the thing were to do over again would i do it
his pride instantly answered yes but his aged head which he shook in silence replied sadly no
he had his hours of depression
he missed marius
old men need affection as they need the sun
it is warmth
strong as his nature was the absence of marius had wrought some change in him
nothing in the world could have induced him to take a step towards that rogue but he suffered
he never inquired about him but he thought of him incessantly
he lived in the marais in a more and more retired manner he was still merry and violent as of old but his merriment use a convulsive harshness and his violence's always terminated in a sort of gentle and gloomy rejection
he sometimes said on
if he only would return what a good box on the war i would give him
as for his aunt she thought too little to love much marius was no longer for her much more than a vague black form and she eventually came to occupy herself with him much less than with the cat or the park surf which she probably had
what augmented father ville norm and's secret suffering was that he locked it all up within his breast and did not allow its existence to be divined
his sorrow was like those recently invented furnaces which consume their own smoke
it sometimes happened that officious busybodies spoke to him of marius and asked him what is your grandson doing
what has become of him
the old bourgeois replied with a sigh that he was a sad case and giving a fillip to his cuff if he wished to appear gay monsieur le baron de pont mercy is practising petri dogging in some corner or other
while the old man regretted marine applauded himself
as is the case with all good hearted people misfortune had eradicated his bitterness
he only thought of m
ville normandin an amiable light but he had set his mind on not receiving anything more from the man who had been unkind to his father
this was the mitigated translation of his first indignation
moreover he was happy at having suffered and at suffering still
it was for his father's sake
the hardness of his life satisfied and pleased him
he said to himself with a sort of joy that it was certainly the least he could do that it was an expiation that has it not been for that he would have been punished in some other way and later on for his impious indifference towards his father and such a father
that it would not have been just that his father should have all the suffering and he none of it and that in any case what were his tools and his destitution compared with the colonel's heroic life
that in short the only way for him to approach his father and resemble him was to be brave in the face of indigence as the other had been valiant before the enemy and that that was no doubt what the colonel has meant to imply by the words he will be worthy of it
words which marius continued to wear not on his breast since the colonel's writing had disappeared but in his heart
and then on the way when his grandfather had turned him out of doors he had been only a child now he was a man
he felt it
misery we repeat had been good for him
poverty in youth when it succeeds has this magnificent property about it that it turns the whole will towards effort and the whole soul towards aspiration
poverty instantly lays material life bare and renders it hideous hence inexpressible rounds towards the ideal life
the wealthy young man has a hundred coarse and brilliant distractions horse races hunting dogs tobacco gaming good repast send all the rest of it occupations for the baser side of the soul at the expense of the loftier and more delicate sides
the poor young man wins his bread with difficulty he eats when he has eaten he has nothing more but meditation
he goes to the spectacles which god furnished gratis he gazed at the sky space the stars flowers children the humanity among which he is suffering the creation amid which he beams
he gazed so much on humanity that he perceives it's soul he gazed upon creation to such an extent that he beholds god
he dreams he feels himself great be dreams on and feels himself tender
from the egotism of the man who suffer she passes to the compassion of the man who meditates
an admirable sentiment breaks for thing i'm forgetfulness of self and pity for all
as he thinks of the innumerable enjoyments which nature offer st ives and lavished to souls which stand open and refuses to souls that are closed he comes to pity me the million naire of the mind the million naire of money
all hatred departs from his heart in proportion a slight penetrates his spirit
and is he unhappy
no
the misery of a young man is never miserable
the first young lad who comes to hand however poor he may be with his strength his health his rapid walk his brilliant eyes his warmly circulating blood his black hair his red lips his white teeth his pure breath will always arouse the envy of an aged emperor
and then every morning he sets himself a fresh to the task of earning his bread and while his hands earn his bread his dorsal column gains price his brain gathers ideas
his task finished he returns to ineffable ecstasies to contemplation to joy she beholde his feet set in afflictions in obstacles on the pavement in the nettles sometimes in the mire his head in the light
he is firm serene gentle peaceful attentive serious content with little kindly and he thanks god for having bestowed on him those two forms of riches which many a rich man lacks work which makes him free and thought which makes him dignified
this is what had happened with marius
to tell the truth be in cloned a little too much to the side of contemplation
from the day when he had succeeded in earning his living with some approach to certainty he had stopped thinking it good to be poor and re trenching time from his work to give to thought that is to say he sometimes passed entire days in meditation absorbed engulfed like a visionary in the mute voluptuousness of ecstasy and inward radiance
he had thus propounded the problem of his love to toil as little as possible at material labor in order to toil as much as possible at the labor which is impalpable in other words to bestow a few hours on real life and to cast the rest to the infinite
as he believed that he lacked nothing he did not perceive that contemplation this understood ends by becoming one of the forms of idleness that he was content ing himself with conquering the first necessities of life and that he was resting from his labors too soon
it was evident that for this energetic and enthusiastic nature this could only be a transitory state and that at the first shock against the inevitable complications of destiny marius would awaken
in the meantime although he was a lawyer and whatever father gillen or hand thought about the matter he was not practising he was not even petri fogging
meditation had turned him aside from pleading
to haunt attorneys to follow the court to hunt up cased what a bore
why should be doit
he saw no reason for changing the manner of gaining his livelihood
the obscure and i'll paid publishing establishment had come to mean for him azure source of work which did not involve too much labor as we have explained and which survived for his wants
one of the publishers for whom he worked m
na ginei i think offered to take him unto his own house to lodge him well to furnish him with regular occupation and to give him fifteen hundred francs a year
to be well lodged
fifteen hundred francs
no doubt
but renounce his liberty
be on fixed wages
a sort of hired man of letters
according to marius' opinion if he accepted his position would become both better and worse at the same time he acquired comfort and lost his dignity it was a fine and complete unhappiness converted into a repulsive and ridiculous state of torture something like the case of a blind man who should recover the sight of one eye
he refused
marius dwelt in solitude
owing to his taste for remaining outside of everything and through having been too much alarmed he had not entered decidedly into the group presided over by enjoi rss
they had remained good friends they were ready to assist each other in occasion in every possible way but nothing more
marius had two friends one young source trac and one old m
have kb
he inclined more to the old man
in the first place he owed to him the revolution which had taken place within him to him he was indebted for having known and loved his father
he operated on me for a cataract he said
the church warren had certainly played a decisive part
it was not however that m
have it had been anything but the calm and impassive agent of providence in this connection
he had enlightened markus by chance and without being aware of the fact as does a candle which some one brings he had been the candle and not the someone
as for marine' inward political revolution m
have it was totally incapable of comprehending it or willing or of directing it
as we shall seek
have it again later on a few words will not be superfluous
chapter iv m
have it on the day when m
mabe he said to marius certainly i approve of political opinions he expressed the real state of his mind
all political opinions were matters of indifference to him and he approved them all without distinction provided they left him in peace as the greeks called the furies the beautiful the good the charming the eumenides
m
have ub's political opinion consisted in a passionate love for plants and above all for books
like all the rest of the world he possessed the termination inist without which no one could exist at that time but he was neither a royalist a bona p artists chart is tabor is a gift not an anarchist he was an ou qui just a collector of old books
he did not understand how men could busy themselves with hating each other because of silly stuff like the charter democracy legitimacy monarchy the republic etc.
when there were in the world all sorts of mosses grasses and shrubs which they might be looking at and heaps of folios and even if mos which they might turnover
he took goods are not to become useless having books did not prevent his reading being a botanist did not prevent his being a gardener
when he made pont mercy's acquaintance this sympathy had existed between the colonel and himself that what the colonel did for flowers he did for fruits
m
have it had succeeded in producing seedling pests as savory as the pears of st
germain it is from one of his combinations apparently that the october mirabelle now celebrated and no less perfumed than the summer mirabelle owes its origin
he went to mass rather from gentleness than from piety and because as he loved the faces of men but hated their noise he found them assembled and silent only in church
feeling that he must be something in the state he had chosen the career of warden
however he had never succeeded in loving any woman as much as a tulip bulb nor any man as much as an size for
he had long passes sixty when one day someone asked him have you never been married
i have forgotten said he
when it sometimes happened to him and to whom does it not happen
today on
if i were only rich
it was not when ogling a pretty girl as was the case with father ville normand but when contemplating an old book
he lived alone with an old housekeeper
he was somewhat youth and when he was asleep his aged fingers stiffened with rheumatism lay crooked join the folds of his sheets
he had composed and published a flora of the environs of caut eretz with colored played a work which enjoyed a tolerable measure of esteem and which sold well
people ran this belkin the themes is rss two or three times a day to ask for it
he sees as much as two thousand francs a year from it this constitutes nearly the whole of his fortune
although poor he had had the talent to form for himself by dint of patience privat jobs and times previous collection of rare copies of every sort
he never went out without a book under his arm and he often returned with two
the sole decor ation of the four rooms on the ground floor which composed his lodgings consisted of framed herbarium's and engravings of the old masters
the sight of a sword of a gun chilled his blood
he had never approached a cannon in his life even at the invalides
he had a passable stomach a brother who was a cure perfectly white hair no teeth either in his mouth of his mind a trembling in every limb a picard accent an infantile laugh the air of an old sheep and he was easily frightened
add to this that he had no other friendship no other acquaintance among the living than an old bookseller of the ports saint jacques named royal
his dream was to naturalize indigo in france
his servant was also a sort of innocent
the poor good old woman was a spinster
sultan her car which might have me wed allegro's miserere in the sistine chapel had filled her heart and sufficed for the quantity of passion which existed in her
none of her dreams had ever proceeded as far as man
she had never been able to get further than her cat
like him she had a mustache
her glory consisted in her caps which were always white
she passed her time on sundays after mass in counting over the linen in her chest and in spreading out on her bed the dresses in the piece which she bought and never had made up
she knew how to read
n
have it had nicknamed her mother plug atque
m
have it had taken a fancy to marius because marius being young and gentle warned his age without startling his timidity
youth combined with gentleness produced on old people the effect of the sun with our wind
when marius was saturated with military glory with gunpowder with marches and counter marches and with all those prodigious battles in which his father had given and received such tremendous blows of the sword he went to seek
mansur and m
mabe he talked to him of his hero from the point of view of flowers
his brother the cure died about and almost immediately as when the night is drawing on the whole horizon grew dark form
man eur
a notary's failure deprived him of the sum of ten thousand francs which was all that he possessed in his brother's right and his own
the revolution of july brought a crisis to publishing
in a period of embarrassment the first thing which does not sell usa flora
the doors of the environs of caut eretz stopped short
weeks passed by without a single purchaser
sometimes m
have it started at the sound of the bell
monsieur said mother pour se que sadly it is the water carrier
in short one day m
man eur quitted the theme sierra abdicated the functions of warden gave up saint sulpice sold not a part of his books but on his prints that to which he was the least attached and installed himself in a little house on the rue montparnasse where however he remained but one quarter for two reasons in the first place the ground floor and the garden cost three hundred francs and he dared not spend more than two hundred francs on his rent in the second being near eaton's shooting gallery he could hear the pistol shoes which was intolerable to him
he carried of this flora his copper plates his herbarium stis portfolios and his books and established himself near the wallet for reina sort of thatched cottage of the village of austerlitz where for fifty crowns a year he got three rooms and a garden enclosed by a hedge and containing a well
he took advantage of this removal to sell off nearly all his furniture
on the day of his entrance into his new quarters he was very gay and drove the nails on which his engravings and herbarium's were to hang with his own hands during is garden the rest of the day and at night perceiving that mother plug atque had a melancholy air and was very thoughtful he tapped her on the shoulder and said to her with a smile we have the indigo
only two visitors the bookseller of the ports saint jacques and marius we read nl free to view the thatched cottage at austerlitz a brawling name which was to tell the truth extremely disagreeable to him
however as we have just pointed out brains which are absorbed in some bit of wisdom of folly or as it often happens in both at once are but slowly accessible to the things of actual life
their own destiny is a far off thing to them
there results from such concentrations passivity which if it were the outcome of reasoning would resemble philosophy
one declines descends trickles away even crumbles away and yet is hardly conscious of it one's self
it always ends it is true in an awakening but the awakening is tardy
in the meantime it seems as though we held ourselves neutral in the game which is going on between our happiness and our unhappiness
we are the stake and we look on at the game with indifference
it is thus that athwart the cloud which formed about him when all his hopes were extinguished one after the other m.
have it remained rather puerile it but profoundly serene
his habits of mind had the regular swing of a pendulum
once mounted on an illusion he went for a very long time even after the illusion had disappeared
a clock does not stop short at the precise moment when the key is lost
m
jan such as his innocent pleasures
these pleasures were inexpensive and unexpected the merest chance furnished them
one day mother plug atque was reading a romance in one corner of the room
she was reading aloud finding that she understood better thus
to read aloud is to assure one's self of what one is reading
there are people who read very loud and who have the appearance of giving themselves their word of honor as to what they are perusing
it was with this sort of energy that mother plug atque was reading the romance which she had in hand
m
have yet gardner without listening to her
in the course of her reading mother plug arques and to this phrase
it was a question of an officer of dragoons and a beauty the beauty poured and the dragoon here she interrupted herself to wipe her glasses
blue dha and the dragon struck in m
have it in a low voice
yes it is true that there was a dragon which from the depths of its save spouted flame through his mae and set the heavens on fire
many stars had already been consumed by this monster which besides had the class of a tiger
four dts went into its demand succeeded in converting the dragon
that is a good book that you are reading mother plug atque
there is no more beautiful legend in existence
and m
have us fell into a delicious revert
chapter v poverty a good neighbor for misery marius liked this candid old man who saw himself gradually falling into the clutches of indigence and who came to feel astonishment little by little without however being made melancholy by it
marius key source grab and sought out m
man eur
very rarely however twice a month at most
marius' pleasure consisted in taking long walks alone on the outer boulevards or in the champ are made or in the least frequented alleys of the luxembourg
he often spent half a day in gazing at a market garden the feds of lettuce the chickens on the dung heap the horse turning the water wheel
the passers by stared at him in surprise and some of them though this attire suspicious and his mien sinister
he was only a poor young man dreaming in an object less way
it was during one of his strolls that he had hit upon the gorge au house and tempted by its isolation and its cheapness had taken up his abode there
he was known there only under the name of m
marius
some of his father's old generals of old comrades had invited him to go and see them when they learned about him
marius had not refused their invitations
they afforded opportunities of talking about his father
thus he went from time to time to do it epa molto general bell avec nero general fri tion to the invalides
there was music and dancing there
on such evenings marius put on his jd a coat
but he never went to these evening parties or balls except on days when it was freezing cold because he could not afford a carriage and he did not wish to arrive with boots otherwise than like mirrors
he said sometimes but without bitterness men are so have that in a drawing room you may be soiled everywhere except on your shoes
in order to insure a good reception there only one irreproachable thing is asked if you your conscience
to your boots
all passions except those of the heart are dissipated by're very
marius' political fevers vanished this
the revolution of assisted in the process by satisfying and calming him
he remained the same setting aside his fits of wrath
he still held the same opinions
only they had been tempered
to speak accurately he had no longer any opinions he had sympathies
to what part i did he belong
to the party of humanity
out of humanity he chose france out of the nation he chose the people out of the people he chose the woman
it was to that point above all that his pity was directed
now he preferred an idea to a deed a poet to a hero and he admired a book like job more than an event like marengo
and then when after a day spent in meditation he returned in the evening through the boulevards and caught a glimpse through the branches of the trees of the fathomless space beyond the nameless gleams the abyss the shadow the mystery all that which is only human seemed very petty indeed to him
he thought that he had and he really had in fact arrived at the truth of life and of human philosophy and he had ended by gazing at nothing but heaven the only thing which truth can perceive from the bottom of her well
this did not prevent him from multiplying his plans his combinations his scaffolding show projects for the future
in this state of're very an eye which could have cast a glance into marius' interior would have been dazzled with the purity of that soul
in fact had it been given to our eyes of the flesh to gaze into the consciences of others we should be able to judge a man much more surely according to what he dreams than according to what he thinks
there is willin thought there is none in dreams
're very which is utterly spontaneous takes and keeps even in the gigantic and the ideal the form of our spirit
nothing proceeds more directly and more sincerely from the very depth of our soul than our un premeditated and boundless aspirations towards the splendors of destiny
in these aspirations much more than in deliberate rational coordinated ideas is the real character of a man to be found
our chimeras are the things which the most resemble us
each one of us dreams of the unknown and the impossible in accordance with his nature
towards the middle of this year the old woman who waited on marius told him that his neighbor's the wretched jon dee the family had been turned out of doors
marius who passed nearly the whole of his days out of the house hardly knew that he had any neighbors
why are they turned out
he asked
because they do not pay their rent they owe for two quarters
how much is it
twenty france said the old woman
marius had thirty france saved up in a drawer
her she said to the old woman make these twenty five france
pay for the poor people and give them five france and do not tell them that it was i
chapter vi the substitute it chanced that the regiment to which lieutenant theory of belonged came to perform garrison within paris
this inspired sun grille normand with a second idea
she had on the first occasion hit upon the plan of having marius spied upon by the ovule now and plotted to have the ovule take marius' place
at all events and in case the grandfather should feel the vagueness of a young face in the house these days of dawn are sometimes sweet to ruin it was expedient to find another marius
take it as a simple erratum she thought such as one sees in books
for markus read the ovule
age and nephew is almost the same as a grandson in default of a lawyer one takes a lander
one morning when m
bills norm and was about to read something in the quotidienne his daughter entered and said to him in her sweetest voice for the question concerned her favorite father theo rule is coming to present his respects to you this morning
who's the ovule
your grand nephew
ah
said the grandfather
then he went back to his reading thought no more of his grand nephew who was merely some theo rule or other and soon flew into a rare which almost always happened when he read
the sheet which he held although royalist of course announced for the following day without any softening phrases one of these little events which were of daily occurrence at that date in paris that the students of the schools of law and medicine were to assemble on the place du pantheon at midday to deliberate
the discussion concerned one of the questions of the moment the artillery of the national guard and a conflict between the minister of war and the citizen's militia on the subject of the cannon parked in the courtyard of the louvre
the students were to deliberate over this
it did not take much more than this to dwell m
ville norm and's rage
he thought of matins who was a student and who would probably go with the rest to deliberate at midday on the place du pantheon
as he was indulging in this painful dream lieutenant the ovule entered clad in plain clothes as a bourgeois which was clever of him and was discreetly introduced by mademoiselle ville normand
the lancer had reasoned as follows the old druid has not sunk all his money in a life pension
it is well to disguise one's self as a civilian from time to time
mademoiselle ville norm and said aloud to her father the ovule your grand nephew
and in a low voice to the lieutenant approve of everything
and she withdrew
the lieutenant who was but little accustomed to such venerable encounters stammered with some timidity good day uncle and made a salute composed of the involuntary and mechanical outline of the military salute finished off as a bourgeois salute
ah
so it's you that is well sit down said the old gentleman
that said he totally forgot the lancer
the ovule seated himself and m
ville norman d. rose
j
ville norm and began to pace back and forth his hands in his pockets talking aloud and twitching with his irritated old fingers at the two watches which he wore in his two dogs
that lack of brats
they convene on the place du pantheon
by my life
urchins who were with their nurses but yesterday
if one were to squeeze their noses milk would burst out
and they deliberate tomorrow at midday
what are we coming to
what are we coming to
it is clear that we are making for the abyss
that is what the sexcam is a dos have brought us to
to deliberate on the citizen artillery
to go and jabber in the open air over the mines of the national guard
and with whom are they to meet there
just sees higher jacobin i am leads
i will get anything you like a million against a counter that there will be no one there but returned convicts and released galley slaves
the republicans and the galley slaves they form but one nose and one handkerchief
car not used to say' where would you have md got editor
' touche replied' wherever you please imbecile
' that's what there publis and are like
that is true said the ovule
m
bolle norm and half turned his head swathe of ups and went on when one reflects that that scoundrel was so vile as to turn carbonado
why did you leave my house
to go and become a republican
pssst
in the first place the people want none of your republic they have common sense they know well that there always have been kings and that there always will be they know well that the people are only the people after all they make spot to fit of your republic do you understand idiot
is it not a horrible caprice
to fall in love with pete duchesne to make sheep's eyes at the guillotine to sing romances and play on the guitar under the balcony of' it's enough to make one spot on all these young fellows such tools are they
they are all alike
not one escapes
it suffices for them to breathe the air which blows through the street to lose their senses
the nineteenth century is poison
the first scamp that happens a long lets his beard grow like a goat's thinks himself a real scoundrel and abandons his old relatives
he's a republican he's a romantic
what does that mean romantic
come the favor to tell me what it is
all possible fillies
a year ago they ran to hermano
now i just ask you hermano
anti theses
abominations which are not even written in french
and then they have cannons in the courtyard of the louvre
such are the rascal ities of this age
you are right uncle said the ovule
m
bolle norm and resumed cannons in the courtyard of the museum
for what purpose
do you want to fire grape shot at the apollo belvedere
what have those cartridges to do with the venus de medici
oh
the young men of the present day are all black guards
what a pretty creature is their benjamin constant
and those who are not rascals are simpletons
they do all they can to make them selves ugly they are badly dressed they are afraid of women in the presence of petticoats they have a mendicant air which sets the girls into fits of laughter on my word of honor one would say the poor creatures were ashamed of love
they are deformed and they complete themselves by being stupid they repeat the pins of fierce lin and potier they have sack costs stable men's waistcoats shirts of coarse linen trousers of coarse cloth boots of coarse leather and their rigmarole resembles their plumage
one might make use of their jargon to put news oleson their old shoes
and all this awkward batch of bears has political opinions if you please
political opinions should be strictly forbidden
they fabricate systems they recast society they demolish the monarchy they doing all laws to the earth they put the attic in the cellar's place and my porter in the place of the king they turn europe topsy turvy they reconstruct the world and all their lives traits consist in staring silly at the ankles of the la undresses as these women climb into their carts
ah
marius
ah
you blackguard
to go and co cover are on the public place
to discuss to debate to take measures
they call that measures just god
disorder humbles itself and becomes silly
i have seen chaos know see a mess
students deliberating on the national guard such a thing could not be seen among the ovine was not the car or aches
savages who go naked with their middle's dressed like a shuttle cock with a club in their paws are less of brutes than those bachelors of arts
the four penny monkeys
and they set up for judges
those creatures deliberate and ratio donate
the end of the world is some
this is plainly the end of this miserable here aqueous globe
a final his cough was required and france has emitted it
deliberate my rascals
such things will happen so long as they go and read the newspapers under the arcades of the odeon
that costs them as ok and their good sense and their intelligence and their heart and their soul and their wits
they emerge thence and we call from their families
all newspapers are pests all even the drapeau blanc
at bottom mar rainville was a jacobin
qh
just heaven
you may boast of having driven your grandfather to despair that you may
that is evident said the ovule
and profit ugg by the fact that m
ville norm and was taking breath the lancer added in a magisterial manner there should be no other newspaper than the moniteur and no other book than the annuaire militaire
m
ville norm and continued it is like theirs is yes
are giclee ending in a senator for that is the way they always end
they give themselves as far with the address of thou as citizens in order to get themselves called eventually monsieur le comte
monsieur le comte as big as my arm assassins of september
the philosophers if yes
i will do myself the justice to say that i have never had any better opinion of the philosophies of all those philosophers than of the spectacles of the grimaced of tivoli
one day i saw the senator across the dual map plaque tin man dies of violet velvet down with bees with marsala henri iv
they were hideous
one would have pronounced them monkeys from the tiger's court
citizens i declare to you that your progress is madness that your humanity is a dream that your revolution is a crime that your republic is a monster that your young and virgin france comes from the brothel and i maintain it against all whoever you may be whether journalists economists leg uses or even were you better judges of liberty of equality and fraternity than the knife of the gun oil time
and that i announce to you my fine fellows
par bleu
cried the lieutenant that is wonderfully true
m
gillen of hand paused in a gesture which he had begun wheeled round stated lancer the odile intently in the eyes and said to him you are a fool
book sixth
the conjunction of two stars chapterl' the sobriquet mode of formation of family names marius was at this epoch a handsome young man of medium stature with thick and intensely black hair a lofty and intelligent grow well opened and passionate nostrils an air of calmness and sincerity and with something indescribably proud thoughtful and innocent over his whole countenance
his profile all of whose lines were founded without thereby losing their firmness had a certain germanic sweetness which has made its way into the french physiognomy by way of alsace and lorraine and that complete absence of angles which rendered the six andres so easily recognizable among the romans and which distinguishes the leon one from the aquiline race
he was at that period of life when the kind of men who think is composed in nearly equal parts of depth and ingenious news
a grave situation being given he had all that is required to be stupid one more turn of the key and he might be sublime
his manners we were served cold polished not very genial
as his mouth was charming his lips the reddest and his teeth the whitest in the world his smile corrected the severity of his face as a whole
at certain moments that pure brow and that voluptuous smile presented a singular contrast
his eyes were small but his glance was large
at the period of his most abject misery he had observed that young girls turned round when he passed by and heroes of god with death in his soul
he thought that they were staring at him because of his old clothes and that they were laughing at them the fact is that they stared at him because of his grace and that they dreamed of him
this'm item is under standing between him and the pretty passersby had made him why
he chosen one of them for the excellent reason that he fled from all of them
he loved this indefinitely stupidly a scourge trac said
spurge trac also said to him do not aspire to be venerable they called each other thou it is the tendency of youthful friendships to slip into this mode of address
let me give you a piece of advice my dear fellow
don't read so many books and look a little more at the lass es
the jades have some good points about the mo marius
by dint of fleeing and blushing you will become brutalized
on other occasions source trac encountered him and said good morning monsieurl' abbe
when source trac had addressed to him some remark of this nature marius avoided women both young and old more than ever for a week to come and he avoided source tract i boot
nevertheless there existed in all the immensity of creation two women whom marius did not flee and to whom he paid no attention whatever
in truth he would have been very much amazed if he had been informed that they were women
one was the bearded old woman who swept out his chamber and caused court eur av to say seeing that his servant woman wears his beard marius does not wear his own beard
the other was a sort of little girl whom he saw very often and whom he never looked at
for more than a year marius had noticed in one of the walls of the luxembourg the one which skirts the parapet of the pepin ieee a man and a very young girl who were almost always seated side by side on the same bench at the most solitary end of the alley on the rue del' ouest side
every time that that chance which meddled with the strolls of persons whose gaze is turned inward sled marius to that walk and it was nearly every day he found this couple there
the man appeared to be about sixty years of age he seemed sad and serious his whole person presented the robust and weary aspect peculiar to military men who have retired from the service
if he had worn a decoration marius would have said he is an ex officer
he had a kindly but unapproachable air and he never let his glance linger on the eyes of any one
he wore blue trousers a blue frock coat and abroad brimmed hat which always appeared to be news black cravat a quaker shirt that is to say it was dazzlingly white bit of coarse linen
at rosette who passed near him one day said here's a very tidy widower
his hair was very white
the first time that the young girl who accompanied him came and seated herself on the bench which they seemed to have adopted she was a sort of child thirteen or fourteen years of age so thin as to be almost homely awkward insignificant and with a possible promise of handsome eyes
only they were always raised with a sort of x is pleasing assurance
her dress was not magee and childish like there was of the scholars in a convent it consisted of a badly cub town of black merino
they had the air or being father and daughter
marius scanned this old man who was not yet aged and this little girl who was not yet a person for a few days and thereafter paid no attention to them
they on their side did not appear even to see him
they conversed together with a peaceful and in different air
the girl shattered incessantly and merrily
the old man talked but little and at times he fixed on her eyes overflowing with an ineffable paternity
marius had qca hired the mechanical habit of strolling in that walk
he invariably found them there
this is the way things went marius liked to arrive by the end of the alley which was furthest from their bench he walked the whole length of the alley passed in front of them then returned to the extremity whence he had come and began again
this he did five or six times in the course of his promenade and the promenade was taken five or six times a week without its having occurred to him or to these people to exchange a greeting
that person age and that young girl although they appeared and perhaps because they appeared to shun all glances had naturally caused some attention on the part of the five or six students who strolled along the pepin ieee from time to time the studious after their lectures the others after their game of billiards
spurge trac who was among the last had observed them several times but finding the girl homely he had speedily and carefully kept out of the way
he had fled discharging at them a sobriquet like a parthian cart
impressed solely with the child's gown and the old man's hair he had dubbed the daughter mademoiselle la boite and the father monsieur le blanc so that as no one knew them under any other title this nickname became a law in the default of any other name
the students said am
monsieur le blanc is on his bench
and marius like the rest had found it convenient to call this unknown gentle man monsieur le blanc
we shall follow their example and we shall say m
leblanc in order to facilitate this tale
so marius saw them nearly every day at the same hour during the first year
he found the man to his taste but the girl in solid
chapter iii us fact west during the second year precisely at the point on this history which the reader has now reached it chanced that this habit of the luxembourg was interrupted without marius himself being quite aware why and nearly six months elapsed during which he did not set foot in the alley
one day at last he returned thither once more it was a serene summer morning and marius was in joyous mood as one is when the weather is fine
it seemed to him that he had in his heart all the songs of the birds that he was listening to and all the bits of blue sky of which he caught glimpses through the leaves of the trees
he went straight to his alley and when he reached the end of it be perceived still on the same bench that well known couple
only when he approached of certainly was the same man but it seemed to him that it was no longer the same girl
the person whom he now be held was a tall and beautiful creature possessed of all the most charming lines of a woman at the precise moment when they are still combined with all the most ingenious graces of the child a pure and fugitive moment which can be expressed only by these two words fifteen years
she had wonderful brown hair shaded with threads of gold and is that seemed made or marble cheeks that seemed made of rose leaf a pale flush an agitated whiteness an exquisite mouth whence smiles darted like sunbeams and words like music ahead such as raphael would have given to mary set up on a neck that mean you jon would have attributed to a venue
and in order that nothing might be lacking to this bewitching face her nose was not handsome it was pretty neither straight not curved neither italian nor greek it was the parisian nose that is to say spiritual delicate irregular pure which drives painters to despair and charm sports
when marius passed n father he could not see her eyes which were constantly powered
he saw only her long chestnut lashes permeated with shadow and modesty
this did not prevent the beautiful child from smiling as she listened to what the white haired old man was saying to her and nothing could be more fascinating than that fresh smile combined with those dropping eyes
for a moment marius thought that she was another daughter of the same man a sister of the former no doubt
but when the invariable habit of his stroll brought him for the second time near the bench and he had examined her attentively he recognized her as the same
in six months the little girl had become a young maiden that was all
nothing is more frequent than this phenomenon
there is a moment when girls blossom out in the twinkling of an eye and become roses all at once
one left them children but yesterday today one finds them disquieting to the feelings
this child had not only grown she had become idealized
as three days in april suffice to cover certain trees with flowers six months had sufficed to soothe her with beauty
her april had arrived
one sometimes sees people who poor and mean seem to wake up pass suddenly from indigence to luxury indulge in expenditures of all sorts and become dazzling prodigal magnificent all of a sudden
that is the result of having pocketed an income a note bellvue yesterday
the young girl had received her quarterly income
and then she was no longer the school girl with herself gather merino to enter scholar's shoes and red hands taste had come to her with beauty she was a well dresser person clad with a sort of rich and simple elegance and without affectation
she wore a dress of black damask scale of the same material and a bonnet of white craps
her white gloves displayed the delicacy of the hands bush toyed with the carved chinese ivory handle of a parasol and her silken shoe outlined the smallness of her foot
when one passed near her her whole toilette exhaled a youthful and penetrating perfume
as for the man he was the same as usual
the second time that marius approached her the young girl raised her eyelids her eyes were of a deep celestial blue but in that veiled azure there was as yet nothing but the glance of a child
she looked at marius in differently as she would have stared at the best running beneath the sycamores of the marble base which cast a shadow of the bench and marius on his side continued his promenade and thought about something else
he passed near the bench where the young girls at five or six times but without even turning his eyes inner direction
on the following day she returned as was his wont to the luxembourg as usual he found there the father and daughter but he paid no further attention to them
he thought no more about the girl now that she was beautiful than he had when she was homely
he passed very near the bench where she sat because such was his habit
chapter iii effect of the spring one day the air was warm the luxembourg was inundated with light and share the sky was a spode as though the angels had washed it that morning the sparrows were giving vent to lift pet sitters in the depths of the chestnut trees
marius had thrown open his whole soul to nature me was not thinking of anything he simply lived and breathed he passed near the bench the young girl raised her eyes to him the two glance smet
what was there in the young girl's glance on this occasion
marius could not have told
there was nothing and there was everything
it was a strange flash
she dropped her eyes and he pursued his way
what he had just seen was no longer the ingenuous and simple eye of a child it was a mysterious gulf which had half opened then abruptly closed again
there comes a day when the young girl glances in this manner
woe to him who chances to be there
that first gaze of a soul which does not as yet know itself is like the dawn in the sky
it is the awakening of something radiant and strange
nothing can give any idea of the dangerous charm of that unexpected gleam which flashes suddenly and vaguely forth from adorable shadows and which is composed of all the innocence of the present and of all the passion of the future
it is a sort of undecided tenderness which reveals itself by chance and which waits
it is a snare which the innocent maiden sets unknown to herself and in which she captures hearts without either wishing of knowing it
it is a virgin looking like a woman
it is rare that a profound revert does not spring from that glance where it falls
all purified and all candles meet in that celestial and fatal gleam which more than all the best planned tender glances of coquette's possesses the magic power of causing the sudden blossoming in the depths of the soul of that sombre flower impregnated with perfume and with poison which is called love
that evening on his return to bush's free marius cast his eyes over his garments and perceived for the first time that he had been so slovenly in decorous and inconceivably stupid as to go for his walk in the luxembourg with his everyday clothes that is to say with what battered near the band coarse carter's boots black trousers which showed white at the knees and a black coat which was pale at the elbows
chapter iv beginning of a great malady on the following day at the accustomed your marius grew from his wardrobe his new coat his new trousers his new hat and his new boots be clothed himself in this complete panoply put on his gloves a tremendous luxury and set off for the luxembourg
on the way thither he encountered source yeas and pretended not to see him
courts trac on his return home said to his friends i have just met marius' new hat and new coat with mario's inside them
he was going to pass an examination no doubt
he looked utterly stupid
on arriving at the luxembourg marius made the tour of the fountain basin and stared at the swans then he remained for a long time in contemplation before a statue whose head was perfectly black with mould and one of whose tips was missing
near the basin there was a bourgeois forty years of age with a prominent stomach who was holding by the hand a little urchin office and saying to him shun excess my son keep at an equal distance from despotism and from anarchy
marius listened to this bourgeois
then he made the circuit of the basin once more
atlas the directed his course towards his alley slowly and as it with regret
one would have said that he was both forced to go there and withheld from doing so
he did not perceive it himself and thought that he was doing as he always die
on turning into the walk he saw m
leblanc and the young girl at the other end of their bench
he buttoned his coat up to the very top pulled it down on his body so that there might be no wrinkles examined with a certain com plaisance the lustrous gleams of his trousers and marched on the bench
this march savored of an attack and certainly of a desire for conquest
so i say that he marched on the bench as i should say hannibal marches on rome
however all his movements were purely mechanical and he had interrupted none of the habitual preoccupations of his mind and labors
at that moment he was thinking that the manuel cuba vca laureate as a stupid book and that it must have been drawn up but are idiots to allow of these tragedies of racine and only one comedy of moliere being analyzed therein as masterpieces of the human mind
there was a piercing whistling going on in his ears
as he approached the bench he held fast to the folds in his coat and fixed his eyes on the young girl
it seemed to him that she filled the entire extremity of the alley with a vague blue light
in proportion as he drew near his laces is signed more and more
on arriving at some little distance from the bench and long before he had reached the end of the walk he halted and could not explain to himself why he retraced his steps
he did not even say to himself that he could not go as far as the end
it was only with difficulty that the young girl could have perceived him in the distance and noted his fine appearance in his new clothes
nevertheless he held himself very erect in case anyone should be looking at him from behind
he attained the opposite end then came back and this time he approached a little nearer to the bench
he even got to within three intervals of trees but there he felt an indescribable impossibility of proceeding further and he hesitated
he thought he saw the young girl's face bending towards him
but he exerted a manly and violent effort subdued his hesitation and walked straight ahead
a few seconds later he rushed in front of the bench erect and firm reddening to the very rare without daring to cast a glance either to the right or to the left with his hand thrust into his coat like a statesman
at the moment when he passed under the cannon of the place he felt his heartbeat wildly
as on the preceding day she wore her damask gown and her craps bonnet
he heard an ineffable voice which must have been her voice
she was talking tranquilly
she was very pretty
he felt it although he made no attempt to see her
she could not however he thought help feeling esteem and consider ation for me if she only knew that i am the veritable author of the dissertation on marcos obregon de la ronde which m
francois de neuf chateau out as though it were his own at the head of his edition of golf las
he went beyond the bench as far as the extremity of the wall which was very near then turned on his heel and passed once more in front of the lovely girl
this time he was very pale
moreover all his emotions were disagreeable
as he went further from the bench and the young girl and while his back was turned to her he fancied that she was gazing after him and that made him stumble
he did not attempt to approach the bench again he halted near the middle of the walk and there a thing which he never did he sat down and reflecting on the most profoundly in distinct depths of his spirit that after all it was hard that persons whose white bonnet and black gown he admired should be absolutely insensible to his splendid trousers and his new coat
at the expiration of a quarter of an hour he rose as though he were on the point of again beginning his march towards that bench which was surrounded by an aureole
but he remained standing there motionless
for the first time in fifteen months he said to himself that that gentleman who sat there every day with his daughter had on his side noticed him and probably considered his assiduity singular
for the first time also he was conscious of some irreverence in designating that stranger even in his secret thoughts by the sobriquet ibm
leblanc
he stood this for several minutes with dropping head trading figures in the sand with the same which he held in his hand
then he turned abruptly in the direction opposite to the bench tom
leblanc and his daughter and went home
that day he forgot to dine
at eighto'clock in the evening he perceived this fact and as it was too late to go down to the rue saint jacques he said nevermind
and are a bit of bread
he did not go to bed until he had brushed his coat and folded it up with great care
chapter v dives claps of thunder fallonma'am bouton on the following dayma'am bouton a scourge trac styled the old port read principal tenant house keeper of the gorge au novelma'am bouton whose name was in reality madame burton as we have found out but this iconoclast source trac respected nothingma'am bouton observed with style faction that m
marius was going out again in his new coat
he went to the luxembourg again but he did not proceed further than his bench midway of the alley
he seated himself the reason the preceding day surveying from a distance and clearly making out the white bonnet the black dress and above all that bluelight
he did not stir from it and only went home when the gates of the luxembourg closed
he did not seem
leblanc and his daughter retire
he concluded that they had quitted the garden by the gate on the rue del' ouest
later on several weeks afterwards when he came to think it over he could never recall where he had dined that evening
on the following day which was the thirdma'am bouton was thunderstruck
mark is went out in his new coat
three days in succession
she exclaimed
she tried to follow him but marius walked briskly and with immense strides it was a hippopotamus undertaking the pursuit of a chamois
she lost sight of him in two minutes and returned breathless three quarters choked with asthma and furious
if there is any sense she growled in putting on one's best clothes every day and making people run like this
marius betook himself to the luxembourg
the young girl was there with m
leblanc
marius approached as near as he could ptr tending to be busy reading a book but he halted afar off then returned and seated himself on his bench where he spent four hours in watching the house sparrows who were skipping about the walk and who produced on him the uml session that they were making sport of him
a fortnight passed thus
marius went to the luxembourg no longer for the sake of strolling there but to seat himself always in the same spot and that without knowing why
once arrived there he did not stir
he put on his new coat every morning for the purpose of not showing himself and he began all over again on the morrow
she was decidedly a marvellous beauty
the only remark approaching a criticism that could be made was that the contradiction between her gaze which was melancholy and her smile which was merry have weather wild effect to her face which spie times caused this sweet countenance to become strange without ceasing to be charming
chapter vi taken prisoner on one of the last days of the second week marius was seated on his bench as usual holding in his hand an open book of which he had not turned a page for the last two hours
all at once he started
an event was taking place at the other extremity of the walk
leblanc and his daughter had just left their seat and the daughter had taken her father's arm and both were advancing slowly towards the middle of the alley where marius was
marine closed his book then opened it again then forced himself to read he trembled the aureole was coming straight towards him
ay
good heavens
though the i shall not have time to stroke an attitude
still the white haired man and the girl advanced
it seemed to him that this lasted for a century and that it was cut a second
what are they coming in this direction for
he asked himself
what
she will pass here
her feet will tread this sandy his walk two paces from me
he was utterly upset he would have liked to be very handsome he would have liked to own the cross
he heard the soft and measured sound of their approaching footsteps
he imagined that m
leblanc was wanting angry glances at him
is that gentleman going to address me
he thought to himself
he dropped his head when he raised it again they were very near him
the young girl passed and as she passed she glanced at him
she gazed steadily at him with a pensive sweetness which thrilled marius from head to foot
it seemed to him that she was reproaching him for having allowed so long a time to elapse without coming as far as her and that she was saying to him i am coming myself
marius was dazzled by those eyes fraught with rays and abysses
he felt his brain on fire
she had come to him what joy
and then how she had looked at him
she appeared to him more beautiful than he had ever seen her yet
beautiful with a beauty which was wholly feminine and angelic with a complete beauty which would have made petrarch sing and dante kneel
it seemed to him that he was floating free in the azure heavens
at the same time he was horribly vexed because there was dust on his boots
he thought he felt sure that she had looked at his boots top
he followed her with his eyes until she disappeared
then he started up and walked about the luxembourg garden like a madman
it is possible that at times he laughed to himself and talked aloud
he was so dreamy when he came near the children's nurses that each one of them thought him in love with her
he quitted the luxembourg hoping to find her again in the street
he encountered source trac under the arcades of the odeon and said to him come and dine with me
they went off to rousseau's and spent six france
marius are like an ogre
he gave the waiters i ask us
at dessert he said to source trac
have you read the paper
what a fine discourse query depuy raves u delivered
he was desperately in love
after dinner he said to source track will treat you to the play
they went to the ports sainte martin to see frederick i'ml' auberge de sade ets
marius was enormously amused
at the same time he had a redoubled attack of shyness
on emerging from the theatre he refused to look at the garter of a modo che who was stepping across a gutter and source trac who said i should like to put that woman in my collection almost horrified him
source trax invited him to breakfast at the cafe voltaire on the following morning
marius want thither and she even more than on the preceding evening
he was very thoughtful and very merry
one would have said that he was taking advantage of every occasion to laugh uproariously
he tenderly embraced some major other from the provinces who was presented to him
a circle of students formed round the table and they spoke of the nonsense paid for by the state which was uttered from the rostrum in the sorbonne then the conversation fell upon the faults and omissions in gulch erat's fiction arias and grammars
marius interrupted the discussion to exclaim but it is very agreeable all the same to have the cross
that's queer
whispered source trac to jean proud aire
no responded proud sure that's serious
it was serious in fact marius had reached that first violent and charming hour with which grand passions begin
a glance had wrought all this
when the mind is charged when the conflagration is ready nothing is more simple
a glance is a spark
it was all over with him
marius loved a woman
his fate was entering the unknown
the glance of women resembles certain combinations of wheels which are tranquil in appearance yet formidable
you pass close to them everyday peaceably and with impunity and without a eu click on or anything
a moment arrived when you forget that the thing is there
you go and come dream speak laugh
all at once you feel yourself clutched all is over
the wheels hold you fact the glance has ensnared you
it has caught you no matter where it now by some portion of your thought which was fluttering loose by some distraction which had attacked you
you are lost
the whole of you passes into it
a chain of mysterious forces takes possession of you
you struggle in vain no more human succor is possible
you go on falling from hearing to grading from agony to agony from torture to torture you your mind your fortune your future your soul and according to whether you are in the power of a wicked creature or of a noble heart you will not escape from this terrifying machine otherwise than disfigured with shane or transfigured by passion
chapter vii adventures of the letter u delivered over to conjectures isolation detachment from everything price independence the taste of nature the absence of daily and material activity the life within himself the secret conflicts of chastity a benevolent ecstasy towards all creation had prepared marius for this possession which is called passion
his worship of his father had gradually become a religion and like all religions it had retreated to the depths of his soul
something was required in the foreground
livecam e
a full month elapsed during which marius went every day to the luxembourg
when the hour arrived nothing could hold him back
he is on duty said source trac
marius lived in a state of delight
it is certain that the young girl did look at him
he had finally grown bold and approaches the bench
still he did not pass in front of it anymore in obedience to the instinct of timidity and to the instinct of prudence common to lovers
he considered it better not to attract the attention of the father
he combined his stations behind the trees and the pedestals of the statues with a profound diplomacy so that he might be seen as much as possible by the young girl and as little as possible by the old gentleman
sometimes he remained motionless by the half hour to try begin the shade of a leonidas or a spartacus holding in his hands book above which his eyes gently raised sought the beautiful girl and she on her side turned her charming profile towards him with a vague smile
while conversing in the most natural and tranquil manner in the world with the white haired man she bent upon marius all the reveries of a virginal and passionate eur
ancient and time honored manoeuvre which eve understood from the very first day of the world and which every woman under's hands from the very first day of her life
her mouth replied to one and her fiance replied to another
it must be supposed that m
leblanc finally noticed something for often when marius arrived he rose and began to walkabout
he had abandoned their accustomed place and had adopted the bench by the gladiator near the other end of the walk as though with the object of seeing whether marius would pursue them thither
marius did not understand and committed this error
the father began to grow in exact and no longer brought his daughter every day
sometimes he came alone
then marius did not stay
another blunder
marius paid no need to these symptoms
from the phase of timidity he had passed by a natural and fatal progress to the phase of blindness
his love increased
he dreamed of it every night
and then an unexpected bliss has happened to him oil on the fire are doubling of the shadows over his eyes
one dvd king at dusk he had found on the bench which m
leblanc and his daughter had just quitted a handkerchief a very simple handkerchief without embroidery but white and fine and which seemed to him to exhale ineffable perfume
he seized it with rapture
this handkerchief was marked with the letters u
f
marius knew nothing about this beautiful child neither her family name her christian name mother above these two letters were the first thing of her that he bargained low session of adorable initials upon which he immediately began to construct his scaffolding
i was evidently the christian name
ursula
he thought what a delicious name
he kissed the handkerchief drank it in placed it on his heart on his flesh during the day and at night laid it beneath his lips that he might fall asleep on it
i feel that her whole soul lies within it
he exclaimed
this handkerchief belonged to the old gentleman who had simply let it fall from his pocket
in the date which followed the finding of this treasure he only displayed himself at the luxembourg in the act of kissing the handkerchief and laying it on his heart
the beautiful child understood nothing if all this and signified it to him by imperceptible signs
o modesty
said marius
chapter viii the veterans themselves can be happy since we have pronounced the word modesty and since we conceal nothing we ought to say that once nevertheless in spite of his ecstasies his urdu is caused him very serious grief
it was on one of the days when she persuaded m
leblanc to leave the bench and stroll along the walk
a brisk may freeze was blowing which swayed the crests of the plain gain trees
the father and daughter admin arm had just passed marius' bench
marius had risen to his feet behind them and was following them with his eyes as was fitting in the desperate situation of his soul
all at once a host of wind more merry than the rest and probably charged with performing the affairs of springtime swept down from the nursery flung itself on the alley enveloped the young girl in a delicious shiver worthy of virgil's nymphs and the fawns if theocritus and lifted her dress the to be more sacred than that of isis almost to the height of herr arter
a leg of exquisite shape appeared
marius saw it
he was exasperated and furious
the young girl had hastily thrust down her dress with a divinely troubled motion but he was nonetheless angry for all that
he was alone in the alley it is true
but there might have been someone there
and what if there had been someone there
can anyone comprehend such a thing
what she had just done is horrible
alas the poor child had done nothing there had been but one culprit the wind but marius in whom quivered the bar thilo who exists in cherubim was determined to be vexed and was jealous of his own shadow
it is thus in fact that the harsh and capricious jealousy of the flesh awakens in the human heart and takes possession of it even without any right
moreover setting aside even that jealousy the right of that charming leg had contained nothing agreeable for him the white stocking of the first woman he chanced to meet would have afforded him more pleasure
when his urdu le after having reached the end of the walk retraced her steps with m
leblanc and passed in front of the bench on which marius had seated himself once more mark i started a sullen and ferocious glance at her
the young girl gave way to that flight straightening up with a backward movement accompanied by a raising of the eyelids which signifies well what is the matter
this was their first quarrel
marius had hardly made this scene at her with his eyes when someone crossed the walk
it was a veteran very much bent extremely wrinkled and pale in a uniform of the louis xv
pattern bearing on his breast the little oval plaque of red cloth with the crossed swords the soldier's cross of saint louis and adorned in addition with a coat sleeve which had no arm within it with a silver shin and a wooden leg
marius though the perceived that this man had an extremely well satisfied air
it even struck him that the aged cynic as he hobbled a long past him addressed to him a very fraternal and very merry wink as though some chance had created an understanding between them and as though they had shared some piece of good luck together
what did that relic of mars mean by being so contented
what had passed between that wooden leg and the other
marius reached a paroxysm of jealousy
perhaps he was there
he said to himself perhaps he saw
and he felt a desire to exterminate the veteran
with the aid of time all points grow full
marius' wrath against ugsu is just and legitimate as it was passed off
he finally pardoned her but this cost him a greater for the sulked for three days
nevertheless in spite of all this and because of all this his passion augmented and grew to madness
chapter ix eclipse the reader has just seen how marius discovered or thought that he discovered that she was named yes ule
appetite grows with loving
to know that her name was urdu le was a great deal it was very little
in three or four weeks markus had devoured this blues
he wanted another
he wanted to know where she lived
he had committed his first blunder by falling into the ambush of the bench by the gladiator
he had committed a second by not remaining at the luxembourg when m
leblanc came thither alone
he now committed a third and an immense one
he followed it shoe
she lived in the rue del' ouest in the most in frequented spot in a new three story house of modest appearance
from that moment forth marius added to his happiness of seeing her at the luxembourg the happiness of following her home
his hunger was increasing
he knew her first name at least a charming name a genuine woman's name he knew where she lives he wanted to know who she was
one evening after he had followed them to their dwelling and had seen them disappear through the carriage gate he entered in their train and said boldly to the porter is that the gentleman who lives on the first floor who has just come in
no replied the porter
he is the gentleman on the third floor
another step gained
this success emboldened marius
on the front
he asked
par bleu
said the porter the house is only built on the street
and what is that gentleman's business
began marius again
he is a gentleman of property air
a very kind man who does good to the unfortunate though not rich himself
what is his name
resumed marius
the porter raised his head and said are you a police spy air
marius went off quite abashed but delighted
he was getting on
good though the i know that her name is urdu is that she is the daughter of a gentleman who lives on his income and that she lives there on the third floor in the rue del' ouest
on the following day m
leblanc and his daughter made only a very brief stay in the luxembourg they went away while it was still broad daylight
marius followed them to the rue del' ouest as he had taken up the habit of doing
on arriving at the carriage entrance m
leblanc made his daughter pass in first then paused before crossing the threshold and stared intently at marius
on the next day they did not come to the luxembourg
marius waited for them all day in vain
at nightfall he went to the rue del' ouest and saw a light in the windows of the third story
he walked about beneath the windows until the light was extinguished
the next day no one at the luxembourg
marius waited all day then went and did sentinel duty under their windows
this carried him into teno'clock in the evening
his dinner took care of itself
fever nourishes the sick man and love the lover
he spent a week in this manner
m
leblanc no longer appeared at the luxembourg
marius indulged in melancholy conjecture she dared not watch the ported of here during the day he contented himself with young at night to gaze upon the red light of the windows
at times he saw shadows foot across them and his heart began to beat
on the eighth day when he arrived under the windows there was no light in them
hello
he said the lamp is not lighted yet
but it is dark
can they have gone out
he waited until teno'clock
until midnight
until one in the morning
not a light appeared in the windows of the third story and no one entered the house
he went away in a very gloomy frame of mind
on the morrow to the only existed from morrow tomorrow there was so to speak to today for him on the morrow he found no one at the luxembourg he had expected this
at dusk he went to the house
no light in the windows the shares were drawn the third floor was totally dark
marius tapped at the ports costs reentered and said to the porter the gentleman on the third floor
has moved away replied the porter
marius heeled and said feebly how long ago
yesterday
where is he living now
idon't know anything about it
so he has not left his new address
no
and the porter raising his eyes recognized marius
come
so it's you
said he but you are decidedly a slut men
book seventh
patron time the chapter i mines and miners human societies all have what is called in theatrical parlance a third lower floor
the social skills everywhere undermined sometimes for good sometimes for evil
these works are superposed one upon their bed
there are superior mines and inferior mines
there is a top and a bottom in this obscure subsoil which sometimes gives way beneath civilization and which our indifference and needless news trample underfoot
the encyclopedia in the last century was a mind that was almost open to the sky
the shades those sombre hatcher's of primitive christianity only awaited an opportunity to bring about an explosion under the caesars and to inundate the human race with light
for in the sacred shadows therapies latent light
volcanoes are full of a shadow that is capable of flashing forth
every form begins by being night
the catacombs in which the first mass was said were not alone the cellar of rome they were the vaults of the world
beneath the social construction that complicated marvel of a structure there are excavations of all sorts
there is the religious mins the philosophical mine the economic mine the revolutionary mine
such and such a pickaxe with the idea such a pick with ciphers
such another with wrath
people gail and answer each other from one catacomb to another
utopias travel about underground in the pipes
there they branch out in every direction
they sometimes meet and frater bizet here
jean jacques lends his pick to diogenes who lends him his lantern
sometimes they enter into combat there
calvin seizes soci niue by the hair
but nothing arrests not interrupts the tension of all these energies toward the goal and the vast simultaneous activity which goes and comes mounts descends and mounts again in these obscurities and which immense unknown swarming slowly transforms the top and the bottom and the inside and the outside
society hardly even suspects this digging which leaves its surface intact and changes its bowels
there are as many different subterranean states as there are varying works as there are extractions
what emerges from these deep excavations
the future
the deeper one goes the more mysterious are the toilets
the work is good up to a degree which the social philosophies are able to recognize beyond that degree it is doubtful and mixed lower down it becomes terrible
at a certain depth the excavations are no longer penetrable by the spirit of civilization the limit breathable by man has been passed a beginning of monsters is possible
the descending scale is a strange one and each one of the rungs of this ladder corresponds to a stage where philosophy can find foothold and where one encounters one of these workmen sometimes divine sometimes misshapen
below john huss there is luther below luther there is descartes below descartes there is voltaire below voltaire there is condorcet below condorcet there is robespierre below robespierre there is mar at below mad at there is babe uf
and so it goes on
lower down confusedly at the limit which separates the indistinct from the invisible one perceives other gloomy men who perhaps do not exist as yet
the men of yesterday are spectres those of tomorrow are forms
the eye of the spirit distinguishes them but obscurely
the embryonic work of the future is one of the visions of philosophy
a world in limbo in the state of foetus what an unheard of spectra
saint simon owen fourier are there also in lateral galleries
surely although's divine and invisible chain unknown to themselves binds together all these subterranean pioneers who almost always think themselves isolated and who are not so their works very greatly and the light of some contrasts with the blaze of others
the first are paradisus cal the last are tragic
nevertheless whatever may be the contrast all these toilets from the highest to the most nocturnal from the wisest to the most fool jan possess one likeness and this is it disinterested news
marat for gets himself like jesus
they throw themselves on one side the fomit themselves they think not of themselves
they have a glance and that glance seems the absolute
the first use the whole heaven's in his eyes the last enigmatic although he may be had still beneath his eyelids the pale beam of the infinite
generate the man whoever he may be who has this sign the starry eye
the shadowy eye is the other sign
with it evil commences
reflect and tremble in the presence of anyone who has no glance at all
the social order has its black miners
there is a point where depth is tantamount to burial and where light becomes extinct
below all these mines which we have just mentioned below all these galleries below this whole immense subterranean venous system of progress and utopia much further on in the earth much lower than mar at lower than babe i flower much lower and without any connection with the upper levels there lies the last mine
a formidable spot
this is what we have designated as the key role of me dessous
it is the grave of shadows
it is the cellar of the blind
interi
this communicates with the abyss
chapter ii the lowest depths there disinterested ness vanishes
the demon is vaguely outlined each one is for himself
theo in the eyes howl's seeks fumbles and gnaws
the social url link is in this gulf
the wild spectres who roam in this grave almost beasts almost phantoms are not occupied with universal progress they are ignorant both of the idea and of the word they take no thought for anything but the satisfaction of their individual desires
they are almost unconscious and there exists within them a sort of terrible obliteration
they have two mothers both stepmother's ignorance and misery
they have a guide necessity and for all forms of satisfact job appetite
they are brutally voracious that is to say ferocious not after the fashion of the tyrant but after the fashion of the tiger
from suffering these spec trespass to crime fatal affiliation dizzy creation logic of darkness
that which crawls in the social third lower level is no longer complaint stifled by the absolute it is the protest of matter
man there becomes a dragon
to be hungry to be thirsty that is the point of departure to be satan that is the point reached
from that vault pac ensure emerges
we have just seen in book fourth one of the compartments of the upper mine of the great political revolutionary and philosophical excavation
there as we have just said ali is pure noble dignified honest
there assuredly one might be misled by terror is worthy of generation there so thoroughly does it imply heroism
the work there effected taken as a whole has a name progress
the moment has now come when we must take a look at other depths hideous depths
there exists beneath society we insist upon thus point and there will exist until that day when ignorance shall be dissipated the great cavern of evil
this cavern is below all and is the foe of all
it is hatred without exception
this cavern knows no philosophers it's dagger has never cut a pen
it's blackness has no connection with the sublime blackness of the ink stand
never have the fingers of night which contract beneath this stifling ceiling turned the leaves of a book nor unfolded a newspaper
babe it is a speculator to cartouche marat is an aristocrat to act under hannes
this cavern has for its object the destruction of everything
of everything
including the upper superior mines which i tea estates
it not only undermines in its hideous swarming the actual social order it undermines philosophy it undermines human thought it undermines civilization it undermines revolution it undermines progress
it's name is simply theft prostitution murder assassination
it is darkness and it desires chaos
it's vault is formed of ignorance
all the others those above it have but one object to suppress it
it is to this point that philosophy and progress tend with all their organs simultaneously by their amelioration of the real as well as by their contemplation of the absolute
destroy the cavern ignorance and you destroy the pairs time
let us condense in a few words a part of what we have just written
the only social peril is darkness
humanity is identity
all men are made of the same flat
there is no difference here below at least in predestination
the same shadow in front the same flesh in the present the same as he's afterwards
buy ignorance mingled with the human paste black endif
this incurable blackness takes possession of the interior of a man and is there converted into evil

one day at the period when he had his family with him in his booth on wheels he had read in the messager that a woman had just given birth to a child who was doing well and had a calf's muzzle and he exclaimed there's a fortune
my wife has not the wit to present me with a child like that
later on he had abandoned everything in order to undertake paris
this was his expression
who was clashes ous
he was night
he waited until the sky was daybed with black before he showed himself
at nightfall he emerged from the hole whither he returned before daylight
where was this hole
no one knew
he only addressed his accomplices in the most absolute darkness and with his back turned to them
was his name clashes ous
certainly not
if a candle was brought he put on a mask
he was a ventriloquist

no one was sure whether he had a name clashes ous being a sobriquet no new assure that he had a voice as his stomach spoke more frequently than his voice no one was sure that he had a face as he was never seen without his mask
he disappeared as though he had vanished into thin air when he appeared it was as though he sprang from the earth
a lugubrious being was montparnasse
montparnasse was a child less than twenty years of age with a handsome face lips like cherries charming black hair the brilliant light of springtime in his eyes he had all views and aspired to all crimes
the digestion of evil aroused in him an appetite for worse
it was the street boy turned pickpocket and a pickpocket turn edgar roger
he was genteel effeminate graceful robust sluggish ferocious
the rim of his hat was curled up on the left side in order to make room for a tuft of hair after the style of
he lived by robbery with violence
his coat was of the best cut but thread bags
montparnasse was a fashion plate in misery and given to the commission of murders
the cause of all this youth's crimes was the desire to be well dressed
the first grise the who had said to him you are handsome
had cast the stain of darkness into his heart and had made a cain of this abel
finding that he was handsome he desired to be elegant now the height of elegance is idleness idleness in a poor man means crime
few prowlers were so dreaded as montparnasse
at eighteen he had already numerous corpses in his past
more than one passerby lay with outstretched arms in the presence of this wretch with his face in a pool of blood
curled po hadad with laced waist the hips of a woman the bust of a prussian officer the murmur of admiration from the boulevard wenches surrounding him his arafat knowingly tied a bludgeon in his pockets flower in his buttonhole such was this dandy of the sepulchre
chapter iv composition of the troupe these four ruffians formed a sort of proteus winding like a serpent among the police and striving to escape vi docs's indiscreet glances under divers forms tree flame fountain lending each other their names and their traps hiding in their own shadows boxes with secret compartments and refuges for each other stripping off their personalities as one removes his false no seats masked ball sometimes simplifying matters to the point of consisting of but one individual sometimes multiplying themselves to such a point that coco la tour himself took them for a whole throng
these four men were not four men they were a sort of mysterio is robber with four heads operating on a grand scale in paris they were that monstrous polyp of evil which inhabits the crypt of society
thanks to their ramifications and to the network underlying their relations babergh rule meds la que si us and montparnasse were charged with the general enterprise or the ambushes of the department of the seine
the inventors of ideas of that nature men with nocturnal imaginations applied to them to have their ideas executed
they furnished the canvas to the four rascals and the latter undertook the preparation of the scenery
they labored at the stage setting
they were always in a condition to lend a force proportioned and suitable to all crimes which demanded a lift of the shoulder and which were sufficiently lucrative
when a crime was in quest of arms they under let their accomplices
they kept a troupe of actors of the shadows at the disposition of all underground tragedies
they were in the habit of assembling at nightfall the hour when they woke up on the plains which adjoin the sao perrier e
there they held their conferences
they had twelve black hours before them they regulated their employment accordingly
patron minette such was the name which was bestowed in the subterranean circulation on the association of these four men
in the fantastic ancient popular parlance which is vanishing day by day patron mind the signifies the morning the same as entre chiens top up between dog and wolf signifies the evening
this appellation patron minette was probably derived from the hour at which their work ended the dawn being the vanishing moment for phantoms and for the separation of ruffians
these four men were known under this title
when the president of the assizes visited lace naive in his prison and questioned him concerning a misdeed which laden air e denied who did it
demanded the president
las ensure made this response enigmatic also far as the magistrate was concerned but clear to the police perhaps it was patron minette
a piece can sometimes be divined on the enunciation of the personages in the same manner a band can almost be judged from the list of ruffians composing it
here are the appellations to which the principal members of patron minette answered for the names have survived in special memoirs

we pass over some and not the worst of them
these names have faded attached
they do not express merely being shut species
each one of these names corresponds to a variety of those misshapen fungi from the underside of civilization
those beings who were not very lavish with their countenances were not among the men whom one sees passing along the streets
fatigued by the wild nights which they passed they went off by day to sleep sometimes in the lime kiln's sometimes in the abandoned quarries of mo mt matte or montrouge sometimes in the sewers
they ran to earth
what became of these men
they still exist
they have always existed
horace speaks of the mahbub a karim col legi a pharmaco polar men dick mimas and so long as society remains what it is they will remain what they are
beneath the obscure roof of their cavern they are continually born again from the social ooze
they return spectres but always identical only they no longer bear the same names and they are no longer in the same skins

these men patiently pursue these bourgeois
they experience the quivers of a spider at the passage of a stranger of of a man from the country
these men are terrible when one encounters then it catches a glimpse of them towards midnight on a deserted boulevard
they do not seem to be men but forms composed of living mists one would say that they habitually constitute one mass with the shadows that they are in nowise distinct from them that they possess no other soul than the darkness and that it is only momentarily and for the purpose of living for a few minutes a monstrous life that they have separated from the night

book eighth
the wicked poor man chapter i marius while seeking a girl in a bonnet encounters a man in a cap summer passed then the autumn winter cams
neither m
leblanc nor the young girl had again set foot in the luxembourg garden
thenceforth marius had but one thought to gaze once more on that sweet and adorable face
he sought constantly he sought everywhere he found nothing
he was no longer marius the enthusiastic dreamer the firm resolute arden than the bold defied of date the brain which erected future on future the young spirit encumbered with plans with projects with pride with ideas and wishes he was a lost dog
he fell into a black melancholy
all was over
work disgusted him walking hired him
fast nature formerly so filled with forms lights voices counsel's perspectives horizons teachings now pay empty before him
it seemed to him that everything had disappeared
he thought incessantly for he could not do otherwise by the no longer took pleasure in his thoughts
to everything that they proposed to him in a whisper he replied in his darkness what is the use
he healed a hundred reproaches on himself
why did i follow her
i was so happy at the mere sight of her
she looked at me was not that immense
she had the air of loving me
was not that everything
i wished to have what
there was nothing after that
i have been absurd
it is my own fault etc.
etc.
source trac to whom he confided nothing it was his nature but who made some little guess at everything that was his nature had begun by congratulating him on being in love though he was amazed at it then seeing marius fall into this melancholy state he ended by saying to him i see that you have been simply an animal
here come to the chain ieee
once having confidence in a fine september sun marius had allowed himself to be taken to the ball at a crausby source trac bosquet and grants i're hoping what a dream
that he might perhaps find her there
of course he did not see the one he sought
but this is the place all the same where all lost women are found grumbled grant aide in an aside
marius left his friends at the ball and returned home on foot along through the night weary feverish with sad and troubled eyes stunned by the noise and dust of the merry way one filled with singing creatures on their way home from the feast which passed close to him as he in his discouragement breathed in the acrid scent of the walnut trees along the road in order to refresh his head
he took to living more and more alone utterly overwhelmed wholly given up to his inward anguish going and coming in his pain like the wolf in the trap seeking the absent one everywhere stupefied by love
on another occasion he had an encounter which produced on him a singular effect
he met in the narrow streets in the vicinity of the boulevard des invalides a man dressed like a working man and wearing a cap with a long visor which allowed a glimpse of locks of very white tait
marius was struck with the beauty of this white hair and scrutinized the man who was walking slowly and as though absorbed in painful meditation
strange to say he thought that he recognized m
leblanc
the hair was the same also the profile so far as the cap permitted a view of it the mien identical only more depressed
but why these workingman's clothes
what was the meaning of this
what signified that disguise
marius was greatly astonished
when he recovered himself his first impulse was to follow the man who knows whether he did not hold at last the clue which he was seeking
in any case he must see the man near at hand and clear up the mystery
but the idea occurred to him violate the man was no longer there
he had turned into some little side street and marius could not find him
this encounter occupied his mind for three days and then was effaced
after all he said to himself it was probably only a resemblance
chapter ii treasure trove marius had not left the gorge au house
he paid no attention to anyone there
at that epoch to tell the truth there were no other inhabitants in the house except himself and those kind fettes whose rent he had once paid without moreover ever having spoken to either father mother or daughters
the other lodgers had moved away or had died or had been turned out in default of payment
one day during that winter the sun had shown itself a little in the afternoon but it was the dog february that ancient candlemas day whose treacherous sun the precursor of a six weeks' cold spell inspired mathieu la ensberg with these two lines which made with justice remained classicqu'il luise ouqu'il luis de nel' ouest entre can send a caverns
markus had just emerged from his night was falling
it was the hour for his dinner for he had been obliged to take to dining again quad
oh infirmities of ideal passions
he had just crossed his threshold wherema'am bouton was sweeping at the moment as she uttered this memorable monologue what is there that is cheap now
everything is dead
there is nothing in the world that is cheap except trouble you can get that for nothing the trouble of the world
marius slowly ascended the boulevard towards the barrier in order to reach the rue saint jacques
he was walking along with dropping head
all at once he felt someone elbow him in the disk he wheeled round and saw two young girls clad in rags the install and slim the other a little shorter who were passing rapidly all out of breath in terror and with the appearance of fleeing they had been coming to meet him had not seen him and had jostled him as they passed
through the twilight marius could distinguish their livid faces their wild heads their dishevelled hair their hideous bonnets their ragged petticoats and their bare feet
they were talking as they ran
the taller said in a very low voice the bobbie's have come
they came near nagging me at the half circle
the other answered i saw them
i booted bolted bolted
through this repulsive slang markus understood that gendarmes of the police had come near apprehending these two children and that the latter had escaped
they plunged among the trees of the boulevard behind him and there created for a few minutes in the gloom a sort of vague white spot then disappeared
marius had halted for a moment
he was about to pursue his way when his eye lighted on a little grayish package lying on the ground at his feet
he stooped and picked it up
it was a sort of envelope which appeared to contain papers
good he said to himself those unhappy girls dropped it
he retraced his steps he called he did not find them here to sched that they must already be far away put the package in his pocket and went off to dine
on the way he saw in an alley of the rush out retard a child's coffin covered with a black cloth resting on three chairs and illuminated by a candle
the two girls of the twilight recurred to his mind
poor mother's
he thought
there is one thing sadder than to see one's children did it is to see them leading an evil life
then those shadows which had varied his melancholy vanished from his thoughts and he fell back once more into his habitual preoccupations
he fell to thinking once more of his six months of love and happiness in the open air and the broad daylight beneath the beautiful trees of luxembourg
how gloomy my life has become
he said to himself
young girls are always appearing time only formerly they were angels and now they are ghouls
chapter iii quadric tons that evening as he was undressing preparatory to going to her husband came in contact in the pocket of his coat with the packet which he had picked up on the boulevard
he had forgotten it
he thought that it would be well to open it and that this package might possibly contain the address of the young girls if it really belonged to them and in any case the information necessary to a restitution to the person who had lost it
he opened the envelope
it was not sealed and contained four letters also unsealed
they core addresses
all four exhaled a horrible odor of tobacco
the first was addressed to madame madame la marquis even richer at the place opposite the chamber of deputies no
marius said to himself that he should probably find in it the information which he sought and that moreover the letter being open it was probable that it could be read without impropriety
it was conceived as follows madame la marquise the virtue of clemency and piety is that which most closely united society
turn your christian spirit and cast a look of compassion in this unfortunate spanish victim of loyalty and attachment to the sacred cause of legitimacy who has given with his blood consecrated his fortune ev very thing to defend that cause and today finds himself in the greatest missed y
he doubts not that your honorable person will grant succor to preserve an existence water smelt painful for a military man of education and honor full of wounds counts in advance on the humanity which animated you and on the interest which madame la marquise bears to a national unfortunate
their prayer will not be in vain and their gratitude will preserve the irs charming souvenir
my respectful sentiments with which i have the honor to be madame dog alvarez spanish captain of cavalry a royalist who has take refuge in france who finds himself on travel is for his country and the resources are lacking him to continue his travel os
no address was joined to the signature
marius hoped to find the address in the second letter who seek perscription read a madame madame la comtesse de mont verne true cassette no
this is what marius read in it madame la comtesse it is an unhappy mother of a family of six children the last of which is only eight months old
i sick since my last confinement abandoned by my husband five months ago haveing no resources on the world the most frightful in finance
in the hope of madame la comtesse she has the honor to be madame with profound respect mistress bq lizard
marius turned to the third letter which was a petition like the preceding he read monsieur labour he or elector wholesale stocking merchant rue saint denis on the corner of the rue auster's
i permit myself to address you this letter to beg you to grant me the pre tools favor of yours in paris sand to interest yourself in a man of letters who has just sent a drama to the theatre francais
the subject is historical and the action takes place in auvergne in the time of the empire the style i think is natural laconic and may have some merit
there are couplets to be sung in four places
the comic the serious the unexpected are mingled in a variety of characters and a tinge of romanticism lightly spread through all the intrigue which proceeds mic tediously and ends after striking altar ations in the midst of many beautiful strikes of brilliant scenes
my principal object is to say is to the desire which progressively animates the man of our century that is to say the fashion that capri tions and bizarre weathervane which changes at almost every new wind
in spite of these qualities i have reason to fear that jealousy the egotism if priviliges authors may obtain e my exclusion from the theatre for i am not ignorant of the mortification's with which newcomers are treated
mon so keep a bourne of your just reputation as an enlightened protector of men of litters embolden sms to send you my daughter who will explain our one in any situation to you lacking bread and fire in this wynter season
when i say to you that i beg you to accept the dedication of my drama which i desire to make to you and of all those that i shall make is to prove to you how great is my ambition to have the honor of sheltering myself under your protection and of adorning my writings with your name
if you deign to honor me with the most more stored ring i shall immediately occupy myself in making a please of verse to pay you my tribute of gratitude
which i shall endeavor to render this piece was perfect as possible will be sent to you before it is inserted at the beginning of the drama and delivered on the stage
to monsieur and madame labour felt my most respectful complements ten foot man of letters
p
s
even if it is only for the ous
excuse me for sending my daughter and not presenting myself but sad motives connected with the toilet do not permit me alas
to go out
finally marius opened the fourth letter
the address ran to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques du haut pas

fagan you dramatic artist
after per using these four letters marius did not find himself much further advanced than before
in the first place not one of the signers gave his address
then they seemed to come from four different individuals donal vegas mistress ball z add the poet ten foot and dramatic artist cavan you but the singular thing about these letters was that all four were written by the same hand
what conclusion was to be drawn from this except that they all come from the same person
moreover and this rendered the conjecture all the more probable the coarse and yellow paper was the same in all four theodor of tobacco was the same and although an attempt had been made to vary the style the same orthographic al faults were reproduced with the greatest tranquillity and the man of letters ten foot was no more exempt from them than the spanish captain
it was waste of trouble to try to solve this petty mystery
had it not been a chance find it would have borne the air of a mystification
marius was too melancholy to take even a chance pleasantry well and to lend himself to a game which the pavement of the street seemed desirous of playing with him
it seemed to him that he was playing the part of the blind man in blind man's buff between the four letters and that they were making sport of him
nothing however indicated that these letters belonged to the two young girls whom marius had met on the boulevard
after all they were evidently papers of no value
marius replaced them in their envelope flung the whole into a corner and went to bed
about seveno'clock in the morning he had just risen and breakfasted and was trying to settle down to work when there came a soft knock at his door
as he owned nothing he never locked his door unless occasionally though very rarely when he was engaged in some pressing work
even when absent he left his key in the lock
you will be robbed saidma'am bouton
of ag ah
sale marius
the truth is however that he had one day been robbed of an old pair of boots to the great triumph ofma'am bouton
there came a second knock as gentle as the first
come in said marius
the door opened
what do you wantma'am bouton
asked marius without raising his eyes from the books and manuscripts on his table
a voice which did not belong toma'am bouton replied excuse me sir it was a full broken hoarse strangled voice the voice of an old man roughened with brandy and liquor
marius turned round hastily and beheld a young girl
chapter iv arose in misery illustration rose in misery brose in misery a very young girl was standing in the half open door
the dormer window of the garret through which the light fell was precisely opposite the door and illuminated the figured it has an light
she was a frail emaciated slender creature there was nothing but a chemise and a petticoat upon that chilled and shivering nakedness
her girdle was a string her head ribbon a string her pointed shoulders emerged from her chemise a blind and lymphatic pallor earth colored collarbone seed hands a half open and degraded mouth missing teeth will hold base eyes she had the form of a young girl who has missed her youth and the look of a corrupt old woman fifty years mingled with fifteen one of those beings which are both feeble and horrible and which cause those to shudder whom they do not cause to weep
marius has risen and was staring in a sort of stupor at this being who was almost like the forms of the shadows which traverse dreams
the most heartbreaking thing of all was that this young girl had not come into the world to be homely
in her early childhood she must even have been pretty
the grace of her age was still struggling against the hideous premature decrepitude of debauchery and poverty
the remains of beauty were dying away in that face of sixteen like the pale sunlight which is extinguished under hideous clouds at dawn on a winter's day
that face was not wholly unknown to marius
he thought he remembered having seen it somewhere
what do you wish mademoiselle
he asked
the young girl replied in her voice of a drunken convict here is a letter for you monsieur marius
she called marius by his name he could not doubt that he was the person whom she wanted but who was this girl
how did she know his name
without waiting for him to tell her to advance she entered
she entered resolutely sharing with a sort of assurance that made the heart bored at the whole room and the un made bed
her feet were bare
large holes in her petticoat permitted glimpses of her long legs and her think news
she was shivering
she held a letter in her hand which she presented to marius
marius as he opened the letter noticed that the enormous water which sealed it was still moist
the message could not have come from a distance
he read my amiable neighbor young man i have learned of your goodness to me that you paid my rent six months ago
i bless you youngman
my eldest daughter will tell you that we have been without a morsel of bread for two days four persons and my spouse ill
if i am not be seabed in my opinion i think i may hope that your generous heart will melt at this statement and the desire will subjugate you to be propitious to me by a signing to lavish on me a slight favor
i am with the distinguished consideration which is due to the benefactors of humanity ion frette
p
s
my eldest daughter will await your orders dear monsieur marius
this letter coming in the very midst of the mysterious adventure which has occupied marius' thoughts ever since the preceding evening was like a candle in a cellar
all was suddenly illuminated
this letter came from the same place as the other four
there was the same writing the same style the same orthography the same paper the same odor of tobacco
there were five missives five histories five signatures and a single signed
the spanish captain ron alvarez the unhappy mistress balls are the dramatic post ten foot the old comedian fagan you were all four named jon dee their indeed monde et he himself were named jon dee the
marius had lived in the house for a tolerably long time and he had had as we have said but very rare occasion to see to even catch a glimpse of his extremely mean neighbors
his mind was elsewhere and where the mind is there the eyes are also
he had been obliged more than once to pass them on fretted in the corridor or on the stairs but they were here for me to him he had paid so little heed to them that on the preceding evening he had jostled the jon dee the girls on the boulevard without recognizing them for it had evidently been they and it was with great difficulty that the one who had just entered his room had awakened in him in spite of disgust and pity a vague recollection of having met her elsewhere
now he saw everything clearly
he understood that his neighbor jon dee the in his distress exercised the industry of speculating on the charity of benevolent persons that he procured addresses and that he wrote under feigned names to people whom he judged to be wealthy and compassionate letters which his daughters delivered at their risk and peril for this father had come to such a laws that he risked his daughter she was playing a game with fate and he used them as the stake
marius understood that probably judging from their blight on the evening before from their breathless condition from their terror and from the words of slang which he had overheard these unfortunate creatures we replying some inexplicably sad profession and that the result of the whole was in the midst of human society as it is now constituted two miserable beings who were neither girls hot women a species of impure and innocent monsters produced by misery
sad creatures without name or sex of age to whom neither good note vii were any longer possible and who on emerging from childhood have already nothing in this world neither liberty nor virtue big deal of sibility
souls which blossomed out yesterday and are faced today like those flowers let fall in the streets which are soiled with every sort of more while waiting for some wheel to crush them
nevertheless while marius betta pained and astonished gaze on her the young girl was wandering back and forth in the garden with the audacity of a spectre
she kicked about without troubling herself as to her nakedness
occasional other chemise which was untied and form fell almost to her waist
she moved the chairs about shed is arranged the toilet articles which stood on the commode she handled marius' clothes she rummaged about to see what there was in the corners
hullo
said she you have a mirror
and she hummer scrape of vaudeville's as though she had been alone frolic some refrains which her hoarse and guttural voice rendered lugubrious
an indescribable constraint weariness and humilis tion were perceptible beneath this hardihood
effrontery is a disgrace
nothing could be more melancholy than to see her sport about the room and so to speak to it with the movements of a bird which is frightened by the daylight or which has broken its wing
one felt that under other conditions of education and destiny the gay and over free mien of this young girl might have turned out sweet and charming
never even among animals does the creature born to be adobe change into an osprey
that is only to be seen among men
marius reflected and allowed her to have her way
she approached the table
ah
said she books
's flash pierced her glass keys
she resumed and her accent expressed the happiness which she felt in boasting of something to which no human creature is insensible i know how to read ido
she eagerly seized a book which lay open on the table and read with tolerable fluency general nauru in received orders to take the chateau if you go mont which stands in the middle of the plain of water poo with five battalions of his brigade
she paused
ah
waterloo
i know about that
it was a battle long ago
my father was there
my father has served in the armies
we are fine bona p artists in our house that we are
waterloo was against the english
she laid down the book caught up a pen and exclaimed and i know how to write top
she dipped her pen in the ibm and turning to marius do you want to see
look here i'm going to write a word to show you
and before he had time to answer she wrote on a sheet of white paper which lay in the middle of the table the bubbles are here
then throwing down the pen there are no faults of orthography
you can look
we have received an education my sister and i
we have not always been as we are now
we were not made here she paused v used her full eyes on marius and burst out laughing saying with an intonation which contained every form of anguish stifled by every form of cynicism bag
and she began to him these words to a gay airj'ai gain mohler e
i am hungry father
pasd' errico t
i have no food
j'ai froid james e.
i am cold mother
pas de tricot
i have no clothes
g report elliotte
polo the
shivers any lifes of jacquot
jacquot
she had hardly finished this couplet when she exclaimed do you ever go to the play monsieur marius
i do
i have a little brother who is a friend of the artists and who gives me tickets sometimes
but idon't like the benches in the galleries
one is cramped and uncomfortable there
there are rough people there sometimes and people who smell bad
then she scrutinized marius assumes a singular air and said do you know me
marius that you are a very handsome fellow
and at the same moment the same idea occurred to them both and made her smile and him blush
she stepped up to him and laid her hand on his shoulder you pay no need to me but i know you mr.
marius
i meet you here on the staircase and then i often see you going to a person named father man eur who lives in the direction of austerlitz sometimes when i have been strolling in that quarter
it is very be coming to you to have your hair tumbled this
she tried to render her voice soft but only succeeded in making it very deep
a portion of her words was lost in the transit from her larynx to her lips as though on a piano where some notes are missing
marius had retreated gently
mademoiselle said he with his cool gravity i have here a package which belongs to you i think
permit me to return it to you
and he held out the envelope containing the four letters
she slapped her hands and exclaimed we have been looking everywhere for that
then she eagerly seized the package and opened the envelope saying as she did so divided if u
how my sister and i have hunted
and it was you who found it
on the boulevard was it not
it must have been on the boulevard
you see we let it fall when we were running
it was that beat of a sister of mine who was so stupid
when we got home we could not find it anywhere
as we did not wish to be beaten as that is useless as that is entirely useless as that is absolutely useless we said that we had carried the letters to the proper persons and that they had said to us' mix
' so here they are those poor letters
and how did you find out that they belonged to me
ah
yes the writing
so it was your gates jostled as we passed last night
we couldn' tafe
i said to my sister' if it a gentleman
' my sister said to me' i think it is a gentleman
' on the meanwhile she has unfolded the petition addressed to the benevolent gentlemen of the church of saint jacques du haut pas
here
said she this is for that old fellow who goes to mass
by the way this is his hour
i'll go and carry it to him
perhaps he will give us something to breakfast on
then she began to laugh again and added do you know what it will mean it we get a breakfast today
it will mean that we shall have had our breakfast of the day before yesterday our breakfast of yesterday out winner of today and all that at once and this morning
come
o arg leu
if you are not satisfied dogs burst
this reminded marius of the wretched girl's errand to himself
he fumbled in his waistcoat pocket and found nothing there
the young girl went on and seemed to have no consciousness of marius' presence
i often go off in the evening
sometimes idon't come home again
last winter before we came here we lived under the arches of the bridges
we huddled together to keep from freezing
my little sister cried
how melancholy the water is
when i thought of drowning myself i said to myself' no it's too cold
' i go out alone whenever i choice i sometimes sleep in the witches
so you know at night when i walk along the boulevard i see the trees like forks i see houses all black and as finds notre dame i fancy that the white walls are the river i say to myself' why there's water there
' the stars are like the lamps in illuminations one would say that they smoked and that the wind blew them out i am bewildered as though horses were breathing in my ears although it is night i hearn and organs and spinning machines and idon't know what all
i think people are clinging stones at me if lee without knowing whither everything whirls and whirls
you feel very queer when you have had no food
and then she stared at him with a bewildered air
by dint of searching and ransacking his pockets marius had finally collected five france sixteen sous
this was all he owned in the world for the moment
at all events he thought there is my dinner for today and tomorrow we will see
he kept the sixteen sous and handed the five france to the young girl
she seized the coin
good
said she the sun is shining
and as though the sun had possessed the property of melting the avalanches of slang in her brain she went on five france
the shiner
a monarch
in this hole
ain't this fine
you're a jolly thief
i'm your humble servant
bravo for the good fellows
two days' wine
and meat
and stew
we'll have a royal feast
and a good fill
she pulled her chemise upon her shoulders made a los how to mark is then a familiar sign with her hand and went towards the door saying good morning air
it's allright
i'll go and find my old man
as she passed she caught sight of a dry crust of bread on the commode which was moulding there amid the dust she flung her self upon it and fit into it muttering that's good
it's hard
it breaks my teeth
then she departed
chapter v a providential peephole marius had lived for five years in poverty in destitution even in distress but he now perceived that he had not known real misery
true misery he had but just had a view of
it was it's spectre which had just passed before his eyes
in fact he who has only be held the misery of man has seen nothing the misery of dimen is what he must see he who has seen only the misery of woman has seen nothing he must see the misery of the child
when a man has reached his last extremity he has reached his last resources at the same time
woe to the defenceless beings who surround him
work wages bread fire courage goodwill all fail him simultaneously
the light off systems extinguished without the moral light within in these shadows man encounters the feebleness of the woman and the child and bends them violently to ignominy
then all mirrors become possible
despair is surrounded with fragile partitions which all open on either vic for crime
health youth honor all the shy delicacies of the young body the heart virginity modesty that epidermis of the soul are manipulated in sinister wide by that fumbling which seeks resources which encounters opprobrium and which accommodates itself to it
father's mother's children brothers sisters men women daughters ad here and become incorporated almost like a mineral formation in that dusky promiscuous ness of sexes relationships ages in famie's and innocence s
they crouch back to back in a sort of hut of date
they exchanged or be gone glances
on the unfortunate wretches
how pale they are
how cold they are
it seems as though they dwelt in a planet much further from the sun than ours
this young girl was to marius a sort of messenger from the realm of sad shadows
she revealed to him a hideous side of the night
marius almost reproached himself for the preoccupations of revert and passion which had prevented his bestowing a glance on his neighbors up to that day
the payment of their rent had been a mechanical movement which anyone would have yielded to by the marius should have done better than that
what
only a wall separated him from those abandoned beings who lived groping it in the dark outside the pale of the rest of the world he was elbow to elbow with them he was in some sort the last link of the human race which they touched he heard them live or rather rattle in the death agony beside him and he paid no need to them
every day every instant he heard them walking on the other side of the wall he heard them go and come and speak and he did not even lend a near
and groans lay in those words and he did not even listen to them his thoughts were elsewhere given up to dreams to impossible radiance who lives in the air to follies and all the whole human creatures his brothers in jesus christ his brothers in the people were agonizing in vain beside him
he even formed a part of their misfortune and he aggravated it
for if they had had another neighbor who was less chimerical and more attentive any ordinary and charitable may evidently their indigence would have been noticed their signals of distress would have been perceived and they would have been taken hold of and rescued
they appeared very corrupt and very depraved no doubt very file very odious even but those who fall without becoming degraded are rare besides there is a point where the unfortunate and the infamous unite and are confounded in a single word a fatal wird the miserable whose fault is this
and then should not the charity be all the more profound in proportion as the fall is great
while reading himself this moral lesson for there were occasions on which marius like all truly honest hearts was his own pedagogue and scolded himself more than he deserved he stared at the wall which separated him from the kind terres as though he were able to make his gaze full of pity penetrate that partition and warm these wretched people
the wall was a thin layer of plaster upheld by lathes and beams and as the reader had just learned it allowed the sound of voices and words to be clearly distinguished
only a man as dream yes marius could have failed to perceive this long before
there was no paper pasted on the wall either on the side of the lord re tresor on that of marius the coarse construction was visible in it's nakedness
marius examined the partition almost unconsciously sometimes're very examined observes and scrutinize was thought would
all at once he sprang up he had just perceived near the top close to the ceiling a triangular hole which resulted from the space between three lathes
the plaster which should have filled this cavity was missing and by mounting on the commode a view could be had through this aperture into the kind rented' attic
commiseration has and should have it's curiosity
this aperture formed a sort of peephole
it is permissible to gaze at misfortune like a traitor in order to succor it
let us get some little idea of what these people are like thought marius and in what condition they are
he climbed up on the commode put his eye to the crevice and looked
chapter vi the wild man in his lair cities like forests have their caverns in which all the most wicked and formidable creatures which they contain conceal themselves
only in cities that which thus conc wake itself is ferocious unclean and petty that is to say ugly in forests that which conceals itself is ferocious savage and grand that is today beautiful
taking one pair with another the beast's is preferable to the man's
caverns are better than novels
what marius now be held was shovel
marius was poor and his chamber was poverty stricken but as his poverty was noble his target was neat
the den upon which his eye how tested was abject dirty get isles tiberius mean sordid
the only furniture consisted of a straw chair an inform table some old bits of crockery and in two of the corners two indescribable pallets all the light was furnished by a dormer window of four pages draped with spiders' webs
through this aperture there penetrated just enough light to make the face of a man appear like the face of a phantom
the walls had a leprous aspect and were covered with seams and sears like a gis and disfigured by some horrible malady a repulsive moisture exuded from them
obscene sketches roughly sketched with charcoal could be distinguished upon them
the chamber which marius occupied had a dilapidated brick pavement this one was neither tiled not plank rd its inhabitants stepped directly on the antique plaster of the novel which had grown black under the long continued pressure of feet
upon this uneven floor where the dirt seemed to be fairly in crushed and which possessed but one virginity that of the broom were capriciously grouped constellations of old shoes socks and repulsive tags however this room had a fireplace so it was let for forty francs a year
there was every sort of thing in that fireplace a brazier a lot broken boards days suspended from nails a bird cage ashes and even a little fire
two brands were smouldering there in a melancholy way
one thing which added still more to the horrors of this garret was that it was large
it had projections and angles and black holes the lower sides of roofs bays and prom on tories
hence horrible unfathomable books where it seemed as though spiders as big as one's fist wood life as large as one's foot and perhaps even who knows
some monstrous human beings must be hiding
one of the pallets was near the door the other near the window
one end of each touched the fireplace and faced marius
in a corner near the aperture through which marius was gazing a colored engraving on a black frame was suspended to a nail on the wall and at its bottom in large letters was the inscription the dream
this represented a sleeping woman and a child also asleep the child on the woman's lap an eagle in a cloud with a crown in his beak and the woman thrusting the crown away from the child's head without a waking the latter in the background napoleon in a glory leaning on a very blue column with a yellow capital ornamented with this inscription mar into austerlitz lenses grammer lot beneath this frames sort of wooden panel which was no longer than it was broad stood on the ground and rested in a sloping attitude against the wall
it had the appearance of a picture with its face turned to the wall of a frame probably showing a day bon the other side of some pier glass detached from a wall and lying forgotten there while waiting to be re hung
near the table upon which marius descried a pen ink and papers at a man about sixty years of age small think i did haggard with a cunning cruel and uneasy air a hideous scoundrel
if lava her had studied this visage he would have found the culture mingled with the attorney there the bird of prey and the pet to finger rendering each other mutually hideous and complementing each other the part of other making the bird of prey ignoble the bird of prey making the pettit other horrible
this man had a long gray beard
he was clad in a woman's chemise which allowed his hairy breast and his bare arms bristling with gray hair to be seen
beneath this chemise muddy trousers and boots through which his toes projected were visible
he had a pipe in his mouth and was smoking
there was no bread in the hotel but there was still tobacco
he was writing probably some more letters like those which marius had read
on the corner of the table lay an ancient dilapidated reddish volume and the size which was the antique mood reading rooms betrayed a romance
in the cover sprawled the following title printed in large capital show the king honor and the ladies by duc gay cum in il
as the man wrote he talked a loud and marius heard his words the idea that there is no equality even when you are dead
just look at pere lachaise
the great those who are rich and up above in the acadia alley which is paved
they can reach it in a carriage
the little people the poor the unhappy well what of them
they are put down below where the mud is up to your knees in the damp places
they are out there so that they will decay the sooner
you can not go to see them without sinking into the earth
he paused's note the table with his fist and added as he ground his teeth on
i could eat the whole world
a big woman who might be forty years of age or a hundred was crouching near the fireplace in her bare heels
she too was clad only in a chemise and a knitted petticoat patched with bits of old cloth
a coarse linen apron concealed the half of her petticoat
although this woman was doubled up and bent together it could be seen that she was of very lofty stature
she was a sort of giant beside her husband
she had hideous hair of a reddish blond which was turning gray and which she thrust back from time to time with her enormous shining hands with their flat nails
beside her on the flood wide open lay a book of the same form as the other and probably a volume of the same romance
on one of the pallets marius caught a glimpse of a sort of tall pale young girl who sat there half naked and with pendant feet and who did not seem to be listening ordering of living
no doubt the younger sister of the one who had come to his room
she seemed to be eleven or twelve years of age
on closer scrutiny it was evident that she really was fourteen
she was the child who had said on the boulevard the evening before i bolted bolted bolted
she was of that puny sort which remains backward for a long time then suddenly starts up rapidly
it is indigence which produces these melancholy humano pants
these creatures have neither childhood not youth
at fifteen years of age they appear to be twelve at sixteen they seem twenty
today a little girl tomorrow a woman
one might say that they strive through life in order to get through with it the more speedily
at this moment this being had the air or a child
moreover no trace of work was revealed in that dwelling no handicraft no spinning wheel not a tool
in one corner lay some ironmongery of dubious aspect
it was the full listlessness which follows despair and precedes the death agony
marius gazed for a while at this gloomy interior more terrifying than the interior of a tomb for the human soul could be felt cluttering there and life was palpitating there
the garret the cellar the lowly ditch where certain indigent wretches crawl at the very bottom of the social edifice is not exactly the sepulchre but only its antechamber but as the wealthy display their greatest magnificence at the entrance of their palaces it seems that death which stands directly side by side with them places it's greatest miseries in that vestibule
the man held his peace the woman spoke no word the young girl did not even seem to breathe
the scratching of the pen on the paper was audible
the man grumbled without pausing in his writing
can allow
can wille
everybody is can wille
this variation to solomon's exclamation elicited a sign from the woman
calm yourself my little friends he said
don't hurt yourself my dear
you are too good to write to all those people husband
bodies press close to eachother in misery as in told by the arts draw a part
this woman must have loved this man to all appearance judging from the amount of love within her but probably in the daily and reciprocal reproaches of the horrible distress which weighed on the whole group this has become extinct
there no longer existed in her anything more than the ashes of affection for her husband
nevertheless caressing appellations had survived as is often the case
she called him my dear my little friend my goodman etc.
with her mouth while her heart was silent
the man resumed his writing
chapter vii strategy and tactics marius with a load upon his breast was on the point of descending from the species of observatory which he had improvised when a sound attracted his attention and caused him to remain at his post
the door of the attic had just burst open abruptly
the eldest girl made her appearance on the threshold
on her feet she had large coarse men's shoes vespa the red with mud which had splashed even find free ankles and she was wrapped in an old mantle which hung in tatters
marius had not seen it on her an hour previously but she had probably deposited it at his door in order that she might inspire the more pity and had picked it up again on emerging
she entered pushed the door to behind her paused to take breath for she was completely breathless then exclaimed with an expression of triumph and joy he is coming
the father turned his eyes towards her the woman turned her head the little sister did not stir
who
demanded her father
the gentleman
the philanthropist
yes
from the church of saint jacques
yes
that old fellow
yes
and he is coming
he is following me
you are sure
i am sure
there truly he is coming
he is coming in afi acre
in afi acre
he is rothschild
the father rose
how are you sure
if he is coming in afi acre how is it that you arrive before him
you have to your address at least
did you tell him that it was the last door at the end of the corridor on the right
if he only does not make a mistake
do you found him at the church
fiche read my letter
what did he say to you
ta ta ta said the girl how you do gallop on my goodman
see here i entered the church he was in his usual place i made him a reverence and i handed him the letter he read it and said to me' where do you live my child
' i said' monsieur i will show you
' he said to me' no give me your address my daughter has some purchases to make i will take a carriage and reach your house at the same time that you do
' i gave him the address
when i mentioned the house he seemed surprised and hesitated for an instant then he said' never mind i will cons
' when the mass was finished i watched him leave the church with his daughter and i saw them enter a carriage
i certainly did tell him the last door in the corridor on the right
and what makes you think that he will come
i have just seen the disc return into the rue petit ban quiet
that is what made me runs o
how do you know that it was the same road fe
because i took notice of the numbers others
what was the number
good you are a clever girl
the girl stated boldly at her father and showing the shoes which she had on herbert a clever girl possibly but i tell you idon't put these shoes on again and that idon't for the sake of my health in the first place and for the sake of cleanliness in the next
idon't know anything more irritating than shows that squelch and got high in to the whole time
i prefer to go barefoot
you are right said her father in a sweet tone which contrasted with the young girl's rudeness but then you will not be allowed to enter churches for poor people must have shoes to do that
one can not go barefoot to the good god he added bitterly
then returning to the subject which absorbed him so you are sure that he will come
he is following on my heels said she
the man started up
a sort of illumination appeared on his countenance
wife
he exclaimed you hear
here is the philanthropist
extinguish the fire
the stupefied mother did not stir
the father with the ability of an acrobat seized a broken nose chug which stood on the chimney and flung the water on the brands
then addressing his eldest daughter here you
pull the straw off that chair
his daughter did not understand
he seized the chair and with one kick be rendered its eat less
his leg passed through it
as he withdrew his leg he asked his daughter is it sold
very cold
it is snowing
the father turned towards the younger girl who sat on the bed near the window and shouted to her in a thunder one voice quick
get off that bed you last thing
will you never do anything
break spans of glass
the little girl jumped off the bed with a driver
breaks lane
he repeated
the child stood still in bewilderment
do you hear me
repeated her father i tell you to break a page
the child with a sort of terrified obedience else on tiptoe and struck a page with her fist
the glass broke and fell with a loud clatter
good said the father
he was grave and abrupt
his glance swept rapidly over all the crannies of the garden
one would have said that he was a general making the final preparation at the moment when the battle is on the point of beginning
the mother who had not said a word so fat now rose and demanded in a full slow languid voice whence her words seemed to emerge in a congealed state what do you mean to do my dear
get into bed replied the man
his intonation admitted or no deliberation
the mother obeyed and threw herself heavily on one of the pallets
in the meantime a son became audible in one corner
what's that
cried the father
the younger daughter exhibited her bleeding fish without quitting the corner in which she was cowering
she had wounded herself while breaking the windows he went off near her mother's pallet and wept silently
it was now the mother's turn to start up and exclaim just see there
what follows you commit
she has cut herself breaking that page for you
so much the better
said the man
i foresaw that
what
so much the better
retorted his wife
peace
replied the father i suppress the liberty of the press
then tearing the woman's chemise which he was wearing he made a strip of cloth with which he hastily swathed the little girl's bleeding wrist
that done his eye fell with a satisfied expression on his horn chemise
and the chemise too said he this has a good appearance
an icy breeze whistled through the window and entered the room
the outermost penetrated thither and diffused itself like a whitish sheet of wadding vaguely spread by invisible fingers
through the broken owns the snow could be seen falling
the snow promised by the candlemas sum of the preceding day had actually come
the father cast a glance about him as though to make sure that he had forgotten nothing
he seized an old shovel and spread ashes over the wet brands in such a manner as to eng italy conceal them
then drawing himself up and leaning against the chimney piece now said he we can receive the philanthropist
chapter viii the day of light in the novel the big girl approached and laid her hand in her father's
feel how cold i am said she
bah
replied the father i am much colder than that
the mother exclaimed impetuously you always have something better than anyone else so you do
even bad things
down with you
said the man
the mother being eyed after a certain fashion half her tongue
silence reigned for a moment in the novel
the elder girl was removing the mud from the bottom of her mantle with a careless air her younger sister continued to sob the mother has taken the latter's head between her hands and was covering it with kisses whispering to her the whole my treasure i entreat you it is not hint of consequencedon't cry you will anger your father
no
exclaimed the father quite the contrary
son
son
that's right
then turning to the elder there now
he is not coming
what if he were not to come
i shall have extinguished my fire wrecked my chair hornby shirt and broken my page all for nothing
and wounded the child
murmured the mother
do you know went on the father that it's beastly cold in this devil's garret
what if that man should not come
oh
see there you
he makes us wait
he says to himself' well
they will wait for me
that's what they're there for
' on
how i hate them and with what you jubilation enthusiasm and satisfaction i could strangle all those rich folks
all those rich folks
these men who pretend to be charitable who put on aids who go to mass who make presents to the priesthood preachy preachy in their skull caps and who think themselves above us and who come for the purpose of humiliating us and to bring us' clothes' as they say
old dude that are not worth four sous
and bread
that's not what i want pack of rascals that they are it's money
ah
money
never
because they say that we would go off and drink it up and that we are drunkards and idlers
and they
what are they then and what have they been in their time
thieves
they never could have become rich otherwise
oh
society ought to be grasped by the four corners of the cloth and tossed into the air will fit
it would all be smashed very likely but at least no one would have anything and there would be that much gained
but what is that blockhead of a benevolent gentleman doing
will become
perhaps the animal has forgotten the address
i'll bet that that old beast at that moment there came a light tap at the door them and usher foot and opened it exclaiming amid profound bows and smiles of adoration enters or
deign to enter most respected benefactor and your charming young lady also
a man of ripe age and a young girl made their appearance on the threshold of the attic
marius had not quitted his post
his feelings for the moment surpassed the powers of the human tongue
it was she
whoever has loved knows all the radiant meanings contained in those three letters of that word she
it was certainly she
marius could hardly distinguish her through the luminous vapor which had suddenly spread before his eyes
it was that sweet absent being that star which had beamed upon him for six months it was those eyes that he is that mouth that lovely vanished face which had created night by its departure
the vision had been eclipsed now it reappeared
it reappeared in that gloom in that garret in that misshapen attic in all that horror
marius shuddered in dismay
what
it was she
the palpitations of his heart troubled his sight
he felt that he was on the brink of bursting into tears
what
he beheld her again at last after having sought her so long
it seemed to him that he had lost his soul and that he had just found it again
she was the same as ever only a little pale her delicate face was framed in a bonnet of violet velvet her figure was concealed beneath spells self black satin
beneath her long dress a glimpse could be caught of her tiny foot show in a silken boot
she was still accompanied by m
leblanc
she had taken a few steps into the room and has deposited a tolerably bulky parcel on the table
the eldest jon dee the girl had retired behind the door and was at a ring with a ombre eyes at that velvet bonnet that will mantle and that charming happy face
chapter ix jon dee the comes near seeking the novel was so dark that people coming from without rely on entering it the effect produced on entering a cellar
the two newcomers advanced therefore with a certain hesitation being hardly able to dustin huish the vague forms surrounding them while they could be clearly seen and scrutinized by the eyes of the inhabitants of the target who were accustomed to this twilight
m
leblanc approached with his sad but kindly look and said to no need the the father monsieur in this package you will find some new clothes and some woollen stockings and blankets
our angelic benefactor overwhelms is said jon dee the bowing to the very earth
then bending down to the war of his eldest daughter while the two visitors were engaged in examining this lamentable interior he added in a low and rapid voice hey
what did i say
duds
no money
they are all alike
by the way how was the letter to that old blockhead signed
fagan you replied the girl
the dramatic artist good
it was lucky for non frette that this has occurred to him for at the very moment m

monsieur fagan routes that is it
i remember
dramatic artists it and one who has had some success
here jon dee the evidently judged the moment propitious for capturing the philanthropist
he exclaimed with an accent which smacked at the same time of the vainglory of the mounts bank affairs and the humility of the mendicant on the highway a pupil of talk a
sif
i am a pupil of talks
fortune formerly smiled on meal az
now it is misfortune's turn
you see my benefactor no bread no fire

leblanc
my child wounded
added jon dee the
the child diverted by the arrival of the strangers had fallen to contemplating the young lady and had ceased to sob
cry
bawl
said jon frette to her in a low voice
at the same time he punched her sore hand
all this was done with the talent of a juggler
the little girl gave vent to loud shrieks
the adorable young girl whom marius in his heart called his urdu is approached her hastily
poor dear child
said she
you see my beautiful young lady pursued uk here h feher bleeding wrist
it came through an accident while working at a machine to earn six sousa day
it may be necessary to cut off her arm
really
said the old gentleman in alarm
the little girl taking this seriously fell to sobbing more violently that ever
alas
yes my benefactor
replied the father
for several minutes monde et he had been scrutinizing the benefactor in a singular fashion
as he spoke he seemed to be examining the other attentively as though seeking to summon up his recollections
all at once profiting by a moment when the newcomers were questioning the child with interest as to her injured band he passed near his wife who lay in her bed with a stupid and dejected air and said to her in a rapid but very low tone take a look at that man
then turning tom
leblanc and continuing his lamentations you see air
all the clothing that i have is my wife's chemise
and all torn at that
in the depths of winter
ican't go out for lack of a coat

there air
i owe for four quarters a whole year
that is to say slaty france
jon dee the lied
four quarters would have amounted to only forty france and he could not owe four because six months had not elapsed since marius had paid for two
m
leblanc drew five france from his pocket and threw them on the table
jon dee the found time to mutter in the war of his eldest daughter the scoundrel
what does he think i can do with his five france
thatwon't lay me for my chair and land of glass
that's what comes of incurring expenses
in the meanwhile m
leblanc had removed the large brown great do at which he wore over his blue coat and had thrown it over the back of the chair
monsieur fagan you he said these five brands are all that i have about me but i shall now take my daughter home and i will return this evening it is this evening that you must pay is it not
jpn frette's face lighted up with a strange expression
he replied vivaciously yes respected sur
at eighto'clock i must be at my landlord's
i will be here at six and i will fetch you the sixty france
my benefactor
exclaimed jobs retreive get elmer
and he added in a low tone take a good look at him wife
m
leblanc had taken the arm of the young girl once more and had turned towards the door
farewell until this evening my friends
said he
sixo'clock
said jon dee the
sixo'clock precisely
at that moment the overcoat lying on the chair caught the eye of the elder home're the girl
you are forgetting your coatsie said she
jon dee the darted an annihilating look at his daughter accompanied by a formidable shrug of the shoulders
m
leblanc turned back and said with a smile i have not forgotten it i am leaving it
o my protector
said jon dee the my august benefactor i melt into tears
permit me to accompany you to your carriage
if you come out answered m
leblanc put on this coat
it really is very cold
i ondrej he did not need to be told twice
he hastily donned the brown great coat
and all three went out jon dee the preceding the two strangers
chapters tariff of licensed cabs two france any our marius had lost nothing of this entire scene and yet in reality had seen nothing
his eyes had remained fixed on the young girl his heart had so to speak seized her and wholly enveloped her from the moment of her very first step in that target
during her entire stay there he had lived that life of ecstasy which suspends material perceptions and precipitated the whole soul on a single point
he contemplated not that girl but that light which wore a satin of lisse and a velvet bonnet
the star sirius might have entered the room and he would not have been any more dazzled
while the young girl was engaged in opening the package unfolding the clothing and the blankets questioning the sick mother kindly and the little injured girl tenderly he watched her every movement he sought to catch her words
he knew her eyes her brow her beauty her form her walk he did not know the sound of her voice
he had once fancied that he had caught a few words at the luxembourg but he was not absolutely sure of the fact
he would have given ten years of his life to hear it in order that he might bear away in missoula little of that music
but everything was drowned in the lamentable exclamations and trumpet bursts of jon dee the
this added a touch of genuine wrath to marine' ecstasy
he devoured her with his eyes
he could not believe that it really was that divine creature whom he saw in the midst of those file creatures in that kind frou's lair
it seemed to him that he beheld a hummingbird in the midst of roads
when she took her departure he had but one thought to follow her to cling to her trace not to quit her until he learned where she lived not to lose her again at least after having so miraculously be discovered her
he leaped down from the commode and seized his hat
as he laid his hand on the lock of the door and was on the point of opening it a sudden reflection caused him to pause
the corridor was long the staircase steep none yet he was talkative m
leblanc had no doubt not yet regained his carriage if in turning round in the corridor or on the staircase he were to catch sight of him marius in that house he would evidently take the alarm and find means to escape from him again and this time it would be final
what was metodo
should be wait a little
but while he was waiting the carriage might drive off
marius was perplexed
atlas the accepted the risk and quitted his room
there was no one in the corridor
he hastened to the stairs
there was no one on the staircase
he descended in all haste and reached the boulevard in time to see aflac returning the corner of the rue du petit ban quiet on its way back to paris
marius rushed headlong in that direction
on arriving at the angle of the boulevard he caught sight of the fische again rapidly descending the rush out retard the carriage was already a long way off and there was no means of overtaking it what
run after it
impossible and besides the people in the carriage would assuredly not ocean individual running at full speed in pursuit of ago acre and the father would recognize him
at that moment wonderful and unprecedented good luck marius perceived an empty can passing along the boulevard
there was but one thing to be done to jump into this can and follow the discre
that was sure efficacious and free from danger
marius made the drivers sign to halt and called to him by the hour
marius wore no cravat he had on his working coat which was destitute of buttons his shirt was torn along one of the plaits on the bosom
the driver halted winked and held out his left hand to marius rubbing his forefinger gently with his thumb
what is it
said marius
pay in advance said the coachman
marius recollected that he had but sixteen sous about him
how much
he demanded
for the ous
i will pay on my return
the driver's only reply was to whistle the air of papal uses and to whip up his horse
marius stared at the retreating cabriolet with a bewildered air
for the lack of four and twenty douche was losing his joy his happiness his love
he had seen and he was becoming blind again
he reflected bitterly and it must be confessed with profound regret on the five francs which he had bestowed that very morning in that miserable girl
if he had had those five franc she would have been saved he would have been born again he would have emerged from the limbo and darkness he would have made his escape from isolation and spleen from his widowed state he might have're knotted the black thread of his destiny to that beautiful golden thread which had just floated before his eyes and had broken at the same instant once more
he returned to his novel in despair
he might have told himself that m
leblanc had promised to return in the evening and that all he had to do was to set about the matter more skilfully so that he might follow him in that occasion but in his contemplation it is doubtful whether he had heard this
as he was on the point of mounting the staircase he perceived in the other side of the boulevard near the deserted walk skirting the rue de la barriers des gobelins jon dee the wrapped in the philanthropist's great coat engaged in conversation with one of those men of disquieting aspect who have been dubbed by common consent prowlers of the barriers people of equivocal face of suspicious monologues who present the air of having evil minds and who generally sleep in the daytime which suggests the supposition that they work by night
these two men standing there motionless and in conversation in the snow which was falling in whirlwinds formed a group that a policeman would surely have observed but which marius hardly noticed
still in spite of his mournful preoccupation he could not refrain from saying to himself that this prowler of the barriers with whom jones et he was talking resembled a certain pan chau dallas printable dallas big ten all of whom source trac had once pointed out to him as a very dangerous nocturnal roamer
this man's name the reader has learned in the preceding book
this pancha us alias printable rail as big demaille figured later on in many criminal trials and became a notorious rascal
he was at that time only a famous rascal
today he exists in the state of tradition among ruffians and assassins
he was at the head of a school towards the end of the last reign
and in the evening at nightfall at the hour when groups form and talk in whispers he was discussed at la force in the eos sexual ions
one might even in that prison precisely at the spot where the sewer which served the unprecedented escape in broad daylight of thirty prisoners in passes under the culvert read his name pan chair audaciously carved by his own hand on the wall of the sewer during one of his attempts at flight
in the police already had their eye on him but he had not as yet made a serious beginning
chapter xi offers of service from misery to wretchedness marius ascended the stairs of the novel with slow steps at the moment when he was about to reenter his cell he caught sight of the elder jon dee the girl following him through the corridor
the very sight of this girl was odious to him it was she who had his five francs it was too late to demand them back the cab was no longer there the cia crew as far away
moreover she would not have given them back
as for questioning her about the residence of the persons who had just been there that was useless it was evident that she did not know since the letter signed fagan you had been addressed to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques du haut pas
marius entered his room and pushed the door to after him
it did not close he turned round and beheld a hand which held the door half open
what is it
he asked who is there
it was the jon dee the girl
is if you
resumes marius almost harshly still you
what do you want with me
she appeared to be thoughtful and did not look at him
she no longer had the air of assurance which had chat acterized her that morning
she did not enter but held back in the darkness of the corridor where marius could see her through the half open door
come now will you answer
cried marius
what do you want with me
she raised her full eyes in which a sort of gleam seemed to flicker vaguely and said monsieur marius you look sad
what is the matter with you
with me
said marika
yes you
there is nothing the matter with me
yes there is
no
i tell you there is
let me alone
marius gave the door another push but she regained her hold on it
stop said she you are in the wrong
although you are not rich you were kind this morning
be so again now
you gave me something to eat now tell me what ails you
you are grieved that is plain
i do not want you to be grieved
what can be done for it
canine of any service
employme
i do not ask for your secrets you need not tell them to me but i may be of use nevertheless
i may be able to help you since i help my father
when it is necessary to carry letters to go to houses to inquire from door to door to find out an address to follow any one i am of service
well you may assuredly tell me what is the matter with you and i will go and speak to the persons sometimes it is enough if someone speaks to the persons that suffices to let them understand matters and everything comes right
make use of me
an idea flashed across marius' mind
what branch does one disdain when one feels that one is falling
he drew near to the jon dee the girl
listen he said to her
she interrupted him with a gleam of joy in her eyes
oh yes do call me thou
i like that better
well he resumed thou hast brought higher that old gentleman and his daughter
yes
dost thou know their address
no
find it for me
the job frette's full eyes had grown joyous and they now became gloomy
is that what you want
she demanded
yes
do you know them
no
that is to say she resumed quickly you do not know use but you wish to know yet
this them which had turned into her had something indescribably significant and bitter about it
we'll can you do it
said marius
you shall have the beautiful lady's address
there was still a shade in the words the beautiful lady which troubled marius
he resumed never mind after all the address of the father and daughter
their address indeed
she gazed fixedly at him
what will you give me
anything you like
anything i like
yes
you shall have the address
she dropped her head then with a brusque move meng she pulled to the door which closed behind her
marius found himself alone
he dropped into a chair with his head and both elbows on his bed absorbed in thoughts which he could not grasp and as though a prey to vertigo
all that had taken place since the morning the appearance of the angel her disappearance what that creature had just said to him a gleam of hope floating in an immense despair this was what filled his brain confusedly
all at once he was violently aroused from his're very
he heard the shrill hard voice of monde et de utter these words which were fraught with a strange interest for him i tell you that i am sure of it and that i recognized him
of whom was kind tette speaking
whom had he recognized
m
leblanc
the father of his je suis
what
dition frette know him
was marius about to obtain in this abrupt and unexpected fashion all the information without which his life was so dark to him
waste about to learn at last who it was that he loved who that young girl was
who her father was
was the dense shadow which en wrapped them in the point of being dispelled
was the veil about to be rent
ah
heavens
he founded rather than climbed up on his commode and resumed his post near the little peep hole in the partition wall
again he beheld the interior of jon dee the' shovel
chapter xii the use made of m
leblanc's five francois de nothing in the aspect of the family was altered except that the wife and daughters had levied on the package and put on woollen stockings and jackets
two new blankets were thrown across the two beds
jon dee the had evidently just returned
he still had the breathlessness of out of doors
his daughters were seated on the floor near the fireplace the elder engaged in dressing the younger's wounded hand
his wife had sunk back on the bed near the fireplace with a face indicative of astonishment
monde et de was pacing up and down the target with long strides
his eyes were extraordinary
the woman who seemed timid and overwhelmed with stupor in the presence of her husband turned to say what really
you are sure
sure
eight years have passed
but i recognize him
ah
i recognize him
i knew him at once
what
didn'ti t force itself on you
no
but i told you' pay attention
' why it is his figure it is his face only older there are people who do not grow old idon't know how they manage it it is the very sound of his voice
he is better dressed that is all
ah
you mysterious old devil i've got you that i have
he paused and said to his daughters get out of here you
it's queer that it didn't strike you
they arose to obey
the mother stammered with her injured hand
the air will do it good said jon dee the
geoff
it was plain that this man was of the sort to whom no one of fees to reply
the two girls departed
at the moment when they were about to pass through the door the father detained the elder by the arm and said to her with a peculiar accent you will be here at fiveo'clock precisely
both of you
i shall need you
marius redoubled his attention
on being left alone with his wife monde et he began to pave the room again and made the tour of it two or three times in silence
then he spent several minutes in tucking the lower part of the woman's chemise which he wore into his trousers
all at once he turned to the female jon dee the folded his arms and exclaimed and would you like to gave me tell you something
the young lady well what
retorted his wife the young lady
marius could not doubt that it was really age of whom they were speaking
he listened with ardent anxiety
his whole life was in his ears
but monde et he had bent over and spoke to his wife in a whisper
then he straightened himself up and concluded aloud it issue
that one
said his wife
that very one said the husband
no expression can reproduce the significance of the mother's words
surprised are here wrath were mingled and combined in one monstrous intonation
the pronunciation of a few words the name no doubt which her husband had whispered in her ear had sufficed to rouse this huge somnolent woman and from being repulsive she became terrible
it is not possible
she cried
when i think that my daughters are going barefoot and have not shown to their backs
what
a satin or losses velvet bonnet boots and everything more than two hundred francs' worth of clothes
so that one would think she was a lady
no you are mistaken
why in the first place the other was hideous and this one is not so bad looking
she really is not bad looking
it can' the sme
i tell you that it issue
you will see
at this absolute assertion the jon dee the woman raised her large red blonde face and stared at the ceiling with a horrible expression
at that moment she seemed to marius even more to be feared than her husband
she was a cow with the look of a tigress
what
she resumed that horrible beautiful young lady who taxed at my daughters with an air of pity she is that beggar brat
oh
i should like to kick her stomach informer
she sprang off of the bed and remained standing for a moment her hair in disorder her nostrils dilating her mouth half open her fists clenched and drawn back
then she fell back on the bed once more
the man paced to and fro and paid no attention to his female
after a silence lasting several minutes he approached the female jon frette and halted in front of her with folded arms as he had done a moment before and shall i tell you another thing
what is it
she asked
he answered in a low curt voice my fortune is made
the woman stared at him with the look that signifies is the person who is addressing me on the point of going mad
he went on thunder
it was not so very long ago that i was a parishioner of the parish of rid of number of you have a fire die of cold if you have bread
i have had enough of misery
my share and other people's share
i am not joking any longer idon't find it comic anymore i've had enough of puns good god
no more fat ass eternal father
i want to eat till i am till i want to drink my bill
to gorman size
to sleep
to do nothing
i want to have my turn so i do come now
before i die
i want to be a bit of a million naire
he took a turn round the novel and added like other people
what do you mean by that
asked the woman
he shook his head winked screwed up one eye and raised his voice like a medical professor who is about to make a demonstration what do i mean by that
listen
bush
muttered the woman not so loud
these are matters which must not be overheard
bah
who's here
our neighbor
i saw him go out a little while ago
besides hedoesn't listen the big boob y
and i tell you that i saw him go out
nevertheless by a sort of instinct jon dee the lowered his voice although not sufficiently to prevent marius hearing his words
one favorable circumstance which enabled marine not to lose a word of this conversation was the falling snow which deadened the sound of vehicles on the boulevard
this is what marius heart listen carefully
the croesus is caught or as good as caught
that's all settled already
everything is arranged
i have seen some people
he will come here this evening at sixo'clock
to bring sixty francs the rascal
did you notice how i played that game on him my sixty france my landlord my fourth of february
idon't even lee for one quarter
isn't be a fool
so he will come at sixo'clock
that's the hour when our neighbor goes to his dinner
mother bouton is off washing dishes in the city
there's not a soul in the house
the neighbor never comes home until eleveno'clock
the children shall stand on watch
you shall help us
he will give in.
and what if he does not give in.
demanded his wife
mon frette made a sinister gesture and said we'll fix him
and he burst out laughing
this was the first time marius had seen him laugh
the laugh was cold and sweet and provoked a shudder
jon dee the opened a cupboard near the fireplace and drew from its gold cap which he placed on his head after brushing it with his sleeve
now said he i'm going out
i have some more people that i must see
good ones
you'll see how well the whole thing will work
i shall be a way as short a time as possible it's a fine stroke of business do you look after the house
and with both fists thrust into the pockets of his trousers he stood for a moment in thought they exclaimed do you know it's mighty lucky by the way that he didn't recognize me
if he had recognized me on his side he would not have come back again
he would have slipped through our fingers
it was my beard that saved us
my romantic beard
my pretty little romantic beard
and again he broke into a laugh
he stepped to the window
the snow was still falling and streaking the gray of the sky
what beastly weather
said he
then lapping his overcoat across his breast this fund is too large for me
nevermind he added he did a devilish good thing in leaving it for me the old scoundrel
if ithavn't been for that icouldn't have gone out and everything would have gone wrong
what shall points things hang on any way
and pulling his cap down over his eyes he quitted the room
he had barely had time to take half a dozen steps from the door when the door opened again and his savage but intelligent face made its appearance once more in the opening
i came near forgetting said he
you are to have a brazier of charcoal ready
and he flung into his wife's apron the five franc piece which the philanthropist had left with him
a brazier of charcoal
asked his wife
yes
how many bushels
two good ones
that will come to thirty sous
with the rest i will buy something for dinner
the devil no
why
din't go and spend the hundreds ou piece
why
because i shall have to buy something you
what
something
how much shall you need
where abouts in the neighborhood is there an ironmonger's shop
the mou v retard
ah
ye say the corner of a street i can see the shop
but tell me how much you will need for what you have to purchase
fifth skus three france
therewon't be much left for dinner
eating is not the point today
there's something better to be done
that's enough my jewel
at this word from his wife jon dee the closed the door again and this time marius heard his step did away in the corridor of the novel and descend the staircase rapidly
at that moment oneo'clock struck from the church of saint medard
chapter xiii solus cum solo un poco de moto non do not anunturi rare paternoster marine dreamer acres as was as we have said firm and energetic by nature
his habits of solitary meditation while they had developed in him sympathy and compassion had perhaps diminished the faculty for irrigation but had left intact the power of waxing indignant he had the kindliness of a brahmin and the severity of a judge he took pity upon a road but he crushed a viper
now it was into a hole of vipers that his glance had just been directed it was anger of monsters that he had beneath his eyes
these wretches must be stamped upon said he
not one of the enigmas which he had hoped to see solved had been elucidated in the contrary all of them had been rendered more sense if anything he knew nothing more about the beautiful maiden of the luxembourg and the man whom he called m
leblanc except that kind ref he was acquainted with them
athwart the mysterious words which had been uttered the only thing of which he caught a distinct glimpse was the fact that an ambush was in course of preparation a dark but terrible trap that both of them were incurring great danger she probably her father certainly that they must be saved that the hideous plots of the job fretted must be thwarted and the web of these spiders broken
he scanned the female jon frette for a moment
she had pulled an old sheet iron stove from a corner and she was rummaging among the old heap of iron
he descended from the commode as softly as possible taking care not to make the least noise
amid his terror as to what was in preparation and in the horror with which the job fretted had inspired him he experienced a sort of joy at the idea that it might be granted to him perhaps to render a service to the one whom he loved
but how was it to be done
how warn the person's threatened
he did not know their address
they had reappeared for an instant before his eyes and had then plunged back again into the immense depths of paris
should be wait form
leblanc at the door that evening at sixo'clock at the moment of his arrival and warn him of the trap
but none regge and his men would see him on the watch the spot was lonely they were stronger than me they would device means to seize him or to get him away and the man whom marius was anxious to save would be lost
oneo'clock had just struck the trap was to be sprung at six
marius had five hours before him
there was but one thing to be done
he put on his recent coat knotted a silk handkerchief round his neck took his hat and went out without making any more noise than if he had been treading on moss with bare feet
moreover the jon dee the woman continued to rummage among her old iron
once outside of the house he made for the rue du petit ban quiet
he had almost reached the middle of this street near a very low wall which a man can easily step over at certain points and which abuts on a waste space and was walking slowly in consequence of his preoccupied condition and the snow deadened the sound of his steps all at once he heard voices talking very close by
he turned his head the street was deserted there was not a soul i got it was broad daylight and be the distinctly heard voices
it occurred to him to glance over the wall which he was skirting
there in fact sat two men flat on the snow with their backs against the wall talking together in subdued tones
these two persons were strangers to him one was a bearded man in a blouse and the other a long haired individual in rags
the bearded man had on a fez the other's head was bare and the snow had lodged in to chair
by thrusting his head over the wall marius could hear their remarks
the hairy one hugged the other man's elbow and said with the assistance of patron minette it can' trail
do you think so
said the bearded man
and the long haired one began againit'sa a good as a warrant for each one of five hundred balls and the worst that can happen is five years six years ten years at the most
the other replied with some hesitation and shivering beneath his fez that's a real thing
youcan't go against such things
i tell you that the affaircan't go wrong resumed the long haired man
father what's his name's team will be already harnessed
then they began to discuss a melodrama that they had seen on the preceding evening at the gauge theatre
marius went his way
it seemed to him that the mysterious words of these men so strangely hidden behind that wall and crouching in the snow could not but bear some relation to monde et he's abominable projects
that must be the affair
he directed his course towards the faubourg saint marceau and asked at the first stop he came to where he could find a commissary of police
he was directed to rue de pontoise no
thither marius betook himself
as he passed a baker's shop he bought a two penny roll and ate it foreseeing that he should not done
on the way he rendered justice to providence
he reflected that had he not given his five france to the jon dee the girl on the morning he would have followed m
leblanc's fi acre and consequently have remained ignorant of everything and that there would have been no obstacle to the trap of the job fretted and that m
leblanc would have been lost and his daughter with him no doubt
chapter xiv in which a police agent bestows two fistful's on a lawyer on arriving at no
suede pontoise he ascended to the first floor and inquired for the commissary of police
the commissary of police is not here said a clerk but there is an inspector who takes his place
would you like to speak to him
are you in haste
yes said marius
the clerk introduced him into the commissary's office
there stood at all man behind a beating leaning against a stove and holding up with both hands the tails of a vast top coat with three dollars
his face was square with a thin firm mouth thick gray and very ferocious whiskers and a look that was enough to turn your pockets inside out
of that glance it might have been well said not that it penetrated but that it searches
this man's air was not much less ferocious not less terrible than non frette's the dog is at times no less terrible to meet than the wolf
what do you want
he said to marius without adding monsieur
is this monsieur le commissaire de police
he is absent
i am here in his stead
the matter is very private
then speak
and great taste is required
then speak quick
this calm abrupt man was both terrifying and reassuring at one and the same time
he inspired fear and confidence
marius related the adventure to him that a person with whom he was not acquainted otherwise than by sight was to being so goes into strap that very evening that as he occupied the room adjoining the venue marius pont mercy a lawyer had heard the whole plot through the partition that the wretch who had planned the trap was a certain non frette that there would be accomplices probably some prowlers of the barriers among others a certain pan chau dallas print an ideal is a big demaille that job frette's daughters were to lie in wait that there was no way of warning the threatened man since he did not even know his name and that finally all this was to be carried out at sixo'clock that evening at the most deserted point of the boulevard del' hopital in to use no
at the sound of this number the inspector raised his head and said coldly so it is in the room at the end of the corridor
precisely answered marius and he added are you acquainted with that house
the inspector remained silent for a moment then replied as he warned the heel of his boot at the door of the stove apparently
he went on muttering between his teeth and not addressing marius so much as his cravat patron minette must have had a hand in this
this words truck marius
patron minette said he i did hear that word pronounced in fact
and he repeated to the inspector the dialogue between the long haired man and the bearded man in the snow behind the wall of the rue du petit ban quite
the inspector muttered the long haired man must be bruno b and the bear defined emilia realize deux milliards
he had dropped his eyelids again and became absorbed in thought
as for father what's his name i think i recognize him
here i've burned my coat
they always have too much fire in these cursed stoves
number
former property of god beau
then he glanced at marina
you saw only that bearded and that long haired man
and pam chair
you didn't see a little imp of a candy prowling about the premises
no
nor a big lump of matter resembling an elephant in the jardin des plantes
no
nora's camp with the air of an old red tail
no
as for the fourth no one sees him not even his adjutant's clerks and employees
it is not surprising that you did not see him
no
who are all those persons
asked marius
the inspector answered besides this is not the time for them
he relapsed into silence then resumed
i know that barrack
i'm possible to conceal ourselves inside it without the artists seeing us and then they will get off simply by count demanding the vaudeville
they are so modest
an audience embarrassed them
none of that none of that
i want to hear them sing and make them dance
this monologue concluded he turned to marius and demanded gazing at him intently the whole are you afraid
of what
said markus
of these men
no more than yourself
retorted marius rudely who had begun to notice that this police agent had not yet said monsieur to him
the inspector stated still more intently at marius and continued with sen gentoo us solemnity there you speak like a brave man and like an honest man
courage does not read crime and honesty does not fear authority
marius interrupted him that is well but what do you intend to do
the inspector contented himself with the remark the lodgers have pass keys with which to get in at night
you must have one
yes said marine
have you it about you
yes
give it to me said the inspector
marius took his key from his waistcoat pocket handed it to the inspector and added if you will take my advice you will come in force
the inspector cast on marius such a glance as voltaire might have bestowed on a provincial academician who had suggested a rhyme to him with one movement he plunged his hands which were enormous into the two immense pockets of his top coat and pulled out two small steel pistols of the sort called knock me downs
then he presented them to marius saying rapidly in a curt tone take these
go home
hide in your chamber so that you may be supposed to have gone out
they are loaded
each one carries two balls
you will keep watch there is a hole in the wall as you have informed me
these men will come
leave them to their own devices for a time
when you think matters have reached a crisis and that it is time to put a stop to them for each of
not too soon
the rest concerns me
a shot into the ceiling the air no matter where
above all things not too soon
wait until they begin to put their project into execution you are a lawyer you know the proper point
marius took the pistols and put them in the side pocket of his coat
that makes a lump that can be seen said the inspector
put them in your trousers pocket
marius hid the pistols in his trousers pockets
now pursued the inspector there is not a minute more to be lost by anyone
what time is it
half past two
seveno'clock is the hour
sixo'clock answered marius
i have plenty of time said the inspector but no more than enough
don't forget anything that i have said to you
bang
a pistol shot
resteasy said marius
and as marius laid his hand on the handle of the door on his way out the inspector called to him by the way if you have occasion for my services between now and then come or send here
you will ask for inspector javert
chapter xvi on frette makes his purchases a few moments later about threeo'clock source grace handed to be passing along the rush out retard in company with bosquet
the snow had redoubled in violence and filled the air
bossier was just saying to court eur as one would say to see all these snowflakes fall that there was a plague of white butterflies in heaven
all at once bosquet caught sight of marius coming up the street towards the barrier with a peculiar air
hold
said bosquet
there's marius
i saw him said source trac
don't let's speak to him
why
he is busy
with what
don't you see his air
what air
he has the air of a man who is following someone
that's true said bosquet
just see the eyes he is making
said source trac
but who the deuce is me following
some fine flower yvonne ted wench
he's in love
but observed bosquet idon't see any wench nor any flowery bonnet in the street
there's not a woman round
courts trac took a survey and exclaimed he's following a man
a man in fact wearing a gray cap and whose gray beard could be distinguished although they only saw his back was walking along about twenty paces in advance of marius
this man was dressed in a great coat which was perfectly new and too large for him and in a frightful pair of trousers all hanging in rags and black with mud
bossier burst out laughing
who is that man
us
retorted source trac he's a poet
posts are very fond of wearing the trousers of dealers in rabbit skins and the overcoats of leeds of france
let's see where marius will go said bosquet let's see where the man is going let's follow them hey
bosquet
exclaimed source grace able ormeaux
you are a prodigious brute
follow a man who is following another man indeed
they're traced their steps
marius had in fact seen jon dee the passing along the rush out retard and was spying on his proceedings
jon dee the walked straight ahead without a suspicion that he was already held by a glance
he quitted the rush out retard and marius saw him enter one of the most terrible novels in the rue track suse he remained there about a quarter of an hour then returned to the rue mph feet see
he halted at an ironmonger's shop which then stood at the corner of the rue pierre lombard and a few minutes later marius saw him emerge from the shop holding in his hand a huge cold chisel with a white wood handle which he concealed beneath his great coat
at the top of the rue petit gentilly he turned to the left and proceeded rapidly to the rue du petit ban quiet
the day was declining the snow which had ceased for a moment had just begun again
marius posted himself on the watch at the very corner of the rue du petit ban quiet which was deserted as usual and did not follow jon frette into it
it was lucky that he did so for on arriving in the vicinity of the wall where marius had heard the long haired man and the bearded man conversing ion frette turned round made sure that no one was following him did not see him then sprang across the wall and disappeared
the wasteland bordered by this wall communicated with the backyard of an ex livery stable keeper of bad repute who had failed and who still kept a few old single seater berlin's under his sheds
marius thought that it would be wise to profit by jon frette's absence to return home moreover it was growing late every eveningma'am both on when she set out for her dishwashing in town had a habit of locking the door which was always closed at dusk
marius had given his key to the inspector of police lt. was important therefore that he should make haste
evening had arrived night had almost closed in on the horizon and in the immensity of space there remained but one spot illuminated by the sun and that was the moon
it was rising in a ruddy glow behind the low some of wallet ridge
marius returned to no
with great strides
the door was still open when he arrived
he mounted the stairs on tiptoe and glided along the wall of the corridor to his chamber
this corridor as the reader will remember was bordered on both sides by antics all of which were for the moment empty and to let
ma'am bouton was in the habit of leaving all the doors open
as he passed one of these attics marius though the perceived in the uninhabited sell the motionless heads of four men vaguely lighted up by a remnant of daylight falling through a dormer window
marius made no attempt to see not wishing to be seen himself
he succeeded in reaching his chamber without being seen and without making any noise
it was high time
a moment later he heardma'am bouton take her departure locking the door of the house behind her
chapter xvi in which will be found the words to an english air which was in fashion in marius seated himself on his bed
it might have been half past fiveo'clock
only half an hour separated him from what was about to happen
he heard then saving of his arteries as one hears the ticking of a watch in the dark
he thought of the double march which was going on at that moment in the dark crime advancing on one side justice coming up on the other
he was not afraid but he could not think without a shudder of what was about to take place
asks the case with all those who are suddenly assailed by an unforeseen adventure the entire day produced upon him the effect of a dream and in order to persuade himself that he was not the prey of a nightmare he had to feel the cold barrels of the steel pistols in his trousers pockets
it was no longer showing the moon disengaged itself more and more clearly from the mist and its light mingled with the white reflection of the snow which had fallen communicated to the chamber a sort of twilight aspect
there was a light in the job fretted en
marius saw the hole in the wall shining with a reddish glow which seemed bloody to mum
it was true that the light could not be produced by a candle
however there was not a sound in the jon dee the quarters not a soul was moving there not a soul speaking not a breath the silence was glacial and profound and had it not been for that light he might have thought himself next door to a sepulchre
marius softly removed his boots and pushed them under his bed
several minutes elapsed
marius heard the lower door turn on its hinges a heavy step mounted the staircase and hastened along the corridor the latch of the novel was noisily lifted it was jon dee the returning
instantly several voices arose
the whole family was in the garret
only it had been silent in the master's absence like wolfe helps in the absence of the wolf
it's i said he
good evening daddy helped the girls
well
said the mother
all's going first rate responded jon frette but my feet are beastly cold
good
you have dressed up
you have done well
you must inspire confidence
all ready to go out
don't forget what i told you
you will do everything sure
resteasy
because said jon dee the
and he left the phrase unfinished
marius heard him lay something heavy on the table probably the chisel which he had purchased
by the way said jon frette have you been eating here
yes said the mother
i got three large potatoes and some salt
i took advantage of the fire to cook them
good returned jon dee the
tomorrow i will take you out to dine with me
we will have a duck and fixings
you shall done like charles the tenth all is going well
then he added the mouse trap is open
the cats are there
he lowered his voice still further and said put this in the fire
markus heard a sound of charcoal being knocked with the rings or some iron utensil and jon dee the continued have you greased the hinges of the door so that they will not squeak
yes replied the mother
what time is it
nearly six
the half hour struck from saint med area while ago
the devil
ejaculated monde et're the children must go and watch
come you do you listen here
a whispering ensued
jon frette's voice became audible again has old bouton left
yes said the mother
are you sure that there is no one in our neighbor's room
he has not been in all day and you know very well that this is his dinner hour
you are sure
sure
all the same said jon frette there's no harm in going to see whether he is there
jeremy girl take the candle and got here
marius fell on his hands and knees and crawled silently under his bed
hardly had he concealed himself when he perceived a light through the crack of his door
l' pa cried a voice he is not in here
he recognized the voice of the eldest daughter
did you goin
demanded her father
no replied the girl but as his key is in the door he must be out
the father exclaimed go in nevertheless
the door opened and marius saw the tall no need the come in with a candle in her hand
she was as she had been in the morning only still more repulsive in this light
she walked straight up to the bed
marius endured an indescribable moment of anxiety but near the bed there was a mirror nailed to the wall and it was thither that she was directing her steps
she raised herself on tiptoe and looked at herself in it
in the neighboring room the sound of iron articles being moved was audible
she smoothed her hair with the palm other hand and smiled into the mirror humming with her cracked and sepulchral voice no sam our song sure route une semaine mais que du bonheur les instant saint courts
s' adored by it hours c' etait bien la peine
le temps des a hours devait durer toujours
devrait fired toujours
devrait durer toujours
in the meantime marius trembled
it seemed impossible to him that she should not hear his breathing
she stepped to the window and looked out with the half foolish way she had
how ugly paris is when it had put on a white chemise
said she
she returned to the mirror and began again to put on aids before it scrutinizing herself full face and three quarters face in turn
well
dried her father what are you about there
i am looking under the bed and the furniture she replied continuing to arrange her hair there's no one here
booby
yelled her father
come here this minute
anddon't waste any time about it
coming
coming
said she
one has no time for anything in this novel
she hummer vous ne quitted pour all et al ar loire mon triste coeur shifra partout
she cast a parting glance in the mirror and went out shutting the door behind her
a moment more and marius heard the sound of the two young girls' bare feet in the corridor and non frette's voice shouting to them pay strict here
one on the side of the barrier the other at the corner of the rue du petit ban quiet
don't lose sight for a moment of the door of this house and the moment you see anything rush here on the instant
as hard as you can go
you have a key to get in
the eldest girl grumbled the idea of standing watch in the show barefoot
tomorrow you shall have some dainty little green silk boots
said the father
they ran downstairs and a few seconds later the shock of the outer door as it banged to announced that they were outside
there now remained in the house only marius the job fretted and probably also the mysterious persons of whom marius had caught a glimpse in the twilight behind the door of the unused attic
chapter xvii the use made of marius' five franc piece marius decides that the moment had now arrived when he must resume his post at his observatory
in a twinkling and with the ability of his age he had reached the hole in the party tion
he looked
the interior of the jon dee the apartment presented a curious aspect and marius found an explanation of the singular light which he had noticed
a candle was burning in a candlestick covered with verdigris but that was not what really lighted the chamber
the novel was completely illuminated as it were by the reflection from a rather large sheet iron brazier standing in the fireplace and filled with burning charcoal the brazier prepared by the jon dee the woman that morning
the charcoal was blowing hot and the brazier wasted a blue flame flickered over it and helped him to make out the form of the chisel purchased by jon d. tette in the rue pierre lombard where it had been thrust into the brazier to heat
i'm one corner near the door and as though prepared for some definite use two meals were visible which appeared to be the one a heap of old iron the others heap of ropes
all this would have caused the kind of a person who knew nothing of what was in preparation to waver between a very sinister and a very simple idea
the lair thus lighted up more resembled a forge than a mouth of hell but kind dette in this light had rather the air of a demon than of a smith
the heat of the brazier was so great that the candle on the table was melting on the side near the chafing dish and was drooling over
an old dark lantern of copper worthy of diogenes turned cartouche stood on the chimney piece
the brazier placed in the fireplace itself beside the nearly extinct brands sent it's vapors up the chimney and gave out good or
the moon entering through the four pages of the window cast its whiteness into the crimson and flaming garden and to the poetic spirit of marius who was dreamy even in the moment of action it was like a thought of heaven mingled with the misshapen reveries of earth
a breath of air which made its way in through the open page helped to dissipate the smell of the charcoal and to conceal the presence of the brazier
the jon dee the lake was of the reader recalls what we have said of the gorge au building admirably chosen to serve as the theatre of a violent and sombre deed and as the envelope for a crime
it was the most retired chamber in the most isolated house on the most deserted boulevard in paris
if the system or ambush and traps had not already existed they would have been invented there
the whole thickness of a house and a multi tude of uninhabited rooms separated this dsn from the boulevard and the only window that existed opened in wastelands enclosed with walls and palisades
jon dee the bad lighted his pipe seated himself on the seat less chair and was engaged in smoking
his wife was talking to him in a low tone
if marius had been source trac that is to say one of those men who laugh on every occasion in life he would have burst with laughter when his gaze fell on the jon dee the woman
she had on a black bonnet with plumes not unlike the hats of the heralds at arms at the coronation of charles x
an immense tartan shawl over her knitted petticoat and the man's shoes which her daughter had scorned in the morning
it was this toilette which had extracted from non frette the exclamation good
you have dressed up
you have done well
you must inspire confidence
as for jobs bette he had not taken off the new sheflug which was too large for him and which h.
leblanc had given him and his costume continued to present that contrast of cost and trousers which constituted the ideal of a poet in source urac's eyes
all at once jon dee the lifted up his voice by the way
now that i think of it
in this weather he will come in a carriage
light the lantern take it and go downstairs
you will stand behind the lower door
the very moment that you hear the carriage stop you will open the door instantly he will come up you will light the staircase and the corridor and when he enters here you will go downstairs again as speedily as possible you will pay the coachman and dismiss that i acre
and the money
inquired the woman
jon dee the fumbled in his trousers pocket and handed her five france
what's this
she rx claims d
jon dee the replied with dignity that is the monarch which our neighbor gave us this morning
and he added do you know what
two chairs will be needed here
what for
to sit on
marius felt a cold chill pass through his limbs at hearing this mild answer from jon dee the
par dieu
i'll go and get one of our neighbor's
and with a rapid movement she opened the door of the demand went out into the corridor
marius absolutely had not the time to descend from the commode reach his bed and conceal himself beneath it
take the candle cross jon dee the
no. said she it would embarrass me i have the two chairs to carry
there is moonlight
marius heard mother jones et he's heavy hand fumbling at his lock in the dark
the door opened
he remained nailed to the spot with the shock and with horror
the jon dee the entered
the dormer window permitted the entrance of a day of moonlight between two blocks of shadow
one of these blocks of shadow entirely covered the wall against which marius was leaning so that he disappeared within it
mother jon dee the raised her eyes did not see marius took the two chairs the only ones which marius possessed and went away letting the door fall heavily to behind her
where entered the lair
here are the two chairs
and here is the lantern
go down as quick as you can
she hastily obeyed and monde et he was left alone
he placed the two chairs on opposite sides of the table turned the chisel in the brazier set in front of the fireplace an old screen which masked the chafing dish then went to the corner where lay the pile of rope and bent down as though to examine something
marius then recognized the fact bnwt what he had taken for a shapeless mass was a very well made rope ladder with wooden rings and two hooks with which to attach it
this ladder and some large tools veritable masses of iron which were mingled with the old iron piled up behind the door had not been in the hon see the novel in the morning and had evidently been brought thither in the afternoon during marius' absence
those are the utensils of an edge tool maker thought marius
had markus been a little more learned in this line he would have recognized in what he took for the engines of a merge tool maker certain instruments which will force a lock or pick a lock and others which will cut or slice the two families of tools which burglars call cadets and faux hants
the fireplace and the two chairs were exactly opposite marius
the brazier being concealed the only light in the room was now furnished by the candle the smallest bit of crockery on the table or on the chimney piece cast a large shadow
there was something indescribably calm threatening and hideous about this chamber
one felt that there existed in it the anticipation of something terrible
jon dee the had allowed his pipe to go out a serious sign of preoccupation and had again seated himself
the candle brought out the fierce and the fine angles of his countenance
be indulged in scowls and in abrupt unfolding's of the right hand as though he were responding to the last counsels of a sombre inward monologue
on the course of one of these dark replies which he was making to himself he pulled the table drawer rapidly towards him took out along kitchen knife which was concealed there and tried the edge of its blade on his mail
that done be put the knife back in the drawer and shut it
marius on his side grasped the pistol in his right pocket drew it out and cocked or
the pistol emitted a sharp clear click ashe cock edit
jon frette started half rose listened a moment then began to laugh and said what a fool i am
it's the partition cracking
marius kept the pistol in his hand
chapter xviii marine' two chairs for mavis avis suddenly the distant and melancholy vibration of a clock shook the pages
sixo'clock was striking from saint medard
jon dee the marked off each step or with a toss of his head
when the sixth has struck he sniffed the candle with his fingers
then he began to pass up and down the room listened at the corridor walked on again then listened once more
provided only that becomes
he muttered then he returned to his chair
he had hardly re seated himself when the door opened
mother monde et he had opened it and now remained in the corridor making a horrible amiable grimace which one of the holes of the dark lantern illuminated from below
enters its he said
enter my benefactor repeated jon dee the rising hastily
m
leblanc made his appearance
he wore an air of serenity which rendered him singularly venerable
he laid four louis on the table
monsieur fagan you said he this is for your rent and your most pressing necessities
we will attend to the rest hereafter
may god require it to you my generous benefactor
said jon dee the
and rapidly approaching his wife dismiss the carriage
she slipped out while her husband was lavishing salutes and offering m
leblanc a chair
an instant later she returned and whispered in his ear' tis done
the snow which had not ceased falling since the morning was so week that the arrival of the disc re had not been audible and they did not now hear it's departure
meanwhile m
leblanc had seated himself
jon dee the had taken possession of the other chair facing m
leblanc
now in order to form an idea of the scene which is to follow let the reader picture to himself in his own mind a cold night the solitudes of the wallet ridge code red with snow and white as winding sheets in the moonlight the taper like lights of the street lanterns which shone feel there and there along those that is boulevards and the long rows of black elk's not a passerby for perhaps a quarter of a league around the gorge auto delay its highest pitch of silence of horror and of darkness in that building in the midst of those solitudes in the midst of that darkness the vast jon dee the garret lighted by a single candle and in that went women seated at a table m
leblanc tranquil jon dee the smiling and alarming the jon dee the woman the female wolf in one corner and behind the partition marius invisible erect not losing a word not kissing a single movement his eye on the watch and pistol in hand
however marius experienced only an emotion of horror but not far
he clasped the stock of the pistol firmly and felt reassured
i shall be able to stop that wretch whenever i please he thought
he felt that the police were there somewhere in an busca de waiting for the signal agreed upon and ready to stretch out their arm
moreover he was in hopes that this violent encounter between non frette and m
leblanc would cast some light on all the things which he was interested in learning
chapter six occupying one's self with obscure depths hardly wash
leblanc seated when he turned his eyes towards the pallets which were empty
how is the poor little wounded girl
he inquired
bad replied jon frette with a heartbroken and grateful smile very bad my worthy air
her elder sister has taken her to the bourne to have had hurt dresses
you will see them presently they will be back immediately
madame fagan you seems to me to be better went on m
leblanc casting his eyes on the eccentric costume of the montre the woman as she stood between him and the door as though already guarding the exit and gazed at him in an attitude of menace and almost of combat
she is dying said jon dee the
but what do you expect air
she has so much courage that woman has
she's not a woman she's a box
the hon dr byte touched by his compliment deprecated it with the affected air does flattered monster
you are always too good time monsieur yonder the
jon dee the
said m
leblanc i thought your name was fagan you
fagan you alias yonder the
replied the bush and hurriedly
an artistic sobriquet
and launching at his wife a shrug of the shoulders which m
leblanc did not catch he continued with an emphatic and caressing inflection of voice am
we have had a happy life together this poor darling and i
what would there be left for us if we had not that
we are so wretched my respectable air
we have arms but there is no work
we have the will no work
idon't know how the government arranged that but on my word of honor sir i am not jacobins if i am not a housing or
idon't wish the many evil but if i were the ministers in my most sacred word things would be different
here for instance i wanted to have my girls taught the trade of paper box makers
you will say to me' what
a trade
' yes
a trade
a simple trade
a breadwinner
what we all my benefactor
what a degradation when one has been what we have been
alas
there is nothing left to us of our days of prosperity
one thing only a picture of which i think a great deal but which i am willing to part with for i must live
item one must live
while non frette this talked with an apparent in coherence which detracted nothing from the thoughtful and sagacious eap session of his physiognomy marius raised his eyes and perceived at the other end of the room a person whom he had not seen before
a man had just entered so softly that the door had not been heard to turn on its hinges
this man wore a violet knitted feat which was old worn spotted cut and gaping at every bold wide trousers of cotton velvet wooden shoes on his feet no shirt had his neck bare his bare arms tattooed and his face smeared with black
he had seated himself in silence on the nearest bed and as he was behind yonder the he could only be in distinctly seen
that sort of magnetic instinct which turns aside the gaze caused m
leblanc to turn round almost at the same moment as marius
he could not refrain from a gesture of surprise which did not escape jon dee the
ah
i see
exclaimed jon dee the buttoning up his coat with an air ofcom plaisance you are looking at your overcoat
it fits me
my faith but it butane
who is that man
said m
leblanc
jim
ejaculated up here thehe'sa neighbor of mine
don't pay any attention to him
the neighbor was a singular looking individual
however manufactories of chemical products abound in the tambour r saint marceau
many of the workmen might have black faces
besides this m.
leblanc's whole person was expressive of candid and intrepid confidence
he went on excuse me what were you saying m
fagan you
i was telling you die and dear protector replied jon dee the placing his elbows on the table and contemp latin fm
leblanc with steady and tender eyes not unlike the eyes of the boa constrictor i was telling you that i have a picture to sell
a slight sound came from the door
a second man had just entered and seated himself on the bed behind jon dee the
like the first his arms were bare and he had a mask of ink or lamp black
although this man had literally glided into the room he had not been able to prevent m
leblanc catching sight of him
don't mind them said no need the they are people who belong in the noise
so i was saying that there remains in my possession a valuable picture
but stops or take a look at ut
heroes went to the wall at the foot of which stood the panel which we have already mentioned and turned it round still lead in not supported against the wall
it really was something which resembled a picture and which the candle illuminated somewhat
markus could make nothing out of it as jon dee the stood between the picture and homme only saw a coarse daub and a sort of principal personage colored with the harsh crudity of foreign canvasses and screen paintings
what is that
asked m
leblanc
yonder the exclaimed a painting by a master a picture of great value my benefactor
i am as much attached to it as i am to my two daughters it recalls souvenirs home
but i have told you and i will not take it back that i am so wretched that i will part with it
either by chance or because he had begun to feel a dawning uneasiness m
leblanc's glance returned to the bottom of the room as he examined the picture
there were now four men three seated on the be done standing near the door list all four with bare arms and motionless with faces smeared with black
one of those on the bed was leaning against the wall with closed eyes and it might have been supposed that he was asleep
he was old his white hair contrasting with his blackened face produced a horrible effect
the other two seemed to be young ones of safe and the other wore his hair long
none of them had on shoes those who did not wear socks were barefooted
jon dee the noticed that m
leblanc's eye was fixed on these men
they are friends
they are neighbors said he
their faces are black because they work in charcoal
they are chimney builders
don't trouble yourself about them mg benefactor but buy my picture
have pity on my misery
i will not ask you much for it
how much do you think it is worth
well said m
leblanc looking jon dee the full in the eye and with the manner of a man who is on his guard it is some signboard for a tavern and is worth about three france
jon dee the replies sweetly have you your pocketbook with you
i should be satisfied with a thousand crowns
m
leblanc sprang up placed his back against the wall and cast a rapid glance around the room
he had mon are the on his left on the sirens at the window and the yonder the woman and the four men on his right on the side near the door
the four men did not stir and did not even seem to be looking on
jon draft dna data in begun to speak in a plaintive tone with so vague an eye and so lamentable an intimation that m
leblanc might have supposed that what he had before him was a man who had simply gone mad with misery
if you do not buy my picture my dear benefactor said jon dee the i shall be left without resources there will be nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river
when i think that i wanted to have my two girls taught the middle class paper box trade the making of boxes for new year's gifts
well
a table with a board at the end to keep the glasses from falling off is required then a special stove is needed a lot with three compartments for the different degrees of strength of the paste according as it is to be used for wood paper or stuff a paring knife to cut the cardboard a mould to adjust its hammerton all the steels pincers how the devil do i know what all
and all that in order to earn four sousa day
and you have to work fourteen hours a day
and each box passes through the work woman's hands thirteen times
and you can'm set the paper
and you mustn't spot anything
and you must keep the past shot
the devil i tell you
four sousa day
how do you suppose a man is to live
as he spoke monde et he did not look at m
leblanc who was observing him
m
leblanc's eye was fixed on mon frette and non frette's eye was fixed in the door
marius' eager attention was transferred from one to the other
m
leblanc seemed to be asking himself is this man an idiot
jon dee the repeated two or three distinct times with all manner of varying inflections of the whining and supplies ring order there is nothing left for me but to throw myself into the river
i went down three steps at the side of the bridge of austerlitz the other day for that purpose
all at once his full eyes lighted up with a hideous flash the little man drew himself up and became terrible took a step toward m
leblanc and cried in a voice of thunder that has nothing to do with the question
do you know me
chapter xx the trap the door of the garret had just opened abruptly and allowed a view of three men clad in blue linen blouses and masked with masks of black paper
the first was thin and had a long iron tipped cudgel the second who was a sort of colossus carried by the middle of the handle with the blade downward a butcher's pole axe for slaughtering cattle
the third a man with thick set shoulders not so slender as the first held in his hand an enormous key stolen from the door of some prison
it appeared that the arrival of these men was what monde et he had been waiting for
a rapid dialogue ensued between him and the man with the cudgel the thin one
is everything ready
said jon dee the
yes replied the thin man
where is montparnasse
the young principal act or stopped to chat with your girl
which
the eldest
is there a carriage at the door
yes
is the team harnessed
yes
with two gold horses
excellent
i sites i find where i ordered
yes
good said jon dee the
m
leblanc was very pale
he was scrutinizing everything around him in the den like a man who understands what he has fallen into and his head directed in turn toward all the heads which surrounded him moved on his neck with an astonished and attentive slowness but there was nothing in his wit which resembled fear
he had improvised an in french ment out of the table and the man who but an instant previously has borne merely the appearance of a kindly old man had suddenly become a sort of athlete and placed his robust fist on the back of his chair with a formidable and surprising gesture
this old man who was so firm and so brave in the presence of such a danger seemed to possess one of those natures which areas courageous as they are kind both easily and simply
the father of a woman whom we love is never a stranger to us
marius felt proud of that unknown man
three of the men of whom monde et he had said they are chimney builders had armed themselves from the pile of old iron one with a heavy pair of shears the second with weighing tongs the third with a hammer and had placed themselves across the entrance without uttering a syllable
the old man had remained on the bed and had merely opened his eyes
the jon dee the woman had seated herself beside him
marius decided that in a few seconds more the moment for intervention would arrive and he raised his right hand towards the ceiling in the direction of the corridor in readiness to discharge his pistol
jon dee the having terminated his colloquy with the man with the cudgel turned once more tom
leblanc and repeated his question accompanying it with that low repressed and terrible laugh which was peculiar to him so you do not recognize me
m
leblanc looked him fill in the face and replies no
then jon dee the advanced to the table
he leaned across the candle crossing his arms putting his angular and ferocious jaw close to m
leblanc's calm face and advancing as far as possible without forcing m
leblanc to retreat and in this posture of a wild beast who is about to bite he exclaimed my name is not gahan you my name is not jon dee the my name is the barrier
i am the innkeeper of mont vermeil
do you understand
the barrier
how do you know me
an almost imperceptible flush crossed m
leblanc's grow and he replied with a voice which neither trembled not rose above its ordinary level with his accustomed pl acidity no more than before
marius did not hear this reply
anyone who had seen him at that moment through the darkness would have perceived that he was haggard stupid thunderstruck
at the moment when jon dee the said my name is the hardier marius had trembled in every limb and had leaned against the sail as though he felt the cold or a steel blade through his heart
then his right arm all ready to discharge the signals not dropped slowly and at the moment when jon dee the repeated the harrier do you understand
markus's faltering fingers had come near letting the pistol fall
jon dee the by revealing his identity had not moved m
leblanc but he had quite upset marius
that name of the hardier with which m
leblanc did not seem to be acquainted marius knew well
let the reader recall what that name meant to him
that name he had worn on his heart inscribed in his father's testament
before it at the bottom of his kind in the depths of his memory in that sacred injunction a certain then at died saved my life
if my son encounters him he will do him all the good that lies in his power
that name it will be remembered was one of the pie ties of his soul he mingled it with the name of his father in his worship
what
this man was that the barrier that innkeeper of mont vermeil whom he had so long and so vainly sought
he had found him at last and how
his father's saviour was a ruffian
that man to whose service marius was burning to devote himself was a monster
that liberator of colonel pont mercy was on the point of committing a crime whose scope markus did not as yet clearly comprehend but which resembled an assassination
and against whom great god
what a fatality
what a bitter mockery of date
his father had commanded him from the depths of his coffin to do all the good in his power to this the barrier and for four years marius bad cherished no other thought than to acquit this debt of his father's and at the moment when he was on the eve of having a brigand seized in the very act of crime by justice destiny cried to him this is the barrier
he could at last repay this man for his father's life saved amid a hailstorm of grapes hot on the heroic field of waterloo and repay it with the scaffold
he had sworn to himself that if ever be found that the barrier he would address him only by throwing himself at his feet and how he actually had found him but it was only to deliver him over to the executioner
his father said to hindus for the nerdier
and he replied to that adored and sainted voice by crushing the barrier
he was about to offer to his father in his grave the spectacle of that man who had torn him from death at the peril of his own life executed on the place saint jacques through the means of his son of that marius to whom he had entrusted that man by his will
and what a mockery to have so long worn on his breast his father's last commands written in his own hand only to act in so horribly contrary a sense
but on the other hand now look on that trap and not prevent it
condemn the victim and to spare the assassin
cool done be held to any gratitude towards so miserable a wretch
all the ideas which had just as she rushed for the last four years were pierced through and through as it were by this unforeseen blow
he shuddered
everything depended on him
unknown to themselves he held in his hand all those beings who were moving about there before his eyes
if he fired his pistol m
leblanc was saved and then we diet lost if he did not fire m
leblanc would be sacrificed and who knows
the barrier would escape
should be wash down the one or allow the other to fall
remorse awaited him in either case
what was metodo
what should be choose
be false to the most imperious souvenirs to all those solemn goes to himself to the most sacred duty to the most generated text
should be ignore his father's testament or allow the perpetration of a crime
on the one hand it seemed to him that he heard his urdu le suppl is a font for her father and on the other the colonel commending the hardier to his care
he felt that he was going mad
his knees gave way beneath him
and he had not even the time for deliberation so great was the fury with which the scene before his eyes was hastening to its catastrophe
it was like a whirlwind of which he had thought himself the master and which was now sweeping him away
he was on the verge of swooning
in the meantime the barrier whom we shall henceforth call by no other name was pacing up and down in front of the table in a sort of frenzy and wild triumph
he seized the candle in his fist and set it on the chimney piece with so violent a bang that the wick came near being extinguished and they allowed spattered the wall
then he turned tom
leblanc with a horrible look and spit out these words done for
smoked brown
cooked
's pitch cocked
and again he began to march back and forth in full eruption
ah
he cried so i've found you again at last mister philanthropist
mister threadbare million maine
mister giver of dolls
you open in ny
ah
so youdon''t recognize me
no it wasn' thou who came to hong vermeil to my inn eight years ago on christmas eve
it wasn' thou who carried off that bantine's child from me
the park
it wasn' thou who had a yellow great coat
no
nor a package of dues in your hand as you had this morning here
say wife it seems to be his mania to carry packets of woollen stockings into houses
old charity monger get out with you
are you who died mister million naire
you give away your stock on trade to the poor holy man
what bosh
merry andrew
ah
and youdon't recognize me
well i recognize you that i do
i recognized youth every moment you liked your shout in here
ah
you'll find out presently that itisn'ta'll roses to thrust yourself in that fashion into people's houses under the pretext that they are taverns in wretched clothes with the air of a poor man to whom one would give as ok to receive persons to play the gene ribs to take away their means of livelihood and to make threats in the woods and youcan't call things quite because afterwards when people are ruined you bring a coat that is too large and two miserable hospital blankets you old black guard you child stealer
he paused and seemed to be talking to himself for a moment
one would have said that his wrath had fallen into some mpls like the rhone then as though he were concluding aloud the things which he had been saying to himself in a whisper he smote the table with his fist and shouted and with his goody goody air
and a post to phi sign m
leblanc parmley
you made game of me in the past
you are the cause of all my misfortunes
for fifteen hundred francs you got a girl whom i had and who certainly belonged to rich people and who had already brought in a great deal of money and from whom i might have extracted enough to live on all my life
a girl who would have made up to me for every thing that i lost in that file cookshop where there was nothing but one continual row and where like a fool i ate up my last farthing
oh
i wish all the wine folks drank in my house had been poison to those who drank it
we'll never mind
say now
you must have thought he ridiculous when you went off with the park
you had your cudgel in the forest
you were the stronger
revenge
i'm the one to hold the trumps today
you're in a sorry case my goodfellow
oh but i can laugh
really i laugh
didn' the fall into the trap
i told him that i was an actor that my name was fagan you that i had played comedy with mansel le mars with mansell e niche that my landlord insisted on being paid tomorrow theft of february and he didn't even notice that they got january and not theft of february is the time when the quarter runs out
absurd idiot
and the four miserable philippe's which he has brought me
scoundrel
hehavn't the heart event pgk as high as a hundred francs
and how he swallowed my platitudes
that did amuse me
i said to myself' blockhead
some i've got you
i pick your pass this morning but i'll gnaw your heart this evening
' the barrier paused
he was out of breath
his little narrow cheat panted like a forge bellows
his eyes were full of the ignoble happiness of a feeble cruel and cowardly creature which finds that it can at last harass what it has feared and insult what it has flattered the joy of a dwarf who should be able to set his heel on the head of goliath the joy of a jackal which is beginning to rent a sick bull so nearly dead that he can no longer defend himself but sufficiently alive to suffer still
m
leblanc did not interrupt him but said to him when he paused i do not know what you mean to say
you are mistaken in me
i am a very poor man and anything but a million naire
i do not know you
you are mistaking me for some other person
ah
roared the barrier hoarsely a pretty lie
you stick to that pleasantry do you
you're floundering my old buck
ay
youdon''t remember
youdon''t see who i am
excuse me sir said m
leblanc with a politeness of accent which at that moment seemed peculiarly strange and powerful i see that you are a villain
who has not remarked the fact that odious creatures possess a susceptibility of their own that monsters are ticklish
at this word villa in the female the barrier sprang from the best he married grasped his chair as though he were about to crush it in his hands
don't you stir
he shouted to his wife and turning tom
leblanc villain
yes i know that you call us that you rich gentlemen
shop
it's true that i became bankrupt that i am in hiding that i have not read that i have not a single sou that i am a villain
it's three days since i have had any thing to eat soi'ma villain
ah
you folks warm your feet you have sako ski boots you have wadded great coats like archbishops you lodge on the first floor in houses that have porters you eat truffles you eat asparagus at forty francs the bunch in the month of january and green peas you forget ourselves and when you want to know whether it is cold you look in the papers to see what the engineer chevalier's thermometer says about it
wei to see who are thermometers
wedon't need to go out and look on the quay at the corner of the tour del' go to love to find out the number of degrees of cold we feel our blood con healing in our veins and the ice forming round our hearts and we say' there is no god
' and you come to our caverns yes our caverns for the purpose of calling us villains
but we'll devour you
but we'll devour you poor little things
just see here mister million naire i have been a solid man i have held a license i have been an elector i am a courteous that i am
and it's quite possible that you are not
here then at diet took a step towards the men who stood near the door and added with a shudder when i think that he has dared to come here and talk to me like a cobbler
then addressing m
leblanc with a fresh outburst of frenzy and listen to this also mister philanthropist
i'm not a suspicious character not a bit of it
i'm not a man whose name nobody knows and who comes and abducts choir ren from houses
i'm an old french soldier i ought to have been decorated
i was at waterloo so i was
and in the battle is aveda general called the comte if idon't know what
he told me his name but his beastly voice was so weak that i didn't year
all i caught washers it banks
i'd rather have had his name than his thanks
that would have helped me to find him again
the picture that you see here and which was painted by david at brushes files do you know what it represents
it represents me
david wished to immortalize that feat in prowess
i have that general on my back and i am carrying him through the grapes hot
there's the history of it
that general never did a single thing for me he was no better than the rest
but nonetheless i saved his life at the risk of my own and i have the certificate of the fact in my pocket
i am a soldier of waterloo by all the furies
and now that i have had the goodness to tell you all this let's have an end of it
i want money i want a deal of money i must have an enormous lot of money or i'll exterminate you by the thunder of the good god
marius had regained some measure of control over his anguish and was listening
the last possibility of doubt had just vanished
it certainly was the the barrier of the will
marius shuddered at that reproach of ingratitude directed against his father and which he was on the point of so fatally justifying
his perplexity was redoubled
moreover there was in all these words of the barrier in his accent in his gesture in his glance which darted flames at every word there was in this explosion of an evil nature disclosing everything in that mixture of braggadocio and abject ness of pride and pettiness of rage and folly in that chaos of real briefs and false sentiments in that i'm modesty of a malicious man tasting the voluptuous delights of violence in that shameless nudity of a repulsive soul in that conflagration of all sufferings combined with all hatred's something which was as hideous as evil and ashrae trending as the truth
the picture of the master the painting by david which he had proposed that m
leblanc should purchase was nothing else as the reader has divined than the sign of his tavern painted as it will be remembered by himself the only relic which he had preserved from his shipwreck at mont vermeil
as he had ceased to intercept marius' visual ray marius could examine this thing and in the daub he actually did recognize a battles background of smoke and a man carrying another man
it was the group composed of long mercy and the barrier the sergeant the rescuer the colonel rescued
marius was like a drunken man this picture restored his father to life in some sort it was no longer the sign board of the wine shop at mont vermeil it was a resurrection a tomb had yawned a phantom had risen there
marius heard his heart beating in his temples he had the cannon of waterloo in his ears his bleeding father vaguely depicted on that sinister panel terrified him and it seemed to him that the misshapen spectre was gazing intently at him
when the barrier had recovered his breath he turned his bloodshot eyes on m
leblanc and said to him in a low curt voice what have you to say before we put the handcuffs on you
m
leblanc held his peace
in the midst of this silence a cracked voice launched this lugubrious sarcasm from the corridor if there's an two or to be split i'm there
it was the man with the axe who was growing merry
at the same moment an enormous bristling and slayer face made its appearance at the door with a hideous laugh which exhibited not teeth but fangs
it was the face of the man with the butcher's axe
why have you taken off your mask
cried the barrier in a rage
for fun retorted the man
for the last few minutes j
leblanc had appeared to be watching and following all the movements of the barrier who blinded and dazzled by his own rate was stalking towns fro in the den with full confidence that the door was guarded and of holding an unarmed man fast he being armed him self of being nine against one supposing that the female then add usr counted for big one man
during his address to the man with the pole add he had turned his back to m
leblanc
m
leblanc seized this moment overturned the chair with his foot and the table with his fist and with one bound with prodigious ability before the barrier had time to turn round he had reached the window
to open it to scale the frame to be stride it was the work of a second only
he was half out when six robust fists seized him and dragged him back energetically into the novel
these were the three chimney builders who had flung themselves upon him
at the same time the the barrier woman had wound her hands in his hair
at the trampling which ensued the other ruffians rushed up from the corridor
the old man on the bed who seemed under their fluence of wine descended from the pallet and cake feeling up with a stone breaker's hammer in his hand
one of the chimney builders showed mira her face was lighted up by the candle and in whom marius recognized in spite of his day bingo and may dallas printable dallas big demaille lifted above m
leblanc's head a sort of bludgeon made of two balls of lead at the two ends of a bar of iron
marius could not resist this sight
my father he thought forgive me
and his finger sought the trigger of his pistol
the shot was on the point of being discharged when the hardier's voice shouteddon't harm him
this desperate attempt of the victim far from exasperating the hardier had calmed hum
there existed in him two men the ferocious man and the adroit man
up to that moment in the excess of his triumph in the presence of the prey which had been brought down and which did not stir the ferocious man had prevailed when the victim struggled and tried to resist the adroit man reappeared and took the upper hand
don't hurt him
he repeated and without suspecting it his first success was to arrest the pistol in the act of being discharged and to paralyze marius in whose opinion the urgency of the case disappeared and who in the face of this new phase saw no inconvenience in waiting awhile longer
who knows whether some chance would not arise which would deliver him from the horrible alternative of allowing hrs joe's father to perish or of destroying the colonel's saviour
a herculean struggle had begun
with one blow fill in the chest m
leblanc had sent the old man tumbling rolling in the middle of the room them with two backward sweeps of his hand he had overthrown two more assailants and he held one under each of his knees the wretched were rattling in the throat beneath this pressure as under a granite millstone but the other four had seized the formidable old man by both arms and the back of his neck and were holding him doubled up over the two chimney builders in the floor
thus the master of some and mastered by the rest crushing those beneath him and stifling under those on top of him endeavoring in vain to shake off all the efforts which were heaped upon him m
leblanc disappeared under the horrible group of ruffians like the wild boar beneath a howling pile of dogs and hounds
they succeeded in overthrowing him upon the bed nearest the window and there they held him in awe
the the barrier woman had not released her clutch in his hair
don't you mix yourself up in this affair said the barrier
you'll hear your shawl
the the barrier obeyed as the female wolf obeys the male wolf with a growl
now said the barrier search him to mother cell law
m
leblanc seemed to have renounced the idea of resistance
they searched him
he had nothing on his person except a leather purse containing six france and his handkerchief
the hardier put the handkerchief into his own pocket
what
no pocketbook
he demanded
non pr watch replied one of the chimney builders
nevermind murmured the masked man who carried the big key in the voice of a ventriloquist he's a tough old fellow
the barrier went to the corner near the door picked up a bundle of ropes and threw them at the men
tie him to the leg of the bed said he
and catching sight of the old man who had been stretched across the room by the flow from m
leblanc's fish and who made no movement be added is boulay ruelle dead
no replies big demaille he's drunk
sweep him into a corner said the barrier
two of the chimney builders pushed the drunken man into the corner near the heap of old iron with their feet
baber said the hardier in a low tone to the man with the cudgel why did you bring so many they were not needed
what can you do
replied the man with the cudgel they all wanted to be in it
this is a bad season
there's no business going in
the pallet on which m
leblanc had been thrown was a sort of hospital bed elevated on four coarse wooden legs roughly been
m
leblanc let them take their own course
the ruffians bound him securely in an upright attitude with his feet on the ground at the head of the best teens which was most remote from the window and nearest to the fireplace
when the last knot had been tied the barrier took a chair and seated himself almost facing m
leblanc
the barrier no longer looked like himself in the course of a few moments his face had passed from unbridled violence to tranquil and cunning sweetness
marius found it difficult to recognize in that polished smile if a man in official life the almost bestial mouth which had been blaming but a moment before he gazed with amazement of that fantastic and alarming metamorphosis and he felt as a man might feel who should be hold a tiger converted into a lawyer
monsieur said the barrier
and dismissing with a gesture the ruffians who still kept their hands on m
leblanc standoff a little and let me have a talk with the gentleman
all retired towards the door
he went on monsieur you did wrong to try to jump out of the window
you might have broken your leg
now if you will permit me we will converse quietly
in the first place i must communicate to you an observation which i have made which is that you have not uttered the faintest cry
the barrier was right this detail was correct although it had escaped marius in his agitation
m
leblanc had barely pronounced a few words without raising his voice and even during his struggle with the six ruffians near the window he had preserved the most profound and singular silence
the barrier continued mon dieu
you might have shouted's top thief' a bit and i should not have thought it improper
' murder
' that too is said occasionally and so far as i am concerned i should not have taken it in bad part
it is very natural that you should make a little row when you find yourself with persons whodon't inspire you with sufficient confidence
you might have done that and noone would have troubled you on that account
you would not even have been tagged
and i will tell you why
this room is very private
that's it's only recommendation but it has that in its favor
you might fire off a mortar and it would produce about as much noise at the nearest police station as the shores of a drunken man
here a cannon would make a blum and the thunder would make a loud
it's a handy lodging
but in short you did not shout and it is better so
i present you my compliments and i will tell you the conclusion that i draw from that fact my dear sir when a man shouted to conds
the police
and after the police
justice
well
you have not made an outcry that is because youdon''t care to have the police and the courts come in any more than we do
it is because i have long suspected if you have some interest in hiding something
in our side we have the same interest
so we can come to an understanding
as he spoke thus it seemed as though the barrier who kept his eyes fixed on m
leblanc were trying to plunge the sharp points which darted from the pupils into the very conscience of his prisoner
moreover his language which was stamped with a sort of moderated subdued insolence and crafty in silence was reserved and almost choice and in that rascal who had been nothing but a robber a short time previously one now felt the man who had studied for the priesthood
the silence preserved by the prisoner that precaution which had been carried to the point of forgetting all anxiety for his own life that resistance opposed to the first impulse of nature which is to utter a cry all this it must be confessed now that his attention has been called to it troubled marius and affected him with painful astonishment
the barrier's well grounded observation still further obscured for marius the dense mystery which envelopes that brave and singular person on whom source trac had bestowed the sobriquet of monsieur le blanc
but whoever he was bound with ropes surrounded with executioner's half plunged so to speak in a grave which was closing in upon him to the extent of a degree with every moment that passed in the presence of the barrier's wrath as in the presence of his sweetness this man remained in passive and marlis could not refrain from admiring at such a moment the shows fly melancholy visage
here evidently was a soul which was inaccessible to terror and which did not know the meaning of despair
here was one of those men who command amazement in desperate circumstances
extreme as was the crisis inevitable as was the catastrophe there was nothing here of the agony of the drowning man who opens his horror filled eyes under the water
the barrier to a woman in pretending manner went to the fireplace shoved aside the screen which he leaned against the neighboring pallet and thus unmasked the brazier full of glowing coals in which the prisoner could plainly see the chisel white hot and spotted here and there with tiny scarlet stars
then the barrier returned to his seat beside m
leblanc
i continue said he
we can come to an understanding
let us arrange this matter in an amicable way
i was wrong to lose my temper just now idon't know what i was thinking of i went a great deal too far i said extravagant things
for example because you are a million naire i hope you that i exacted money alot of money a deal of money
that would not be reasonable
mon dieu in spite of your riches you have expenses of your own who has not
idon't want to ruin you i am not a greedy fellow after all
i am not one of those people who because they have the advantage of the position profit by the fact to make themselves ridiculous
why i'm taking things into consideration and making a sacrifice on my side
i only want two hundred thousand francs
m
lego and uttered not a word
the barrier went on you see that i put not a little water in my wine i'm very moderate
idon't know the state of your fortune but i do know that youdon''t stick at money and a benevolent man like yourself can certainly give two hundred thousand francs to the father of a family who is out of luck
certainly you are reason able too you haven't imagined that i should take all the trouble i have today and it ga hi add this affair this evening which has been labor we'll be stowed in the opinion of the seven for men merely to wind up by asking you for enough to go and drink red wine at fifteen sous and ear vea la tees boyer's
two hundred thousand francs it's surely worth all that
this trifle once out of your pocket i guarantee you that that's the end of the matter and that you have no further demands to fear
you will say to me' but i haven't two hundred thousand francs about me
' oh
i'm not extortionate
idon't demand that
i only ask one thing if you
have the goodness to write what i am about to dictate to you
here the hard nrg paused then he added emphasizing his words and casting a smile in the direction of the brazier i warn you that i shall not admit that youdon't know how to write
a grand inquisitor might have envied that smile
the barrier pushed the table close to m
leblanc and took an inlet and a pen and a sheet of paper from the drawer which he left half open and in which gleamed the long blade of the knife
he placed the sheet of paper before m
leblanc
write said he
the prisoner spoke at last
how do you expect me to write
i am bound
that's true excuse me
ejaculated the nerdier you are quite right
and turning to big demaille untie the gentleman's right arm
landhaus alias print an ideal is a big demaille executed the barrier's order
when the prisoner's right arm was free the barrier dipped the pen in the ink and presented it to him
understand thoroughly sir that you are in our power at our discretion that no human power can get you out of this and that we shall be really grieved if we are forced to proceed to disagreeable extremities
i know neither your name nor your address but i warn you that you will remain bound until the person charged with carrying the letter which you are about to write shall have returned
now be so good as to write
what
demanded the prisoner
i will dictate
m
leblanc took the pen
then a raise began to dictate my daughter the prisoner shuddered and raised his eyes to the barrier
put down' my dear daughter' said the barrier
m
leblanc obeyed
the barrier continued come instantly he paused you address her as thou do you not
who
asked m
leblanc
par bleu
cried the barrier the little one the park
m
leblanc replied without the slightest apparent emotion i do not know what you mean
go on nevertheless ejaculated the barrier and he continued to dictate come immediately i am in absolute need of the e
the person who will deliver this note to thee is instructed to conduct the stone
i am waiting for the e
come with confidence
m
leblanc had written the whole of this
the barrier resumed at
erase' come with confidence' that might lead her to suppose that everything was not as it should be and that distrust is possible
m
leblanc erased the three words
now pursued the barrier sign it
what's your name
the prisoner laid down the pen and demanded for whom is this letter
you know well retorted the barrier for the little one i just told you so
it was evident that the barrier avoided naming the young girl in question
he said the park he said the little one but he did not pronounce her name the precaution of a clever man guarding his secret from his accomplices
to mention the game was to deliver the whole affair into their hands and to tell them more about it than there was any need of their knowing
he went on sign
what is your name
urbain fabre said the prisoner
the barrier with the movement of a car washes his hand into his pocket and drew out the handkerchief which had been seized on m
leblanc
he looked for the mark on it and held it close to the candle
u
f
that's it
urbain fabre
well dignity
f
the prisoner signed
as two hands are required to fold the letter give it to me i will fold it
that dons the hardier resumed address it' mademoiselle range' at your house
i know that you live a long distance from here near saint jacques du haut pas because you go to mass there everyday but idon't know in what street
i see that you understand your situation
as you have not lied about your name you will not lie about your address
write it yourself
the prisoner paused thoughtfully for a moment then he took the pen and wrote mademoiselle fa breath
urbain favre's rue saint dominiqued' enter no.
the barriers sized the letter with a sort of feverish convulsion
wife
he cried
the the hardier woman hastened to him
here's the letter
you know what you have to do
there is a carriage at the door
set out at once and return ditto
and addressing the man with the meat axe since you have taken off your nose screen accompany the mistress
you will get up behind the discre
you know where you left the team
yes said the man
and depositing his axe in a corner he followed madame the harriet
as they set off the hardier thrust his head through the half open door and shouted into the corridor above all thingsdin't lose the letter
remember that you carry two hundred thousand francs with you
the the barrier's hoarse voice replied be easy
i have it in my bosom
a minute had not elapsed when the sound of the cracking of a ship was heard which rapidly retreated and died away
good
growled the barrier
they're going at above lace
at such a gallop the bourgeois e will be back inside three quarters of an hour
he drew a chair close to the fireplace folding his arms and presenting his muddy boots to the brazier
my feet are sold
said he
only five ruffians now remained in the ten with the barrier and the prisoner
these men through the black masks or paste which covered their faces and made of them at fear's pleasure charcoal burners negroes of demons had a stupid and gloomy air and it could be felt that they perpetrated a crime like a bit of work tranquilly without either wrath of mercy with a sort of ennui
they were crowded together in one corner like brutes and remained silent
the barrier warned his feet
the prisoner had relapsed into his taciturn ity
a sombre calm had succeeded to the wild uproar which had filled the garter but a few moments before
the candle on which a large stranger had formed cast but a dim light in the immense hovel the brazier had grown dull and all those monstrous heads fast misshapen shadows on the walls and ceiling
no sound was audible except the quiet breathing of the old drunken man who was fast asleep
marius waited in a state of anxiety that was augmented by every trifle
the enigma was more impenetrable than ever
who was this little one whom the barrier had called the lark
was when i sure ule
the prisoner had not seemed to be affected by that word the park and had replied in the most natural manner in the world i do not know what you mean
on the other hand the two letters u
f
were explained they meant urbain fabre and urdu le was no longer make sure how
this was what marius perceived most clearly of all
a sort of horrible fascination held him nailed to his post from which he was observing and commanding this whole scene
there he stood almost incapable of movement of reflection as though annihilated by the abominable things viewed at such close quarters
he waited in the hope of some incident no matter of what nature since he could not collect his thoughts and did not know upon what course to decide
in any case he said if she is the park i shall see her for the the barrier woman is to bring her mother
that will be the end and then i will give my life and my blood if necessary but i will deliver her
nothing shall stop me
nearly half an hour passed in this banner
the married seemed to be absorbed in gloomy reflections the prisoner did not stir
still marius fancied that at intervals and for the last few moments he had heard a faint full noise in the direction of the prisoner
all at once the barrier addressed the prisoner by the way monsieur fabre i might as well say it to you at once
these few words appeared to be the beginning of an explanation
marius strained his ears
my wife will be back shortlydon't get impatient
i think that the park really is your daughter and it seems to me quite natural that you should keep her
only listen to me a bit
my wife will go and gunther up with your letter
i told my wife to dress herself in the way she did so that your young lady might make no difficulty about following her
they will both enter the carriage with my comrade behind
somewhere outside the barrier there is a trap harnessed to two very good horses
your young lady will be taken to it
she will a light from the flag re
my comrade will enter the other vehicle with her and my wife will come back here to tell us' it's done
' as for the young lady no harm will be done to her the trap will conduct her to a place where she will be quiet and just as soon as you have handed over time those little two hundred thousand francs she will be returned to you
if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the lark that's all
the prisoner uttered not a syllable
after a pause the barrier continued it's very simple as you see
there'll be no harm done unless you wish that there should be harm done
i'm telling you how things stand
i warn you do that you may be prepared
he paused the prisoner did not break the silence and the barrier resumed as soon as my wife returns and says to me' the park is on the way' we will release you and you will be free to go and sleep at home
you see that our intentions are not evil
terrible images passed through marius' mind
what
that young girl whom they were abducting was not to be brought back
one of those monsters was to be after off into the darkness
whither
and what if it were she
it was clear that it was she
marius felt his heart stop beating
what was metodo
discharge the pistol
place all those sci in feels in the hands of justice
but the horrible man with the meat axe would nonetheless be out of reach with the young girl and marius reflected on the barrier's words of which he perceived the bloody significance if you have me arrested my comrade will give a turn of his thumb to the park
now it was not alone by the colonel's testament it was by his own love it was by the peril of the one he loved that he felt himself restrained
this frightful situation which had already lasted above half an hour was changing its aspect every moment
marius had sufficient strength of mind to review in succession all the most heartbreaking conjectures seeking hope and finding none
the tumult of his thoughts contrasted with the funereal silence of the den
in the midst of this silence the door at the bottom of the staircase was heard to open and shut again
the prisoner made a movement in his bonds
here's the bourgeois e said then we diet
he had hardly uttered the words when the the barrier woman did in fact rush hastily into the room ted panting breathless with flaming eyes and cried as she's note her huge hands on her thighs simultaneously false address
the ruffian who had gone with her made his appearance behind her and picked up his axe again
she resumed nobodythere
rue saint dkk unique no
no monsieur urbain fabre
they know not what it means
she paused smoking then went on monsieur the barrier
that old fellow has duped you
you are too good you see
if it had been me i'd have stopped the beast in four quarters to begin with
and if he had acted ugly i'd have boiled him alive
he would have been obliged to speak and say where the girl is and where he keeps his stoners
that's the way i should have managed matters
people are perfect it right when they say that men are a deal stupider than women
nobody at no
it's nothing but a big carriage gate
no monsieur fabre in the rue saint dominique
and after all that racing and fee to the coachman and all
i spoke to both the porter and the ported as a finest out woman and they know nothing about him
marius breathed freely once more
's heirs up for the park be no longer knew what to call her was safe
while his exasperated wife dog iterated the barrier had seated himself in the table
for several minutes he uttered not a word but swung his right foot which hung down and stared at the brazier with an air of savage're very
finally he said to the prisoner with a slow and singularly ferocious to be a false address
what did you expect to gain by that
to gain time
cried the prisoner in a thundering voice and at the same instant he shook off his bonds they were cut
the prisoner was only attached to the bed now by one leg
before the seven men had time to collect their senses and fast forward he had bent down into the fireplace had stretched out his hand to the brazier and bad then straightened himself up again and now the barrier the female the barrier and the ruffians huddled in amazement at the extremity of the novel stared at him in style fashion as almost free and in a formidable attitude he brandished above his head the red hot chisel which emitted a threatening glow
the judicial examination to which the ambush in the gorge au house eventually gave rise established the fact that a large so i piece cut and worked in a peculiar fashion was found in the garret when the police made their descent on it
this so i piece was one of those marvels of industry which are engendered by the patience of the valleys in the shadows and for the shadows marvels which are nothing else than instruments of escape
these hideous and delicate products of wonderful art are to jewellers' work what the metaphors of slang are to poetry
there are benvenuto cellini's in the galleys just as there are dillon's in language
the unhappy wretch who aspires to deliverance find a means sometimes without tools sometimes with a common wooden handles knife rosa was ok into two thin plates to hollow out these plates without affecting the coinage stamp and to make a furrow in the edge of the sky in such a manner that the plates will adhere again
this can be screwed together and unscrewed at will it is xbox
in this box he hides a watch spring and this watch spring properly handled cuts good sized chains and bars of iron
the unfortunate convict is supposed to possess merely as i unit shall be possessed liberty
it was a large soy of this sort which during the subsequent search of the police was found under the bed near the window
they also found a tiny saw of blue steel which would fit the sou
it is probable that the prisoner had this son piece on his person at the moment when the ruffians searches him that he contrived to conceal it in his hand and that afterward having his right hand fresh egg screwed it and used it as a sad to cut the cords which fastened him which would explain the faint noise and almost imperceptible movements which marius had observed
as he had not been able to bend down for fear of betraying himself he had not cut the bonds of his left leg
the ruffians had recovered from their first surprise
be easy said big demaille to the barrier
he still holds by one leg and hecan't getaway
i'll answer for that
i tied that law for him
in the meanwhile the prisoner had begun to speak you are wretches but my life is not worth the trouble or defending it
when you think that you can make me speak that you can make me write what i do not choose to write that you can make me say what i do not choose to say he stripped up his left sleeve and added see here
at the same moment he extended his arm and laid the glowing chisel which he held in his left hand by its wooden handle on his bare flesh
the crackling of the burning flesh became audible and the odor peculiar to chambers of torture filled the novel
illustration red hot chisel free hot chisel markus reeled in utter horror the very ruffians shuddered hardly a muscle of the old man's face contracted and while the red hot iron sank into the smoking wound impassive and almost august be fixed on the barrier his beautiful glance in which there was no hatred and where suffering vanished in serene majesty
with grand and lofty nature's the revolts of the flesh and the senses when subjected to physical suffering cause the soul to spring forth and make it appear on the brow just as rebellions among the soldiery force the captain to show himself
wretches
said he have no more fear of me than i have for you
and tearing the chisel from the wound he hurled it through the window which had been left open the horrible glowing tool disappeared into the night whirling as it flew and fell far away on the snow
the prisoner resumed do what you please with me
he was disarmed
seize him
said the hardier
two of the ruffians laid their hands on his shoulder and the masked man with the ventriloquist's voice took up his station in front of him ready to smash his skull at the slightest movement
at the same time marius heard below him at the base of the partition but so near that he could not see who was speaking this colloquy conducted in a low tone there is only one thing left to do
cut his throat
that's it
it was the husband and wife taking counsel together
the barrier walked slowly tower as the table opened the drawer and took out the knife
marius fretted with the handle of his pistol
unprecedented perplexity
for the last hour he had had two voices in his conscience the one enjoining him to respect his father's testament the other trying to him to rescue the prisoner
these two voices continued uninterruptedly that struggle which tormented him to agony
up to that moment he had cherished a vague hope that he should find some means of reconciling these two duties but nothing within the limits of possibility had presented itself
however the period as urgent the last bounds of delay had been reached the barrier was standing thoughtfully a few paces distant from the prisoner
ha glu a cast a wild glance about him the last mechanical resource of despair
all at once a shudder ran through him
at his feet on the table a bright day of light from the full moon illuminated and seemed to point out to him a sheet of paper
on this paper he read the following line written that very morning in large letters by the eldest of the the hardier girls the hobbies are here
an idea a flash crossed marius' mind this was the expedient of which he was in search the solution of that frightful problem which was torturing him of sparing the ass ass jj and saving the victim
he knelt down on his commode stretched out his arm seized the sheet of paper softly detached a bit of plaster from the wall wrapped the paper round of and tossed the whole through the crevice into the middle of the den
it was high time
the hardier had conquered his last fears of his last scruples and was advancing on the prisoner
something is falling
cried the the barrier woman
what is it
asked her husband
the woman darted forward and picked up the bit of plaster
she handed it to her husband
where did this come from
demanded the barrier
pardue
ejaculated his wife where do you suppose it came from
through the window of course
i saw it pass said big de gaulle
the hardier rapidly unfolded the paper and held it close to the candle
it's info on one's handwriting
the devil
he made a sign to his wife who hastily drew near and showed her the line written on the sheet of paper then he added in a subdued voice quick
the ladder
let's leave the bacon in the mouse trap and decamp
without cutting that man's throat
asked the the barrier woman
we haven't the time
through what
resumed big demaille
through the window replied the barrier
since po nine has thrown the stone through the window it indicates that the house is not watched on that side
the mask with the ventriloquist's voice deposited his huge key on the floor raised both arms in the air and opened and clenched his fists three times rapidly without uttering a word
this was the signal like the signal for clearing the decks for action onboard ship
the ruffians who were holding the prisoner released him in the twinkling of an eye the rope ladder was unrolled outside the window and solidly fastened to the soil by the two iron books
the prisoner paid no attention to what was going on around him
he seemed to be dreaming of praying
as soon as the ladder was arranged the barrier cried come
the bourgeois e. first
and he rushed headlong to the window
but just as he was about to throw his leg over bit demaille seized him roughly by the collar
not much come now you old dog after us
after us
yelled the ruffians
you are children said the barrier we are losing time
the police are on our heels
well said the ruffians let's draw lots to see who shall go down first
the married exclaimed are you mad
are you crazy
what a lack of boobies
you want to waste time do you
draw lots do you
by a wet finger by a short straw
with written names
thrown into a hat
would you like my hat
cried a voice on the threshold
all wheeled round
it was javert
he had his hat in his hand and was holding it out to them with a smile
chapter xxi one should always begin by arresting the victims at nightfall javert had posted his men and had gone into an bush himself between the trees of the rue de la barriers des gobelins which faced the gorge au house on the other side of the boulevard
he had begun operations by opening his pockets and dropping into it the two young girls who were charged with keeping a watch on the approaches to the den
but he had only cared a selma
a store po nine she was no rather posts he had disappeared and he had not been able to seize her
then javert had made a point and had bent his ear to waiting for the signal agreed upon
the comings and goings of the fi acres had greatly agitated hom
at last he had grown impatient and sure that there was a nest there sure of being in luck having recognized many of the ruffians who had entered he had finally decided to go upstairs without waiting for the pistol shot
it will be remembered that he had marius' passkey
he had arrived just in the nico of time
the terrified ruffians flung themselves on the arms which they had abandoned in all the corners at the moment of flight
in less than a second these seven men horrible to behold had grouped themselves in an attitude of defence one with his meat add another with his key another with his bludgeon the rest with shears pincers and hammers
the barrier had his knife in his fist
the the barrier woman snatched up an enormous paving stone which lay in the angle of the window and served her daughters as an ottoman
illustration snatched up a paving stone b paving stone javert put on his hat again and advanced a couple of paces into the room with arms folded his cane under one arm his sword in its sheath
halt there said he
you shall not go out by the window you shall go through the door
it's less unhealthy
there are seven of you there are fifteen of us
don't let's fall to collating each other like men of auvergne
big demaille drew out a pistol which he had kept concealed under his blouse and put it in the barrier's hand whispering in the latter's ear it's javert
idon't were fire at that man
do you date
par bley
replied the harriet
well then fire
the gardner took the pistol and aimed at javert
javert who was only three pages from him stated intently at him and contented himself with saying come nowdon't fire
you'll miss fire
then sevier pulled they rigger
the pistol missed fire
didn'ti tell you so
ejaculated javert
big demaille flung his bludgeon at javert's feet
you're the emperor of the fiends
i surrender
and you
javert asked the rest of the ruffians
they replied so do we
havent began again calmly that's right that's good i said so you are nice fellows
i only ask one thing said big demaille and that is that i may not be denied tobacco while i am in confinement
granted said javert
and turning round and falling behind him come in now
a squad of policemen sword in hand and agents armed with bludgeon sand cudgels rushed in at javert's summons
theyl' union rd the ruffians
this throng of men's lately lighted by the single candle filled the density shadows
handcuff the mall
shouted javert
some of
cried a voice which was not the voice of a man but of which no one wkh is ever have said it is a woman's voice
the then a rdiff woman had entrenched herself in one of the angles of the window and it was she who had just given vent to this road
the policemen and agents recoiled
she had thrown off her shawl but retained her bonnet her husband who was crouching behind her was almost hidden under the discarded shawl and she was shielding him with her body wash delegated the paving stone above her head with the gesture of a giantess on the point of hurling a rock
beware
she shouted
all crowded back towards the corridor
a broad open space was cleared in the middle of the garret
the the barrier woman cast a glance at the ruffians who had allowed themselves to be pinion ed and muttered in hoarse and guttural accents the cowards
javert smiled and advanced across the open space which the the barrier was devouring with her eyes
don't come near me she cried or i'll crush you
what a grenadier
ejaculated javert you've got a beard like a man mother but i have class like a woman
and he continues to advance
the the barrier dishevelled and terrible set her feet far apart threw herself backwards and hurled the paving stone at javert's head
javert ducked the stone passed over him struck the wall behind knocked off a huge piece of plastering and rebounding from angle to angle across the novel now luckily almost empty rested at javert's feet
at the same moment javert reached the the barrier couple
one of his big hands descended on the woman's shoulder the other on the husband's head
the handcuffs
he shouted
the policemen group rein in force and in a few seconds javert's order had been executed
the the barrier female overwhelmed stared at her pink ones hands and at those of her husband who had dropped to the floor and exclaimed weeping my daughters
they are in the jun said javert
in the meanwhile the agents had caught sight of the drunken man asleep behind the door and were shaking him he awoke stammering is it all over jon dee the
yes replied javert
the six pink ones ruffians were standing and still preserved their spectral mien all three be smeared with black all three masked
keep on your masks said javert
and passing them in review with a glance of a frederick ii
at a potsdam parade he said to the three chimney builders good day big demaille
good day bruno n
good day deux milliards
then turning to the three masked men he said to the man with the meat axe good day guru kemer
and to the man with the cudgel good day babe t
and to the ventrilo quiet your health spa queso us
at that moment he caught sight of the ruffians' prisoner who ever since the entrance of the police had not uttered sword and had held his head down
untie the gentleman
said javert and let no one go out
that said he seated himself with sovereign dignity before the table where the candle and the writing materials still remained drew a stamped paper from his pocket and began to prepare his report
when he had written the first lines which are formulas that never vary he raised his eyes is true gentleman whom these gentlemen bound step forward
the policemen glanced round them
well said javert where is he
the prisoner of the ruffian am
leblanc m
urbain fabre the father of its up for the park had disappeared
the door was guarded but the window was not
as soon as he had found himself released from his bonds and while javert was drawing up his report he had taken advantage of confusion the crowd the darkness and of a moment when the general attention was diverted from him to wash out of the window
an agent sprang to the opening and looked out
he saw no one outside
the rope ladder was still shaking
the devil
ejaculated javert between his teeth he must have been the most valuable of the lot
chapter xxii the little one who was crying in volume two on the day following that on which these events took place in the house on the boulevard del' hopital a child who seemed to be coming from the direction of the bridge of austerlitz was ascending the side alley on the right in the direction of the barriers de fontainebleau
night had fully come
this lad was pale thin clad in rats with linen trousers in the month of february and was singing at the top of his voice
at the corner of the rue du petit bag quiet agent old woman was rummaging in a heap of refuse by the light of a street lantern the child jostled her as he passed the need oiled exclaiming hello
and i took it for an enormous enormous dog
he pronounced the word enormous the second time with a meeting swell of the voice which might be tolerably well represented by capital's an enormous enormous dog
the old woman straightened herself up in a fury

she grumbled

the boy was already far away

he cried
after that idon't think i was mistaken
the old woman choking with indignation now rose completely upright and the red gleam of the lantern fully lighted up her livid face all hollowed into angles and wrinkles with crow's been meeting the corners of her mouth
her body was lost in the darkness and only her head was visible
one would have pronounced her a mask of decrepitude carved out by a light from the night
the boy surveyed her
madame said he does not possess that style of beauty which pleases me
he then pursued his road and resumed his single do i could esa boys' em all alta la chasse a la chasse aux for beaux at the end of these three lines he paused
he had arrived in front of no
and finding the door fastened he began to assault it with resounding and heroic kicks which betrayed rather the man's shoes that he was wearing than the child's feet which he owned
in the meanwhile the very old woman whom he had encountered at the corner of the rue du petit ban quiet hastened up behind him uttering clamorous cries and indulging in lavish and exaggerated gestures

the old woman retorted with a composite grimace and a wonderful improvisation of hatred taking advantage of feebleness and ugliness which was unfortunately wasted in the dark there's no one here

a few pages of history chapter i. we'll cut and the two years which are immediately connected with the revolution of july form one of the most peculiar and striking moments of history
these two years rise like two mountains midway between those which precede and those which follow them
they have a revolutionary grandeur
precipices are to be distinguished there
the social masses the very as sizes of civilization the solid group of superposed and adhering interests the century old profiles of the ancient french formation appear and disappear in them every instant athwart the storm clouds of systems of passions and of theories
these appearances and disappearances have been designated as movement and resistance
at intervals truth that daylight of the human soul can be descried shining there
this remarkable epoch is decidedly circumscribed and is beginning to be sufficiently distant from us to allow if our grasping the principal lined even at the present day
we shall make the attempt
the restoration had been one of those intermediate phase's hard to define in which there is fatigue buzzing murmurs sleep tumult and which are nothing else than the arrival of a great nation at a halting place
these epochs are peculiar and mislead the politicians who desire to convert them to profit
in the beginning the nation as is nothing but repose it thirsts for but one thing peace it has but one ambition to be small
which is the translation of remaining tranquil
of great events great hazards great adventures great men thank god we have seen enough we have them heaped higher than our heads
we would exchange caesar for pru size and napoleon for the king of y de tot
what a good little king waste
we have marched since daybreak we have reached the evening of a long and toil someday we have made our first change with mirabeau the second with robespierre the third with bonaparte we are worn out
each one demands a bed
devotion which is weary heroism which has grown old ambitions which are dated fortunes which are made seek demand implore solicit what
a shelter
they have it
they take possession of peace of tranquillity of leisure behold they are content
but at the same time certain facts arise compel recognition and knock at the door in their turn
these facts are the products of revolutions and wars they are they exist they have the right to install themselves in society and they do install themselves therein and most of the time facts are the stewards of the household and four odds who do nothing but prepare lodgings for principles
this then is what appears to philosophical politicians at the same time that weary men demand repose accomplished facts demand guarantees
guarantees are the same to facts that repose is to men
this is what england demanded of the stuarts after the protector this is what france demanded of the bourbons after the empire
these guarantees are a necessity of the times
they must be accorded
prince a grant them but in reality it is the force of things which gives them
a profound truth and one useful to know which the stuarts did not suspect in and which the bourbons did not even obtain a glimpse of in.
the predestined family which returned to france when napoleon fell had the fatal simplicity to believe that it was itself which bestowed and that what it had bestowed it could take back again that the house of bourbon possessed the right divine that france possessed nothing and that the political right conceded in the charter of louis xviii
was merely a branch of the right divine was detached by the house of bourbon and graciously given to the people until such day as it should please the king to re assume it
still the house of bourbon should have felt from the displeasure created by the gift that it did not come from it
this house was churlish to the nineteenth century
it put on an ill tempered look at every development of the nation
to make use of a trivial word that is to say of a popular and a true word it looked glu n
the people saw this
it thought it possessed strength because the empire had been carried away before it like a theatrical stage setting
it did not perceive that it had itself been brought in. in the same fashion
it did not perceive that it also lay in that hand which had removed napoleon
in thought that it has roots because it was the past
it was mistaken it formed a part of the past but the whole paste as france
the roots of french society were not fixed in the bourbons but in the nations
these obscure and lively roots constituted not the right of a family but the history of a people
they were everywhere except under the throne
the house of bourbon was torrance the illustrious and bleeding knit in her history but was no longer the principal element of her destiny and the necessary base of her politics
she could get along without the bourbons she had done without them for two and twenty years there had been a break of continuity they did not suspect the fact
and how should they have suspected if they who fancied that louis xvii
reigned one method thermidor and that louis xviii
was reigning at the battle of marengo
never since the origin of history had prince's been so blind in the presence of facts and the portion of docume authority which facts contain and promulgate
never had that pretension here below which is called the right of kings denied to such a point the right from on high
a capital error which left his family to latifah and once more in the guarantees granted in on the concessions as it termed the m
sad
a sad thing
what it termed it's concessions were out conquests what it termed our encroachments were our rights
when the hour seemed to it to have come the restoration supposing itself victorious over bonaparte and well rooted in the country that is to say believing itself to be strong and deep abruptly decided on its plan of action and risk edits stroke
one morning it drew itself up before the face of france and elevating it's voice it contested the collective title and the individual right of the nation to sovereignty of the citizen to liberty
in other words it denied to the nation that which made it a nation and to the citizen that which made him a citizen
this is the foundation of those famous acts which are called the ordinances of july
the restoration fell
it fell justly
but we admit it had not been absolutely hostile to all forms of progress
great things had been accomplished with it alongside
under the restoration the nation had grown accustomed to calm discussion which had been lacking under the republicans to grandeur in peace which had been wanting under the empire
france free and strong had offered an encouraging spectacle to the other peoples of europe
the revolution had had the word under robespierre the canyon had had the word under bonaparte it was under louis xviii
and charles x
that it was the turn of intelligence to have the word
the wind ceased the torch was lighted once more
on the lofty heights the pure light of mind could be seen flickering
a magnificent useful and charming spectacle
for a space of fifteen years those great principles which are so old for the thinker cones for the statesman could be seen at work in perfect peace on the public square equality before the law liberty of conscience liberty of speech liberty of the press the accessibility of all aptitudes to all functions
thus it proceeded until
the bourbons were an instrument of civilization which broke in the hands of providence
the fall of the bourbons was full of grandeur not on their side but in the side of the nation
they quitted the throne with gravity but without authority their descent into the night was not one of those solemn disappearances which leave a sombre emotion in history it was neither the spectral calm of charles i.
nor the eagles cream of napoleon
they departed that is all
they laid down the crown and retained no aureole
they were worthy but they were not august
they lacked in a certain measure the majesty of their misfortune
charles x
during the voyage from cherbourg causing a roundtable to be cut over into a square table appeared to be more anxious about imperil led etiquette than about the crumbling monarchy
this diminution saddened devoted men who loved their persons and serious men who honored their race
the populace was admirable
the nation attacked one morning with weapons by a sort of royal insurrection felt itself in the possession of so much force that it did not go into a rage
it defended itself restrained itself restored things to their places the government to law the bourbons to exile alas
and then halted
it took the old king charles x
from beneath that said which had sheltered louis xiv
and set him gently on the ground
it touched the royal personages only with sadness and precaution
it was not one man it was not a few men it was france france entire france victorious and intoxicated with her victory who seemed to be coming to herself and who put into practice before the eyes of the whole world these grave words of guillaume du fait after the day of the barricades it is easy for those who are accustomed to skim the favors on the great and to spring like a bird from bought i bought roman afflicted fortune to a flourishing one to show themselves harsh towards their prince in his adversity but as for me the fortune of my kings and especially of my afflicted kings will always be venerable home
the bourbons carried away with them respect but not regret
as we have just stated their misfortune was greater than they were
they faded out in the horizon
the revolution of july instantly had friends and enemies throughout the entire world
the first rushed toward her with joy and enthusiasm the others turned away each according to his nature
at the first blush the princes of europe the owls of this dawn shut their eyes wounded and stupefied and only opened them to threaten
a bright which can be comprehended a wrath which can be pardoned
this strange revolution had hardly produced a shock it had not even paid to vanquished royalty the honor of treating it as an enemy and of shedding its blood
in the eyes of despotic governments who are always interested in having liberty c alumni are itself the revolution of july committed the fault of being formidable and of remaining gentle
nothing however was attempted or plotted against it
the most discontented the most irritated the most trembling saluted it whatever our egotism and our rancor may be a mysterious respect springs from events in which we are sensible of the collaboration of someone who is working above man
the revolution of july is the triumph of right overthrowing the fact
a thing which is full of splendor
right overthrowing the fact
hence the brilliancy of the revolution of hence also its mildness
right triumphant has no need of being violent
right of the just and the true
the property of right is to remain eternally beautiful and pure
the fact even when most necessary to all appearances even when most thoroughly accepted by contemporaries of it exist only as a fact and if it contain only too little of right or none at all is infallibly destined to become in the course of time deformed impure perhaps even monstrous
if one desires to learn stone blow to what degree of hideous ness the fact can attain viewed at the rich and for centuries let him look at machiavelli
machiavelli is not an evil genius not a demon not a miserable and cowardly writer he is nothing but the fact
and he is not only the italian fact he is the european fact the fact of the sixteenth century
he seems hideous and so he is in the presence of the moral idea of the nineteenth
this conflict of right and fact has been going on ever since the origin of society
to terminate this duel to amalgamate the pure idea with the humane reality to cause right to penetrate pacific ally into the fact and the fact into right that is the task of wages
chapter ii badly sewer but the task of wages is one thing the task of clever menus another
the revolution of came to a sudden halt
as soon as a revolution has made the coast the skilful make haste to prepare the shipwreck
the skilful in our century have conferred on themselves the title of statesmen so that this word statesmen has ended by becoming somewhat of a slang word
it must be borne in mind in fact that wherever there is nothing but skill there is necessarily pettiness
to say the skilful amounts to saying the mediocre
in the same way to say statesmen is sometimes equivalent to saying traitors
if then we are to believe the skilful revolutions like the revolution of july are severed arteries a prompt ligature is indispensable
the right too grandly proclaimed is shaken
also right once firmly fixed the state must be strengthened
liberty once assured at tention must be directed to power
here the wages are not as yet separated from the skilful but they begin to be distrustful
power very good
but in the first place what is power
in the second whence comes it
the skilful do not seem to hear the murmured objection and they continue their manoeuvres
according to the politicians who are ingenuous i'm putting the mask of necessity on profitable fictions the first requirement of a people after a revolution when this people forms part of a monarchical continent is to procure for itself a dynasty
in this way say they peace that is today time to dress our wounds and to repair the house can be had after a revolution
the dynasty conceals the scaffolding and covers the ambulance
now it is not always easy to procure a dynasty
if it is absolutely necessary the first man of genius or even the first man of fortune who comes to hand suffices for the manufacturing of a king
you have in the first case napoleon in the second i turbo de
but the first family that comes to hand does not suffice to make a dynasty
there is necessarily requires a certain modicum of antiquity in a race and the wrinkle of the centuries can not be improvised
if we place ourselves at the point of view of the statesmen after making all allowances of course after a revolution what are the qualities of the king which result from it
he may be and it is useful for him to be a revolutionary that is to say a participant in his own person in that revolution that he should have lent a hand to it that he should have either compromised or distinguished himself therein that he should have touched the axe or wielded the sword in it
what are the qualities of a dynasty
it should be national that is to say revolutionary at a distance not through acts committed but by reason of ideas accepted
it should be composed of past and be historic be composed of future and be sympathetic
all this explains why the early revolutions contented themselves with finding a man cromwell of napoleon and why the second absolutely insisted on finding a family the house of brunswick of the house of orleans
royal houses resemble those indian fig trees each branch of which bending over to the earth takes root and becomes a big tree itself
each branch may become a dynasty
on the sole condition that it shall bend down to the people
such is the theory of the skilful
here then lies the great art to make a little render to success the sound of a catastrophe in order that those who profit by it may tremble from it also to season with fear every step that is taken to augment the curve of the transition to the point of regarding progress to dull that aurora to denounce and retrench the harshness of enthusiasm to cut all angles and nails to war triumph to muffle up right to envelop the giant people in flannel and to put it to be every speedily to impose a diet in that excess of health to put hercules on the treatment of a convalescent to dilute the event with the expedient to offer to spirits thirsting for the ideal that nectar thinned out with a lotion to take one's precautions against too much success to tarnish the revolution with a shade
practised this theory already applied to england by
is a revolution arrested midway
half of progress quasi tight
now logic knows not the almost absolutely as the sun knows not the candle
who arrests revolutions halfway
the bourgeoisie
why
because the bourgeoisie is interest which has reached satisfaction
yesterday it was appetite today it is plenitude tomorrow it will be satiety
the phenomenon of after napoleon was reproduced in after charles x
the attempt has been made and wrongly to make a class of the bourgeoisie
the bourgeoisie is simply the contented portion of the people
the bourgeoisie the man who now has time to sit down
a chair is not a caste
but through a desire to sit down too soon one may arrest the very march of the human race
this has often been the fault of the bourgeoisie
one is not a class because one has committed a fault
selfishness is not one of the divisions of the social order
moreover we must be just to selfishness
the state to which that part of the nation which is called the bourgeoisie aspired after the shock of was not the inertia which is complicated with indifference and laziness and which contains a little shame it was not the slumber which presupposes a momentary forgetfulness accessible to dreams it was the half
the half is a word formed of a singular double and almost contradictory sense a troop on the march that is to say movements stand that is to say repose
the baltic the restoration of forces it is repose armed and on the alert it is the accomplished fact which posts sentinels and holds itself on its guard
the half presupposes the combat of yesterday and the combat of tomorrow
it is the partition between and
what we he recall combat may also be designated as progress
the bourgeoisie then as well as the statesmen required a man who should express this word halt
an although because
a composite individuality signifying revolution and signifying stability in other terms strengthening the present by the evident compatibility of the past with the future
this man was already found
his name was louis philipped' orleans
the made louis philippe king
lafayette undertook the coronation
he called it the best of republics
the town hall of paris took the place of the cathedral of rheims
this substitution of a half the one for a whole throne was the work of
when the skilful had finished the immense vice of their solution became apparent
all this has been accomplished outside the bounds of absolute right
absolute right frisco protest
then terrible to say it retired into the darkness
chapter iii louis philippe revolutions have a terrible arm and a happy hand they strike firmly and choose well
even incomplete even debased and abused and reduced to the state of a junior revolution like the revolution of them nearly always retain sufficient providential lucidity to prevent them from falling amiss
their eclipse is never an abdication
nevertheless let us not boast too loudly revolutions also may be deceived and grave errors have been seen
let us return to
in its deviation has good luck
in the establishment which entitled itself order after the revolution had been cut short the king amounted to more than royalty
louis philippe was a rare nan
the son of a father to whom history will accord certain attenuating circumstances but also as worthy of esteem as that father had been of blame possessing all private virtues and many public virtues careful of his health of misfortune of his person of his affairs knowing the value of a minute and not always the value of a year sober serene peaceable patients goldman and a good prince sleeping with his wife and having in his palace lackeys charged with the duty of showing the conjugal bed to the bourgeois an ostentation of the regular sleeping apartment which had become useful after the former illegitimate displays of the elder branch knowing all the languages of europe and what is more rare all the languages of all interests and speaking them an admirable representative of the middle class but outstripping it and in every way greater than it possessing excellent sense while appreciating the blood from which he had sprung counting most of all on his intrinsic worth and on the question of his face very particular declaring himself orleans and not bourbon thoroughly the first prince of the blood royal while he was still only a serene highness but a frank bourgeois from the day he became king diffuse in public concise in private reputed but not proved to be amused at bottom one of those economi see who are readily prodigal at their own fancy or duty lettered but not very sensitive to letters a gentleman but not a chevalier simple calm and strong adored by his family and his household a fascinating talked a nun received statesman inwardly cold dominated by immediate interest always governing at the shortest range incapable of rancor and of gratitude making use without mercy of superiority in mediocrity clever in getting parliamentary majorities to put in the wrong those mysterious unani motifs which mutter fully under the ones unreserved sometimes imprudent in his lack of reserve but with marvellous address in that imprudence fertile in expedients in countenances in masks making france fear europe and europe france
incontestably fond of his country but preferring his family assuming more domination than authority and more authority than dignity a disposition which has this unfortunate property that as it turns everything to success it admits of russ and does not absolutely repudiate baseness but which has this valuable side that it preserves politics from violent shocks the state from fractures and society from catastrophes minute correct vigilant attentive sagacious indefatigable contradicting himself at times and giving himself the lie bold against austria at ancona obstinate against england in spain bombarding antwerp and paying off pritchard singing the marseillaise with conviction inaccessible to despondency to lassitude to the taste for the beautiful and the ideal for aging generosity to utopia to chimeras to wrath to vanity to fear possessing all the forms of personal intrepidity a general at valmy a soldier at me mapped attacked eight times by regi codes and always smiling
brave as a grenadier courageous as a thinker uneasy only in the face of the chances of a european shaking up and unfitted for great political adventures always ready to risk his life never his work disguising his will in influence in order that he might be obeyed as an intelligence rather than as a king endowed with observation and not with divination not very attentive to minds but knowing men that is to say requiring to see in order to judge prompt and penetrating good sense practical wisdom easy speech prodigious memory drawing incessantly on this memory his only point of resemblance with caesar alexander and napoleon knowing deeds facts details dates proper names ignorant of tendencies passions the diverse geniuses of the crowd the interior aspirations the hidden and obscure uprisings of souls in a word all that can be designated as the invisible currents of consciences accepted by the surface but little in accord with france lower down extricating himself by dint of fact governing too much and not enough his own first minister excellent at creating out of the pettiness of realities an obstacle to the immensity of ideas mingling a genuine creative faculty of civilization of order and organization an indescribable spirit of proceedings and chicanery the founder and lawyer of a dynasty having something of charlemagne and something of an attorney in short a lofty and original figures prince who understood how to create authority in spite of the uneasiness of france and power in spite of the jealousy of europe
louis philippe will be classed among the eminent men of his century and would be ranked among the most illustrious governors of history had he loved glory but a little and if he had had the sentiment of what is great to the same degree as the feeling for what is useful
louis philippe had been handsome and in his old age he remained graceful not always approved by the nation he always was so by the masses he pleaded
he had that gift of charming
he lacked majesty he wore no crown although a king and no white hair although an old man his manners belonged to the old regime and his habits to the news mixture of the noble and the bourgeois which suited louis philippe was transit jon reigning he had preserved the ancient pronunciation and the ancient orthography which he placed at the service of opinions modern he loved poland and hungary but he wrote les polonius and he pronounced les hong raid
he wore the uniform of the national guard like charles x
and the ribbon of the legion of honor like napoleon
he went a little to chapel not at all to the chase never to the opera
incorruptible by sacri standby shippers in by ballet dancers this made a part of his bourgeois popularity
he had no heart
he went out with his umbrella under his arm and this umbrella long formed a part of his aureole
he was a bit of amazon a bit of a gardener something of a doctor he blew a postilion who had tumbled from his horse louis philippe no more went about without his lancer than did henri iv
without his pinkard
the royalists jeered at this ridiculous king the first who had ever shed blood with the object of healing
for the grievances against louis philippe there is one deduction to be made there is that which accuses royalty that which accuses the reign that which accuses the king three columns which all five different totals
democratic right confiscated progress becomes a matter of secondary interest the protests of the street violently repressed military execution of insurrections the rising passed over by arms the rue trans no gain the counsels of war the absorption of the real country by the legal country in half shares with three hundred thousand privileged persons these are the deeds of royalty belgium refused algeria too harshly conquered and as in the case of india by the english with more barbarism than civilization the breach of faith to abdelkader boats deutz bought pritchard paid these are the doings of the reign the policy which was more domestic than national was the doing of the king
as will be seen the proper deduction having been made the king's charge is decreased
this is his great fault he was modest in the name of france
whence arises this fault
we will state it
louis philippe was rather too much of a paternal king that incubation of a family with the object of founding a dynasty is afraid of everything and does not like to be else he had hence excessive timidity which is displeasing to the people who have the th of july in their civil and austerlitz in their military tradition
moreover if we deduct the public duties which require to be fulfilled first of all that deep tenderness of louis philippe towards his family was deserved by the family
that domestic group was worthy of admiration
virtues there dwelt side by side with talents
one of louis philippe's daughter sharifd' orleans placed the name of her race among artists as charlesd' orleans had placed it among posts
she made of her soul a marble which she named jeanned' arc
two of louis philippe's daughters elicited from metternich this full glum they are young people such as are rarely seen and princes such as are never seen
this without any dissimulation and also without any exaggeration is the truth about louis philippe
to be prince equality to bear in his own person the contradiction of the restoration and the revolution to have that disquieting side of the revolutionary which becomes reassuring in governing power therein lay the fortune of louis philippe in never was there a more complete adaptation of a man to an event the one entered into the other and the in carnet jim took place
louis philippe is made man
moreover he had in his favor that great recommendation to the throne exile
he had been proscribed a wanderer poor
he had lived by his own labor
in switzerland this heir to the richest princely domains in france had sold an old norse in order to obtain bread
at reich ebay he gave lessons in mathematics while his sister adelaide did will work and sewer
these souvenirs connected with a king rendered the bourgeoisie enthusiastic
he had with his own hands demolished the iron cage of mont saint michel built by louis xi and used by louis xv
he was the companion of rumour is she was the friend of lafayette he had belonged to the jacobins' club mirabeau had slapped him on the shoulder canton had said to him young man
at the age of four and twenty in' being then m
de chartres he had witnessed from the depth of a box the trial of louis xvi
so well named that poor tyrant
the blind clairvoyance of the revolution breaking royalty in the king and the king with royalty do dsl almost without noticing the man in the fierce crushing of the idea the vast storm of the assembly tribunal the public wrath interrogating capet not knowing what to reply the alarming stupefied vacillation by that total head beneath that sombre breath the relative innocence of all in that catastrophe of those who condemned as well as of the man condemned he had looked on those things he had contemplated that giddiness he had seen the centuries appear before the bar of the assembly convention he had be held behind louis xvi
that unfortunate passerby who was made responsible the terrible culprit the monarchy rise through the shadows and there had lingered in his soul the respectful fear of these immense justices of the populace which are almost as impersonal as the justice of god
the trace left in him by the revolution was prodigious
its memory was like a living imprint of those great years minute by minute
one day in the presence of a witness whom we are not permitted to doubt be rectified from memory the whole of the letters in the alphabetical list of the constituent assembly
louis philippe was a king of the broad daylight
while he reigned the press was free the tribune was free conscience and speech were free
the laws of september are open to sight
although fully aware of the gnawing power of light on privileges he left his throne exposed to the light
history will do justice to him for this loyalty
louis philippe like all historical men who have passed from the scene is today put in his trial by the human conscience
his case is as yet only in the lower court
the hour when history speaks with its free and venerable accent has not yet sounded for him the moment has not come to pronounce a definite judgment on this king the austere and illustrious historian louis blanc has himself recently softened his first verdict louis philippe was elected by those two almost's which are called the and that is today by a half parliament and a half revolution and in any case from the superior point of view where philosophy must place itself we can not judge him here as the reader has seen above except with certain reservations in the name of the absolute democratic principle in the eyes of the absolute outside these two fights the right of man in the first place the right of the people in the second allis usurpation but what we can say even at the present day that after making these reserves is that god unto the whole and in whatever manner he is considered louis philippe taken in himself and from the point of view of human goodness will remain to use the antique language of ancient history one of the best princes who ever sat on a throne
what is there against him
that throne
take away louis philippe the king there remains the man
and the man is good
he is good at times even to the point of being admirable
often in the midst of his grave at souvenirs after a day of conflict with the whole diplomacy of the continent he returned at night to his apartments and there exhausted with fatigue overwhelmed with sleep what did he do
he took a death sentence and passed the night in devising a criminal suit considering it something to hold his own against europe but that it was a still greater matter to rescue a man from the executioner
he obstinately maintained his opinion against his keeper of the seals be disputed the ground with the guillotine foot my foot against the crown attorneys those charterers of the law as he called them
sometimes the pile of sentences covered his table he examined them all it was anguish to him to abandon these miserable condemned heads
one day he said to the same witness to whom we have recently referred i won seven last night
during the early years of his reign the death penalty was as good as abolished and the erection of a scaffold was's violence committed against the king
the greve having disappeared with the elder branch a bourgeois place of execution was instituted under the name of the barriers saint jacques practical men felt the necessity of a quasi legitimate guillotine and this was one of the victories of casimir peeler who represented the narrow sides of the bourgeoisie over louis philippe who represented its liberal rides
louis philippe annotated beccaria with his own hand
after the fire chi machine he exclaimed what a pity that i was not wounded
then i might have pardoned
on another occasion alluding to the resistance offered by his ministry he wrote in connection with a political criminal who is one of the most generous figures of our day his pardon is granted it only remains for me to obtain it
louis philippe was as gentle as louis ix
and as kindly as henri iv
how to our mind in history where kindness is the rarest of pearls the man who is kindly almost takes precedence of the man who is great
louis philippe having been severely judged by some harshly perhaps by others it is quite natural that a man himself a phantom at the present day who knew that king should come and testify in his favor before history this reposition whatever else it may be is evidently and above all things entirely did interested an epitaph penned by a dead man is sincere ones made may console another share the sharing of the same shadows confers the right to praise if it is not greatly to be feared that it will ever be said of two tombs in exile this one flattered the other
chapter iv cracks beneath the foundation at the moment when the drama which we are narrating is on the point of penetrating into the depths of one of the tragic clouds which envelop the beginning of louis philippe's reign it was necessary that there should be no equiv o que and it became requisite that this book should offer some explanation with regard to this king
louis philippe had entered into possession of his royal authority without violence without any direct action of his part by virtue of a revolutionary change evidently quite distinct from the real aim of the revolution but in which he the ducd' orleans exercised no personal initiative
he had been born a prince and he believed himself to have been elected king
he had not served this mandate on himself he had not taken if it had been offered to him and he had accepted it convinced wrongly to be sure but convinced nevertheless that the order was in accordance with right and that the acceptance of it was in accordance with duty
hence his possession was in good faith
now we say it in good conscience louis philippe being in possession in perfect good faith and the democracy being in good faith in its attack the amount of terror discharged by the social conflicts weighs neither on the king not on the democracy
a clash of principles resembles a clash of elements
the ocean defends the water the hurricane defends the air the king defends royalty the democracy defends the people the relative which is the monarchy resists the absolute which is there publis society bleeds in this conflict but that which constitutes it's suffering today will constitute its safety later on and in any case those who combat are not to be blamed one of the two parties is evidently mistaken the right is not like the colossus of rhodes on two stores at once with one foot on the republican done in royalty it is indivisible and all on one side but those who are in error are so sincerely a blind man is no more a criminal than ave n dean is a ruffian
let us then impute to the fatality of things alone these formidable collisions
whatever the nature of these tempests may be human or responsibility is mingled with them
let us complete this exposition
the government of led a hard life immediately
born yesterday it was obliged to fight today
hardly installed it was already everywhere conscious of vague movements of traction on the apparatus of july so recently laid and so lacking in solidity
resistance was born on the morrow perhaps even it was born in the preceding evening
from month to month the hostility increases and from being concealed it became patent
the revolution of july which gained but little acceptance outside of france by kings had been diversely interpreted in france as we have said
god delivers over to menu is visible will in events an obscure text written in a mysterious tongue
men immediate it make translations of it translations nasty incorrect full of errors of gaps and of nonsense
very few minds comprehend the divine language
the most sagacious the calmest the most profound decipher slowly and when they arrive with their test the task has long been completed there are already twenty translations on the public place
from each remaining springs a party and from each his interpretation a faction and each party thinks that it alone has the true text and each faction thinks that it possesses the light
power itself is often a faction
there are in revolutions swimmers who go against the current they are the old parties
for the old parties who cling to heredity by the grace of god think that revolutions having sprung from the right to revolt one has the right to revolt against them
error
for in these revolutions the one who revolts is not the people it is the king
revolution is precisely the contrary of revolt
every revolution being a normal outcome contains within itself its legitimacy which false revolutionists sometimes dishonor but which remains even when soiled which survives even when stained with blood
revolutions spring not from an accident but from necessity
a revolution is a return from the fictitious to the real
it is because it must be that it is
nonetheless did the old legiti most parties assail the revolution of with all the vehemence which arises from false reasoning
errors make excellent projectiles
they strike in cleverly in its vulnerable spot in default of a cuirass in its lack of logic they attacked this revolution in its royalty
they shouted to it revolution why this king
factions are blind men who aim correctly
this cry was uttered equally by the republicans
but coming from them this cry was logical
what was blindness in the us go to mists was clearness of vision in the democrats
had bankrupted the people
the enraged democracy reproached it with this
between the attack of the past and the attack of the future the establishment of july struggled
it represented the minute at loggerheads on the one hand with the monarchical centuries on the other hand with eternal right
in addition and beside all this as it was no longer revolution and had become a monarchy was obliged to take precedence of all europe
to keep the peace was an increase of complication
a harmony established contrary to sense is often more onerous than a war
from this secret conflict always muzzled but always growling was born armed peace that ruinous expedient of civilization which in the madness of the european cabinets is suspicious in itself
the royalty of july reared up in spite of the fact that it caught it in the harness of european cabinets
metternich would gladly have put it in kicking straps
pushed on in france by progress it pushed on the monarchies those loitered's in europe
after having been towed it undertook to tow
meanwhile within her pauperis'm the proletariat salary education penal servitude prostitution the fate of the woman wealth misery production consumption division exchange coin credit the rights of capital the rights of labor all these questions were multiplied above society a terrible slope
outside of political parties properly so called another movement became manifest
philosophical fermentation replied to democratic fermentation
the elect felt troubled as well as the masses in another manner but quite as much
thinkers meditated while the soil that is to say the people traversed by revolutionary currents trembled under them with indescribably vague epileptic shocks
these dreamers some isolated others united in families and almost in communion turned over social questions in a pacific but profound manner impassive miners who tranquilly pushed their galleries into the depths of a volcano hardly disturbed by the full commotion and the furnace for which they caught glimpses
this tranquillity was not the least beautiful spectacle of this agitated epoch
these men left to political parties the question of rights they occupied themselves with the question of happiness
the wellbeing of man that was what they wanted to extract from society
they raised material questions questions of agriculture of industry of commerce almost to the dignity of a religion
in civilization such as it has formed itself a little by the command of god a great deal by the agency of man interests combine unite and amalgamate in a manner to form a veritable hard rock in accordance with a dynamic law patiently studied by economists those geologists of politics
these men who grouped themselves under different appellations but who may all be designated by the generic title of socialists endeavored to pierce that rock and to cause it to spout forth the living waters of human felicity
from the question of the scaffold to the question of war their works embraced everything
to the rights of man as proclaimed by the french revolution they added the rights of woman and the rights of the child
the reader will not be surprised if for various reasons we do not be retreat in a thorough manner from the theoretical point of view the questions raised by socialism
we confine ourselves to indicating the m
all the problems that the socialists proposes to themselves cow moronic visions revert and mysticism being cast aside can be reduced to two principal problems
first problem to produce wealth
second problem to share it
the first problem contains the question of work
the second contains the question of salary
in the first problem the employment of forces is in question
in the second the distribution of enjoyment
from the proper employment of force z results public power
from a good distribution of enjoyments results individual happiness
by a good distribution not an equal but an equitable distribution must be understood
from these two things combined the public power without individual happiness within results social prosperity
social prosperity means the man happy the citizen free the nation great
england solves the first of these two problems
she creates wealth admirably she divides it badly
this solution which is complete in one side only leads her fatally to two extremes monstrous opulence monstrous wretchedness
all enjoyments for some all privations for the rest that is to say for the people privilege exception monopoly feudalism born front oil itself
a false and dangerous situation which dates public power or private misery which sets the roots of the state in the sufferings of the individual
a badly constituted grandeur in which are combined all the material elements and into which no moral element enters
communism and agrarian law think that they solve the second problem
they are mistaken
their division kills production
equal partition abolished emulation and consequently labor
it is a partition made by the butcher which kills that which it divides
it is therefore impossible to pause over these pretended solutions
slaying wealth is not the same thing as dividing it
the two problems require to be solved together to be well solved
the two problems must be combined and made but one
solve only the first of the two problems you will be venice you will be england
you will have ii of venice an artificial power or like england a material power you will be the wicked richman
you will die by an act of violence as venice died or by bankruptcy as england will fall
and the world will allow to die and fall all that is merely selfishness all that does not represent for the human race either a virtue of an idea
it is well understood here that by the words venice england we designate not the peoples but social structures the oligarchies superposed on nations and not the nations themselves
the nation's always have our respect and our sympathy
venice as a people will live again england the aristocracy will fall buy england the nation is immortal
that said we continue
solve the two problems encourage the wealthy and protect the poor suppress misery put an end to the unjust farming out of the feeble by the strong put a bridle in the iniquitous jealousy of the man who is making his way against the man who has reached the goal adjust mathematically and fraternally salary to labor mingle gratuitous and compulsory education with the growth of childhood and make of science the base of manliness develop minds while keeping arms bush beat one and the same time a powerful people and a family of happy men render property democratic not by abolishing it but by making it universal so that every citizen without exception may be a proprietor an easier matter than is generally supposed in two words learn how to produce wealth and how to distribute it and you will have at once moral and material greatness and you will be worthy to call yourself france
this is what socialism said outside and above a few eects which have gone astray that is what it sought in facts that is what it sketched out in mind's
efforts worthy of admiration
sacred attempts
these doctrines these theories these resistances the unforeseen necessity for the statesman to take philosophers into account confused evidences of which we catch a glimpse a new system of politics to be created which shall be in accord with the old world without too much did accord with the new revolutionary idea la situation in which it became necessary to use lafayette to defend poling as the intuition of progress transparent beneath the revolt the chambers and streets the competitions to be brought into equilibrium around him his faith in the revolution perhaps an eventual indefinable resignation born of the vague acceptance of a superior definitive right his desire to retain of his face his domestic spirit his sincere respect for the people his own honesty preoccupied louis philippe almost painfully and there were moments when strong and courageous as he was he was overwhelmed by the difficulties of being a king
he felt under his feet a formidable disaggregation which was not nevertheless a reduction to dust france being more france than ever
piles of shadows covered the horizon
a strange shade gradually drawing nearer extended little by little over hanover things over idea was made which came from deaths and systems
everything which had been hastily stifled was moving and fermenting
at times the conscience of the honest man resumed its breathing so great was the discomfort of that air in which sophie ms were intermingled with truths
spirits trembled in the social anxiety like leaves at the approach of a storm
the electric tension was such that at certain instants the first comer a stranger brought light
then the twilight obscurity closed in again
at intervals deep and full mutterings allowed a judgment to be formed as to the quantity of thunder contained by the cloud
twenty months had barely elapsed since the revolution of july the year had opened with an aspect of something impending and threatening
the distress of the people the laborers without b read the last prince seconds engulfed in the shadows brussels expelling the nassau was paris did the bourbons belgium offering herself to a french prince and giving herself to an english prince the russian hatred of nicolas behind us the demons of the south ferdinand in spain miguel in portugal the earth quaking in italy metternich extending his hand over bologna france treating austria sharply at ancona at the north no one knew what sinister sound of the hammer mailing up poland in her coffin irritated glances watching france narrowly all over europe england a suspect really ready to give a push to that which was tottering and to hurl herself on that which should call the peerage sheltering itself behind beccaria to refuse four heads to the law the fleurs de lys erased from the king's carriage the cross torn from notre dame lafayette lessened laffitte ruined benjamin constant dead in indigence casimir peeler dead in the exhaustion of his power political and social malady breaking out simultaneously in the two capitals of the kingdom the one in the city of thought the other in the city of toil at paris civil war at lyons servile war in the two cities the same glare of the furnace a crater like crimson on the brow of the people the south rendered fanatic the west troubled the duchesse de berry in lavender plots conspiracies rising's cholera added the sombre roar of tumult of events to the sombre roar of ideas
chapter v facts whence history springs and which history ignores towards the end of april everything had become aggravated
the fermentation entered the boiling state
ever since petty partial revolts had been going on here and there which were quickly suppressed but ever bursting forth a fresh the sign of a vast underlying conflagration
something terrible was in preparation
glimpses could be caught of the features still in distinct and i'm perfectly lighted of a possible revolution
france kept an eye on paris paris kept an eye on the faubourg saint antoine
the faubourg saint antoine which was in a will glow was beginning its ebullition
illustrations street orator be free to eat or the wine shops of the tue dec garonne were although the union of the two epithets seems singular when applied to wine shops grave and stormy
the government was there purely and simply called in question
there people publicly discussed the question of fighting or of keeping quiet
there were back shops where working men were made to swear that they would hasten into the street at the first cry of alarm and that they would fight without counting the number of the enemy
this engagement once entered into a man seated in the corner of the wine shop assumed a sonorous to be and said you understand
you have sworn
sometimes they went upstairs to a private room on the first floor and there scenes that were almost masonic were enacted
they made the initiated take paths to render service to himself as well as to the fathers of families
that was the formula
in the two rooms subversive pamphlets were read
they treated the government with contempt days a secret report of that time
words like the following could be heard there idon't know the names of the leaders
we folks shall not know the day until two hours before hand
one workman said there are three hundred of islet each contribute tendons that will make one hundred and fifty france with which to procure powder and shot
another said idon't ask for six months idon't ask for even two
in less than a fortnight we shall be parallel with the government
with twenty five thousand men we can face them
another said idon't sleep at night because i make cartridges all night
from time to time men of bourgeois appearance and in good costs came and caused embarrassment and with the air of command shook hands with the most important and then went away
they never stayed more than ten minutes
sign if i want remarks were exchanged in a low bone the plot is ripe the matter is arranged
it was murmured by all who were there to borrow the very expression of one of those who were present
the exaltation was such that one day a working man exclaimed before the whole wine shop we have no arms
one of his comrades replied the soldiers have
this parodying without being aware of the fact bonaparte's proclamation to the army in italy when they had anything of a more secret nature on hand adds one report they did not communicate it to each other
it is not easy to understand what they could conceal after what they said
these reunions were sometimes periodical
at certain ones of them there were never more than eight or ten persons present and they were always the same
i mothers anyone entered who wishes and the room was so full that they were forced to stand
some went thither through enthusiasm and passion others because it was in their way to their work
as during the revolution there were patriotic women in some of these wine shops who embraced newcomers
other expressive facts came to light
a man would enter a shop drink and to go away with the remark wine merchant the revolution will pay what is due to you
revolutionary agents were appointed in a wine shop facing the tue dec garonne
the balloting was carried on in their caps
working men met at the house of a fencing master who gave lessons in the rue de corte
there there was atrophy of arms formed of wooden broad sword scans's clubs and tools
one day the buttons were removed from the tools
's work man said there are twenty five of us but theydon't count on me because i am looked upon as a machine
later on that machine became que gusset
the indefinite things which were brewing gradually acquired a strange and indescribable notoriety
a woman sweeping off her footsteps said to another woman for a long time there has been a strong force busy making cartridges
in the open street proclamation could be seen addressed to the national guard in the departments
one of these proclamations was signed burt of wine merchant
one day a man with his beard worn like a collar and with an italian accent mounted a stone post at the door of a liquor seller on the marche lenoir and read aloud a singular document which seemed to emanate from an occult power
groups formed around him and applauded
the passages which touched the crowd most deeply were collected and noted down
our doctrines are trammell ed our proclamation storm our bills tickets are spied upon and thrown into prison
the breakdown which has recently taken place in cottons has converted to us many mediums
the future of nations is being worked out in our obscure banks
here are the fixed terms action or reaction revolution or counter revolution
for a tour epoch we no longer believe either in inertia or in immobility
for the people against the people that is the question
there is no other
on the day when we cease to suit you break usb it up to that day help us to march on
all this in broad daylight
other deeds more audacious still were suspicious in the eyes of the people by reason of their very audacity
ont meth of april a passerby mounted the post on the corner which forms the angle of the rue saint e marguerite and shouted i am sba bouvier
but beneath babe if the people scented bosquet
among other things this man said down with property
the opposition of the left is cowardly and treacherous
when it wants to be on the right side it preaches revolution it is democratic in order to escape being beaten and royalist so that it may not have to fight
the republicans are beasts with feathers
distrust the republicans citizen for the laboring classes
silence citizens oy
cried an artisan
this shout out an end to the discourse
mysterious incidents occurred
at nightfall a working man encountered near the canal a very well dressed man who said to him whither are you found citizen
sig replied the working man i have not the honor of your acquaintance
i know you very well however
and the man addeddon't be alarmed i am an agent of the committee
you are suspected of not being quite faithful
you know that if you reveal anything there is an eye fixed on you
then he shook hands with the working man and went away saying we shall meet again soon
the police who were on the alert collected singular dialogues not only in the wine shops but in the street
get yourself received very soon said a weaver to a cabinet maker
why
there is going to be a shot to fire
two ragged pedestrians exchanged these remarkable replies fraught with evident jacque die who governs us
m
philippe
no it is the bourgeoisie
the reader is mistaken if he thinks that we take the word jacque die in an adsense
the jacques were the poor
on another occasion two men were heard today to each other as they passed by we have a good plan of attack
only the following was caught of a private conversation between four men who were crouching in a ditch of the circle of the barrier edit done everything possible will be done to prevent his walking about paris any more
who was theme
menacing obscurity
the principal leaders as they said in the faubourg held themselves apart
it was supposed that they met for consultation in a wine shop near the point saint eustache
a certain aug chief of the society aid for tailors the monde your had the reputation of serving as intermediary central between the leaders and the faubourg saint antoine
nevertheless there was always a great deal of mystery about these leaders and no certain facts an invalidate the singular arrogance of this reply made later on by a man accused before the court of peers who was your leader
i knew of bone and i recognized none
there was nothing but words transparent but vague sometimes idle reports rumors hearsay
other indications cropped up
a carpenter occupied in mailing boards to a fence around the ground on which a house was in process of construction in the rue de re hilly found on that plot the torn fragment of a letter on which were still legible the following lines the committee must take measures to prevent recruiting in the sections for the different societies
and as a postscript we have learned that there are guns in the rue du faubourg poisson nie reno
b is to the number of five or six thousand in the house of a gunsmith in that court
the section owns no arms
what excites the carpenter and caused him to show this thing to his neighbors was the fact that a few paces further on he picked up another paper torn like the first and still more significant of which were produce a facsimile because of the historical interest attaching to these strange documents illustration code table b pages cds learn this list by heart
after so doing you will tear it up

it was only later on that the persons who were in the secret of this fund at the time learned the significance of those four capital letters quin tutions centurions securi once claire its scouts and the sense of the letter who gave which was a date and meant april th

the honest bourgeois into whose hands this list fell knew its significance
it appears that this list was the complete nomenclature of the sections of the fourth at one is cement of the society of the rights of man with the names and dwellings of the chiefs of sections
today when all these facts which were obscure are nothing more than history we may publish the k
it should be added that the foundation of the society of the rights of man seems to have been posterior to the date when this paper was found
perhaps this was only a rough draft
still according to all the remarks and the words according to written notes material facts begin to make their appearance
in the rue pop in court in the house of a dealer in bric a brac there were seized seven sheets or gray paper all folders like lengthwise and in four these sheets enclosed twenty six squares of this same gray paper folder in the form of a cartridge and a card on which was written the following salt petre

the report of the seizure stated that the drawer exhaled a strong smell of powder
amazon returning from his day's work left behind him a little package on a bench hear the fridge of austerlitz
this package was taken to the police station
it was opened and in it were found two printed dialogues signed lanai tierra song entitled workmen band together and a tin box full of cartridges
one artisan drinking with a comrade made the latter feel him to see how warm he was the other man felt a pistol under his waistcoat
in a ditch on the boulevard between pere lachaise and the barrier edit done at the most deserted spot some children while playing discovered beneath a mass of shavings and refuse bits of woods bag containing a bullet mould a wooden punch for the preparation of cartridges a wooden bowl in which there were grains of hunting powder and a little cast iron pot whose interior presented evident traces of melted lead
police agents making their way suddenly and unexpectedly at fiveo'clock in the morning into the dwelling of a certain patron who was afterwards a member of the barricade merry section and got himself killed in the insurrection of april found him standing near his bed and holding in his handsome cartridges which he was in the act of preparing
towards the hour when working men repost two men were seen to meet between the barrier epic pus and the barriers charenton in a little lane between two walls years wine shop in front of which there was a heures i am
one drew a pistol from beneath his blouse and handed it to the other
as he was handing it to him he noticed that the perspiration of his chest had made the powder camp
be primed the pistol and added more powder to what was already in the pan
then they women parted
a certain falls is afterwards killed in the rue beaubourg in the affair of april boasted of having in his house seven hundred cartridges and twenty four flints
the government one day received a warning that arms and two hundred thousand cartridges had just been distributed in the faubourg
on the following week thirty thousand cartridges were distributed
the remarkable point about it was that the police were not able to seize a single one
an intercepted letterhead the day is not far distant when within four hours by the clock eighty thousand patriots will be under arms
all this fermentation was public one might almost say tranquil
the approaching insurrection was preparing its storm calmly in the face of the government
no singularity was lacking to this still subterranean crisis which was already perceptible
the bourgeois talked peaceably to the working classes of what was in preparation
they said how is the rising coming along
in the same time in which they would have said how is your wife
a furniture dealer of the rue moreau inquired well when are you going to make the attack
another shopkeeper said the attack will be made soon
i know it
a month ago there were fifteen thousand of you now there are twenty five thousand
he offered his gun and an doth not offered as mail pistol which he was willing to sell for seven france
moreover the revolutionary fever was growing
not a point in paris not in france was exempt from it
the artery was beating everywhere
like those membranes which arise from certain inflammations and form in the human body the network of secret societies began to spread all over the country
from the associations of the friends of the people which was at the same time public and secret sprang the society of the rights of man which also dated from one of the orders of the day plug lose year of the republican era which was destined to survive even the mandate of the court of assizes which pronounced its dissolution and which did not hesitate to bestow on its sections significant names like the following pikes
tics in
signal cannon
phrygian cap
january
the beggars
the vagabonds
forward march
robespierre
level
fairs
the society of the rights of man engendered the society of action
these were impatient individuals who broke away and hastened ahead
other associations sought to recruit themselves from the great mother societies
the members of sections complained that they were torn asunder
thus the gallic society and the committee of organization of the municipalities
thus the associations for the liberty of the press for individual liberty for the instruction of the people against indirect taxes
then the society of equal working men which was divided into three fractions the levellers the communists the reformers
then the army of the bastille's a sort of cohort organized on a military footing four men commanded by a corporal ten by a sergeant twenty bias in lieutenant forth by a lieutenant there were never more than five men who knew each other
creation where precaution is combined with audacity and which seemed stamped with the genius of venice
the central committee which was at the head had two arms the society of action and the army of the bastille s
a legit i must association the chevaliers of fidelity stirred about among these the republican affiliations
it was denounced and repudiated there
the parisian societies had ramifications in the principal cities lyons nantes lille marseille's and each had its society of the rights of man the char bonnie re and the free men
all had a revolutionary society which was called the coin purse
we have already mentioned this word
in paris the faubourg saint marceau kept up an equal buzzing with the faubourg saint antoine and the schools were no less moved than the faubourg s
a cafe in the rue saint hyacinthe and the wine shop of the seven billiards rue des math urine saint jacques served as rallying points for the students
the society of the friends of the abc affiliated to the mutualist so dangers and to the coin purse of six met as we have seen in the cafe husain
these same young men assembled also as we have stated already in a restaurant wine shop of the rue monde tour which was called for in the
these meetings were secret
others were as public as possible and the reader can judge of their boldness from these fragments of an interrogatory undergone in one of the ulterior prosecutions where was this meeting held
in the rue de la paix
at whose house
in the street
what sections were there

you are too young to have decided alone upon the golf course of attacking the government
where did your instructions come from
from the central committee
the army was mined at the same time as the population as was proved subsequently by the operations of before lineville and e pinard
they counted on the fifty second regiment of the fifth on the eighth on the thirty seventh and on the twentieth light cavalry
in burgundy and in the southern towns they planted the liberty tree that is to say apple surmounted by a red cap
such was the situation
the faubourg saint antoine more than any other group of the population as we stated in the beginning accentuated this situation and made it felt
that was the sore point
this old faubourg people'd like an ant hill laborious courageous and angry as a hive of beeswax quivering with expectation and with the desire for a tumult
everything was in a state of agitation there without any interruption however of the regular work
it is impossible to convey an idea of this lively yet sombre physiognomy
in this faubourg exists poignant distress hidden under attic roofs there also exist rare and ardent minds
it is particularly in the matter of distress and intelligence that it is danger kms to have extreme sheet
the faubourg saint antoine had also other causes to tremble for it received the counter shock of commercial crises of failures strikes slack seasons all inherent to great political disturbances
in times of revolution misery is both cause and effect
the flow which it deals rebounds upon it
this population full of proud virtue capable to the highest degree of latent heat always ready to fly to arms prompt to explode irritated deep undermined seemed to be only awaiting the fall of a spark
whenever certain sparks float on the horizon chased by the wind of events it is impossible not to think of the faubourg saint antoine and of the formidable chance which has placed at the very gates of paris that powder house of suffering and ideas
the wine shops of the faubourg antoine which have been more than once drawn in the sketches which the reader has just perused possess historical notoriety
in troy books times people grow intoxicated there more on words than on wine
a sort of prophetic spirit and an ad flatus of the future circulates there swelling hearts and enlarging souls
the cabarets of the faubourg saint antoine resemble those taverns of hong aventine erected on the wave of the sibyl and communicating with the profound and sacred breath taber me where the tables were almost tripods and where was drunk what en mi us calls the sibyl line wine
the faubourg saint antoine is a reservoir of people
revolutionary agitations create fissures there through which trickled the popular sovereignty
this sovereignty may do evil it can be mistaken like any other but even when led astray it remains great
we may say if it as of the blind cyclops in gene
in' according as the idea which was floating about was good or evil according as it was the day of fanaticism or of enthusiasm there leaped forth from the faubourg saint antoine now savage legions now heroic bands
savage
let us explain this word
when these bristling men who in the early days of the revolutionary chaps tattered howling wolf with uplifted bludgeon like on high hurled themselves upon ancient paris in an uproar what did they want
they wanted an end to oppression an end to tyranny an end to the sword work for men instruction for the child social sweetness for the woman liberty equality fraternity bread for all the idea for all the eden izing of the world
progress and that holy sweet and good thing progress they claimed in terrible wise driven to extremities as they were half naked club in vista road in their mouths
they were savage sues but the savages of civilization
they proclaimed right furiously they were desirous of only with fear and trembling to force the human race to paradise
they seemed barbarians and they were saviours
they demanded light with the mask of night
facing these men who were ferocious we admit and terrifying bit ferocious and terrifying for good ends there are other men smiling embroidered gilded be ribbon ed starred in silk stockings in white plumes in yellow gloves unvarnished shoes who with the new knows on a velvet table beside a marble chimney piece insist gently on demeanor and the preservation of the past of the middle ages of divine right of fanaticism of innocence of slavery of the death penalty of war glorifying in low tones and with politeness the sword the stake and the scaffold
for our part if we were forced to make a choice between the barbarians of civilization and the civilized men of barbarism we should choose the barbarians
but thank heaven still another choice is possible
no perpendicular fall is necessary in front any more than in the rear
neither despotism not terrorism
we desire progress with a gentle slope
god takes care of that
god's whole look cj consists in rendering slopes less steep
chapter vi enjoi gas and his lieutenants it was about this epoch that em hold as in view of a possible catastrophe instituted a kind of mysterious census
all were present at a secret meeting at the cafe husain
em hold as said mixing his words with a few half enigmatic al but significant metaphors it is proper that we should know where we stand and on whom we may count
if combatants are required they must be provided
it can do no harm to have something with which to strike
passersby always have more chance of being bored when there are bulls in the road than when there are none
let us therefore reckon a little on the herd
how many of us are there
there is no question of postponing this task until tomorrow
revolutionists should always be hurried progress has no time to lose
let us mistrust the unexpected
let us not be caught by prepared
we just go over all the seams that we have made and see whether they hold fast

they are an enthusiastic family but liable to cool off
idon't know what has been the matter with them for some time past
they are thinking of something else
they are becoming extinguished
they pass their time playing dominoes
there is urgent need that someone should go and talk with them a little bit with firmness
they meet at richer eu's
they are to be found there between twelve and oneo'clock

a quarter of an hour later the backroom of the cafe husain was deserted

perhaps the moment was at hand
the people were again taking possession of right and what a fine spectacle
the revolution was again majestically taking possession of france and saying to the world the sequel tomorrow

book second
ep on one chapter i. the lark's meadow marius had witnessed the unexpected termination of the ambush upon whose track he had set javert but javert had no sooner quitted the building bearing of this prisoners in three hackney coaches than marius also glided out of the house
it was only nineo'clock in the evening
marius betook himself to source trac
source year was no longer the imperturbable inhabitant of the latin quarter he had gone to live in the rue de la cert chief of political reasons this quarter was one where at that epoch insurrection liked to install itself
marius said to source track have come to sleep with you
court by rac dragged a mattress off his bed which was furnished with two spread it out on the floor and said there
at seveno'clock on the following morning marius returned to the novel paid the quarter's rent which he owed toma'am bouton had his books his bed his table his commode and his two chairs loaded on a hand fart and went off without leaving his address so that when javert returned in the course of the morning for the purpose of questioning marius as to the events of the preceding evening he found onlyma'am bouton who answered moved away
ma'am bouton was convinced that marius was to some extent an accomplice of the robbers who had been seized the night before
who would ever have said it
she exclaimed to the port geddes of the quarter a young man like that who had the air of a girl
marius had two reasons for this prompt change of residence
the first was that he now had a horror of that house where he had be held so close at hand and in its most repulsive and most ferocious developments social deformity which is perhaps even more ten bible than the wicked richman the wicked poorman
the second was that he did not wish to figure in the lawsuit which would incur in all probability and be brought into testify against the barrier
javert thought that the young man whose name he had forgotten was afraid and had fled or perhaps had not even returned home at the time of the ambush he made some efforts to find him however but without success
a month passed then another
marius was still with source trac
he had learned from a young licentiate in las an habitual frequented of the courts that the barrier was in close confinement
every monday marius had five france handed into the clerk's office of la force for the barrier
as marius had no longer any money he borrowed the five france from source trac
it was the first time in his life that he had ever borrowed money
these periodical five france were a double riddle to cour de grace moment and to the barrier who received them
to whom can they go
thought source year
whence can this some time
the barrier asked himself
moreover marius was heartbroken
everything had plunged through a trap door once more
he no longer saw anything before him his life was again buried in mystery where he wandered fumbling ly
he had got a moment be held very close at hand in that obscurity the young girl whom he loved the old man who seemed to be her father those unknown beings who were his only interest and his only hope in this world and at the very moment when he thought himself on the point of grasping the marist had swept all these shadows away
not a spark of certainty and truth had been emitted even in the most terrible of collisions
no conjecture was possible
he no longer knew even the name that he thought he knew
it certainly was no turquie
and the park was a nickname
and what was hey i think of the old man
was he actually in hiding from the police
the white haired work man whom marius had encountered in the vicinity of the invalides recurred to his mind
it now seemed probable that that working man and m
leblanc were one and the same person
some disguised himself
that man had his heroic and his equivocal sides
why had he not called for help
why had he died
waste of waste not the father of the young girl
waste in short the man whom the barrier thought that he recognized
the barrier might have been mistaken
these formed so many insoluble problems
all this it is true detracted nothing from the angelic charms of the young girl of the luxembourg
heartrending distress marius bore a passion in his heart and night over his eyes
he was thrust onward he was drawn and he could not stir
all had vanished save love
of love itself he had lost the instincts and the sudden illuminations
ordinarily this flame which burns us lights is also a little and casts some useful gleams without
but marius no longer even heard these mute counsels of passion
he never said to himself what if i were to go to such a place
what if i were to try such and such a thing
the girl whom he could no longer call it duke was evidently somewhere nothing warned marius in what direction he should seek her
his whole life was now summed up in two words absolute uncertainty within an impenetrable for
to see her once again he still aspired to this but he no longer expected it
to crown all his poverty had returned
he felt that icy breath close to him on his heels
in the midst of his torments and long before this he had discontinued his work and nothing is more dangerous than discontinued work it is a habit which vanishes
a habit which is easy to get rid of and difficult to take up again
a certain amount of dreaming is good like a narcotic indiscreet doses
it pulls to sleep the fevers of the mind at labor which are sometimes severe and produces in the spirits soft and fresh vapor which corrects the over march contours of pure thought fills in gaps here and there binds together and rounds off the angles of the ideas
but too much dreaming sinks and crowns
woe to the brain worker who allows himself to fall entirely from thought into be very
he thinks that he can're a scene with equal ease and he tells himself that after all it is the same thing
error
thought is the tool of the intelligencer every its voluptuousness
to replace thought with're very is to confound allison with a good
marius had begun in that way as the reader will remember
passion had super genes and had finished the work of precipitating him into chimaera's without object or bottom
one no longer emerges from one's self except for the purpose of going off to dream
idle production
tumultuous and stagnant gulf
and in proportion as labor diminishes needs increase
this is a lad
man in a state of're very is generally prodigal and slack the unstrung mind can not hold life within close bounds
there is in that mode of life good mingled with evil for i denervation is baleful generosity is food and healthful
but the poor man who is generous and noble and who does not work is lost
resources are exhausted needs crop up
fatal declivity down which the most honest and the firmest as well as the most feeble and most vicious are drawn and which ends in one of two holds suicide of crime
by dint of going outdoors to think the day comes when one goes out to throw one's self in the water
excess of're very breeds men like esco used and letras
marine was descending this declivity at a slow pace with his eyes fixed on the girl whom he no longer saw
what we have just written seems strange and yet it is true
the memory of an absent being mind les in the darkness of the heart the more it has disappeared the more it beams the gloomy and despairing soul sees this light on its horizon the star of the inner night
she that was marius' whole thought
he hesitated of nothing else he was confusedly conscious that his old coat was becoming an impossible cost and that his new coat was growing old that his shirts were wearing out that his hat was wearing out that his boots were giving out and he said to himself if i could but see her once again before i die
one sweet idea alone was left to him that she had loved him that her glance had told him so that she did not know his name but that she did know his soul and that wherever she was however mysterious the place she still loved him perhaps
who knows whether she were not thinking of him as he was thinking of her
sometimes in those inexplicable hours such as are experienced by every heart that loves though he had no reasons for anything but sadness and her belt an obscure quiver of joy he said to himself it is her thoughts that are coming home
then he added perhaps my thoughts reach her also
this illusion at which he shook his head a moment later was sufficient nevertheless to throw beams which at times resembled hope into his soul
from time to time especially at that evening tour which is the most depressing to even the dream the allowed the purest the most impersonal the most ideal of the reveries which filled his brain to fall upon's notebook which contained nothing else
he called this writing to her
it must not be supposed that his reason was deranged
suite the contrary
he had lost the faculty of working and of moving firmly towards any fixed goal but he was endowed with more clear sightedness and rectitude than ever
marius surveyed by a calm and real although peculiar light what passed before his eyes even the most in different deeds and msn he pronounced a just criticism on everything with a sort of honest rejection and candid disinterested news
his judgment which was almost wholly disassociated from hope held itself aloof and soared in high
in this state of mind nothing escaped him nothing deceived him and every moment he was discovering the foundation of life of humanity and of destiny
happy even in the midst of anguish is me to whom god has given a soul worthy of love and of unhappiness
he who has not viewed the things of this world and the heart of man under this double light has seen nothing and knows nothing of the true
the soul which lives and suffers is in a state of sublimity
however day followed day and nothing new presented itself
it merely seemed to him that the sombre space which still remained to be traversed by him was growing shorter with every instant
he thought that he already distinctly perceived the brink of the bottomless abyss
what
he repeated to himself shall i not see her again before then
when you have ascended the rue saint jacques left the barrier on one side and followed the old inner boulevard for some distance you reach the rue de la sante then the glaciers and a little while before arriving at the little river of the gobelins you come to a sort of field which is the only spot in the long and monotonous chain of the boulevards of paris where guys feel would be tempted to sit down
there is something indescribable there which exhales grace a. green meadow traversed by tightly stretched lines from which flutter tags drying in the wind and an old market gardener's house built in the time of louis xiii
with its great roof oddly pierced with dormer windows dilapidated palisades a little water amid poplar trees women voice slaughter on the horizon the pantheon the pole of the deaf mutes the calder race black squat fantastic amusing magnificent and in the background the severe square crests of the towers of notre dame
as the place is worth looking at no one goes thither
hardly one cart or wagoner passes in a quarter of an hour
it chanced that marius' solitary strolls led him to this plot of ground near the water
that day there was a rarity in the boulevard a passerby
marius vaguely impressed with the almost savage beauty of the place asked this passerby what is the name of this spot
the person replied it is the lark's meadow
and he added it was here that up bach killed the shepherdess of ivey
but after the word park marius heard nothing more
these sudden congeal ments in the state of're very which a single word suffices to evoke do occur
the entire thought is abruptly condensed around an idea and it is no longer capable of perceiving anything else
the park was the appellation which had replaced its klein the depths of marius' melancholy
shop said he with a sort of unreasoning stupor peculiar to these mysterious asides this is her meadow
i shall know where she loves now
it was absurd but irresistible
and every day he returned to that meadow of the park
chapter ii embryonic formation of crimes in the incubation of prisons have rt's triumph in the gorge au novel seemed complete but had not been so
in the first place and this constituted the principal anxiety javert had not taken the prisoner prisoner
the assassinated man who flees is more suspicious than the assassin and it is probable that this person age who had been so precious a capture for the ruffians would be no less find a prize for the authorities
and then montparnasse had escaped javert
another opportunity of laying hands on that devil's candy must be waited for
montparnasse had in fact encountered epo mind as she stood on the watch under the trees of the boulevard and had led her off preferring to play be morin with the daughter rather than sch under hannes with the father
it was well that he did so
he was free
a store po nine javert has caused her to be seized a mediocre consolation
epp nine had joined a selma at les made lone tree
and finally on the way from the gorge au house to la force one of the principal prisoners clashes ous had been lost
it was not known how this has been effected the police agents and the sergeants could not understand it at all
he had converted himself into vapor he had slipped through the handcuffs he has trickled through the crevices of the carriage the disc re was cracked and he had fled all that they were able today was that on arriving at the prison there was no clash espys
either the fairies of the police had had a man digit
marc la que so is melted into the shadows like a snowflake in water
had there been in avowed connivance of the police agents
did this may belong to the double enigma of order and disorder
waste concentric with infraction and repression
had this sphinx his fore laws in crimean shifting laws in authority
javert did not accept such con mi nations and would have bristled up against such compromises but his squad included other inspectors besides himself who were more initiated than he perhaps although they were his subordinates in the secrets of the prefecture and clashes ous had been such a villain that he might make a very good agent
it is an excellent thing for ruffian ism and an admirable thing for the police to be on such intimate juggling terms with the night
these double edged rascals do exist
however that may be clashes ous had gone astray and was not found again
javert appeared to be more irritated than amazed at this
as for marius that booby of a lawyer who had probably become frightened and whose name is very had forgotten javert attached very little importance to him
moreover a lawyer can be hunted up at any time
but waste a lawyer after all
the investigation had begun
the magistrate had thought it advisable not to put one of these men of the band of patron minette in close confinement in the hope that he would chatter
this man was brun on the long haired man of the rue du petit ban quiet
he had been let loose in the charlemagne courtyard and the eyes of the watchers were fixed on him
this name of bruno no some of the souvenirs of la force
in that hideous courtyard called the court of the bat i ment neuf new building which the administration called the court saint bernard and which the robbers called the bosses us lions the lion's ditch on thats all covered with scales and leprosy which rose on the left to a level with the roofs near an old door of rusty it on which led to the ancient chapel of the ducal residence of la force then turned in a dormitory for ruffians there could still be seen twelve years ago a sort of fortress roughly carved in the stone with a nail and beneath it this signature beynon
then run on it was the father of the brujo not
the latter of whom the reader caught but a glimpse at the gorge au house was a very cunning and very adroit young spark with a bewildered and plaintive air
it was in consequence of this plaintive air that the magistrate had released him thinking him more useful in the charlemagne yard than in close confinement
robbers do not interrupt their profession because they are in the hands of justice
they do not let themselves be put out by such a trifle as that
to be in prison for one crime is no reason for not beginning of another crime
they are artists who have one picture in the salon and who toil nonetheless on a new work in their studios
bruno n seemed to be stupefied by prison
he could sometimes be seen standing by them out together in front of the cutler's window in the charlemagne yard staring like an idiot at the sordid list of prices which began with garlic centimes and ended with cigar centimes
or he passed his time in trembling chattering his teeth saying that he had a fever and inquiring whether one of the right and twenty beds in the fever ward was vacant
all at once towards the end of february it was discovered that brun on that somnolent fellow had had three different commissions executed by the errand men of the establishment not under his own name but in the name of three of his comrades and they had cost him in all fifty so is an exorbitant outlay which attracted the attention of the prison corporal
inquiries were instituted and on consulting the tariff of commissions posted in the convict's parlor it was learned that the fifty sous could be analyzed as follows three commission's one to the pantheon geneous one to calder race fifteen skis and one to the barriers de grenelle twenty five sous
this last was the dearest of the whole tariff
now at the pantheon at the valve grave and at the barriers we grenelle were situated the domiciles of the three very redoubtable prowlers of the barriers kruk deniers alias bizarre glorify xanex convict and barre faroese upon whom the attention of the police was directed by this incident
it was thought that these men were members of patron minette two of those leaders faber and the kiener had been captured
it was supposed that the messages which had been addressed not to houses but to people who were waiting for them in the street must have contained information with regard to some crime that had been plotted
they were in possession of other indications they laid hand on the three prowlers and supposed that they had circumvented someone or other of bru jon's machinations
about a week after these measures had been taken one night as the superintendent of the watch who had been inspecting the lower dormitory in the ba time mt ne nv was about to drop his chestnut in the box this was the means adopted to make sure that the watchmen performed their duties punctually every hour a chestnut must be dropped into all the boxes nailed to the doors of the dormitories a watchman looked through the peephole of the dormitory and be held frumin sitting on his bed and writing something by the light of the tail lamp
the guardian entered bruno b was put in a solitary cell for a month but they were not able to seize what he had written
the police learned nothing further about it
what is certain is that on the following morning a postilion was flung from the charlemagne yard into the lions' ditch over the five story building which separates the two courtyards
what prisoners call a postilion is a pellet of bread artistically moulded which is went into ireland that is to say over the roots of a prison from one courtyard to another
etymology over england from one land to another into ireland
this little pellet falls in the yard
the man who picks it up opens it and finds in its note addressed to some prisoner in that yard
if it is a prisoner who finds the treasure he forwards the note to its destination if it is a keeper of one of the prisoners secretly sold who are called sheep in prisons and foxes in the galleys the note is taken to the office and handed over to the police
on this occasion the postilion reached its address although the person to whom it was addressed was at that moment in solitary confinement
this person was no other than babe tone of the four heads of patron minette
the postilion contained a roll of paper on which only these two lines were written babe t
there is an affair in the rue plumer
agate on a garden
this is what bruno n had written the night before
in spite of male and female searchers babe t managed to pass the note on from la force to the salle de pere to a good friend whom he had and who was shut up there
this woman in turn transmit tec the note to another woman of her acquaintance a certain matron who was strongly suspected by the police though not yet arrested
this magnon whose name the reader has already seen had relations with the the barrier which will be described in detail later on and she could by going to sweep on one serve as a bridge between the sql petrie team does madeline the s
it happened that at precisely that moment as proofs were wanting in the investigation directed against the barrier in the matter of his daughter sep on one and a selma were released
when spinone came out magnon who was watching the gate of the madeline tree handed her hrk jon's note to babe t charging her to look into the matter
epo nine went to the rue plumer recognized the name and the garden observed the house spied lurked and a few days later brought to magnon who delivers in the rue cloche per seabiscuit which magnin transmitted to faber's mistress in the wallet ridge
a biscuit in the shady symbolism of prisons signifies nothing to be done
so that in less than a week from that time as bruno babe babe tustin the circle of la force the one on his way to the examination the other on his way from it well
asked bhuj on the fuel
biscuit replied babe t
thus did the foetus of crime engendered by bruno non la force miscarry
this miscarriage had its consequences however which were perfectly distinct from bruno b's program ne
the reader will see what they were

he no longer smiled with his infantile smile he had grown morose and no longer received visitors
marius did well not to dream of doing thither
sometimes at the hour when m
have it was on his way to the jardin des plantes the old man and the young man passed each other on the boulevard del' hopital
they did not speak and only exchanged a melancholy sign of the head
a heartbreaking thing it is that there comes a moment when misery looses bonds
two men who have been friends become two chance passersby
royal the bookseller was dead
m
mabe if no longer one who's books his garden of his indigo these were the three forms which happiness pleasure and hope had assumed for him
this sufficed him for his living
he said to himself when i shall have made my balls of blue int i shall be rich i will withdraw my copper plates from the pawn shop i will put my flora in vogue again with trickery plenty of money and advertisements in the newspapers and i will fuji know well where a copy of pierre de mer one's art denavir her with woodcuts edition of
in the meantime he toiled all day over his plot of indigo and at night he returned home to water his garden and to read his books
at that epoch m
made it was nearly eighty years of age
one evening he had a singular apparition
he had returned home while it was still broad daylight
mother plug atque whose health was declining was ill and in bed
he had dined on a bone of which a little meat lingered and a bit of bread that he had found on the kitchen table and had seated himself on an overturned stone post which took the place of a bench in his garden
near this bench there rose after the fashion in orchard gardens a sort of large chest of beams and plan is much dilapidated a rabbit hutch on the ground floor a fruit closet on the first
there was nothing in the hutch but there were a few apples in the fruit closet the remains of the winter's provision
m
have it had set himself to turning over and reading with the aid of his glasses two books of which he was passionately find and in which a serious thing at his age he was interested
his natural timidity rendered him accessible to the acceptance of superstitions in a certain degree
the first of these books was the famous treatise of president del andre del' in constance desdemona the other was a quarto by my horse park baudis re sur les viable seed aubert et les gobelins de la nieve e
this past mentioned old volume interested him all the more because his garden had been one of the spots haunted by goblins in former times
the twilight had begun to whiten what was on high and to blacken all below
as he read over the top of the book which he held in his hand father mabs it was surveying his plants and among others a magnificent rhododendron which was one of his consolations four days of heat wind and sun without a drop person had passed the stalls were bending the buds dropping the leaves falling all this needed water the rhododendron was particularly sad
rather have it was one of those per wins for whom plants have souls
the old man had toiled all day over his indigo plot he was worn out with fatigue but he rose laid his books on the bench and walked all bent over and with tottering footsteps to the well but when he had grasped the chain he could not even draw it sufficiently to unhook it
then he turned round and cast a glance of anguish toward heaven which was becoming studded with stars
the evening had that serenity which overwhelms the troubles of man beneath an indescribably mournful and eternal joy
the night promised to be as adidas the day had been
stars everywhere
thought the old man not the tiniest cloud
not a drop of water
and his head which had been up raised for a moment fell back upon his breast
he raised it again and once more looked at the sky murmuring a year of dew
a little pity
he tried again to unhook the chain of the well and could not
at that moment he heard a voice saying rather have it would you like to have me water your garden for you
at the same time ago ideas of a wild animal passing became audible in the hedge and he beheld emerging from the shrubbery a sort of tall slender girl who drew herself up in front of him and stared boldly at him
she had less the air of a human being than of a form which had just blossomed forth from the twilight
before father man eur who was easily terrified and who was as we have said quick to take alarm was able to reply by a single syllable this being whose movements had a sort of odd abruptness in the darkness had unhooked the chain plunged in and withdrawn the bucket and filled the watering pot and the goodman be held this apparition which had bare feet and a tattered petticoat running about among the flower beds distributing life around her
the sound of the watering pot on the leaves filled rather have it's soul with ecstasy
it seemed to him that the rhododendron was happy now
the first bucket ful emptied the girl drew a second then a third
she watered the whole garden
there was something about her as she this ran about among paths where her outline appeared perfectly black waving her angular arms and with her rich hall in rats that resembled a bat
when she had finished rather have it approached her with tears in his eyes and laid his hand on her brow
god will bless you said he you are an angel since you take care of the flowers
no she replied
i am the devil but that's all the same time
the old man exclaimed without either waiting for or hearing her response what a pity that i am so unhappy and so poor and that i can do nothing for you
you can do something said she
what
tell me where m
mario's lives
the old man did not understand
what monsieur marius
he raised his glassy eyes and seemed to be seeking something that had vanished
a young man who used to come here
in the meantime m
have it had searched his memory
ah
yes he exclaimed
i know what you mean
wait
monsieur marius the baron marius long mercy par bleu
he lives or rather be no longer lives ah well idon't know
as he spoke he had bent over to train a branch of rhododendron and he continued hold i know now
he very often passed along the boulevard and goes in the direction of the glaciers rue st luke barge
the meadow of the park
go there
it is not hard to meet him
when m
mabe he straightened himself up there was no longer anyone there the girl had disappeared
he was decidedly terrified
really he thought of my garden had not been watered i should think that she was a spirit
an hour later when he was in bed it came back to him and as he fell asleep at that confused moment when thought like that fabulous bird which changes itself into a fish in order to cross the sea little by little assumes the form of a dream in order to traverse slumber he said to himself in a bewildered way in sooth that greatly resembles what run audie re narrated of the goblins
could it have been a goblin
chapter iv an apparition to marius some days after this visitors spirit to farmer have if one morning it was on a monday the day when marius borrowed the hundreds ou piece from source tractor the barrier marius had put this coin in his pocket and before carrying it to the clerk's office he had gone to take a little stroll in the hope that this would make him work on his return
it was always thus however
as soon as he rose he seated himself before a book and a sheet of paper in order to scribble some translation his task at that epoch consisted in turning into french a celebrated quarrel between germans the fans and savigny controversy he took savigny he took banstead four lines tried to write one could not saw a star between him and his paper and rose from his chair saying i shall go out
that will put me i'm spirits
and off he went to the lark's meadow
there he beheld more than ever the star and less than ever savigny and fans
he returned home tried to take up his work again and did not succeed there was no means of're knotting a single one of the threads which were broken in his brain then he said to himself i will not go out tomorrow
it prevents my working
and he went out every day
he lived in the lark's meadow more than it source urac's lodgings
that was his real address boulevard de la sante at the seventh free from the rue croyle barge
that morning he had quitted the seventh tree and had seated himself on the parapet of the river des gobelins
a cheerful sunlight penetrated the freshly unfolded and luminous leaves
he was dreaming of her
and his meditation turning to a reproach fell back upon himself he reflected role fully on his idleness his paralysis of soul which was gaining on him end of that night which was growing more dense every moment before him to such a point that he no longer even saw the sun
nevertheless athwart this painful extrication of indistinct ideas which was not even a monologue so feeble had action become in him and he had no longer the force to care to despair at heart this melancholy absorption sensations from without did reach him
he heard behind him beneath him on both banks of the river the la undresses of the gobelins beating their linen and above his head the birds chattering and singing in the elm trees
on the one hand the sound of liberty the careless happiness of the leisure which has wings on the other the sound of toil
what caused him to meditate deeply and almost reflect were two cheerful sounds
all at once in the midst of his rejected ecstasy he heard a familiar voice saying come
here he is
he raised his eyes and recognized that wretched child who had come to him one morning the elder of the the hardier daughter sep on one he knew her name now
strange to say she had grown poorer and prettier two steps which it had not seemed with inner power to take
she had accomplished a double progress towards the light and towards distress
she was barefooted and in rats as on the day when she had so resolutely entered his chamber only her rats were two months older now the holes were larger the rafters more sordid
it was the same harsh voice the same brow dimmed and wrinkles with tan the same free wild and vacillating glance
she had besides more than formerly interface that indescribably terrified and lamentable something which sojourn in a prison adds to wretchedness
she had bits of straw and hay in her hair not like ophelia through having gone mad from the contagion of hamlet's madness but because she had slept in the loft of some stable
and in spite of it all she was beautiful
what a star art thou o youth
in the meantime she had halted in front of marius with a trace of joy in her livid countenance and something which resembled a smile
she stood for several moments as though incapable of speech
so i have met you a toast
she said at length
rather have it was right it was on this boulevard
how i have hunted for you
if you only knew
do you know
i have been in the jug
a fortnight
they let me out
seeing that there was nothing against me and that moreover i had not reached years of discretion
i lack two months of it
oh
how i have hunted for you
these six weeks
so youdon''t live down there anymore
no. said marius
ah
i understand
because of that affair
those takedowns are disagreeable
you cleared out

why do you dear old hat's like this
a young man like you ought to have fine clothes
do you know monsieur marius rather have it calls you baron marius idon't know what
itisn't true that you are a baron
barone are old fellows they go to the luxembourg in front of the chateau where there is the most sun and they read the quotidienne for a sou
i once carried a letter to abadon of that sort
he was over a hundred years old
say where do you live now
marius made no reply
ah
she went on you have a hole in your shirt
i must see it up for you
she resumed with an expression which gradually clouded over youdon''t see'm glad to see me
marius held his peace she remained silent for a moment then exclaimed but if i choose nevertheless i could force you to look glad
what
demanded marius
what do you mean
ah
you used to call me thou she retorted
well then what dost thou mean
she got her lips she seemed to hesitate as though a prey to some sort of inward conflict
at last she appeared to come to a decision
so much the worse idon't care
you have a melancholy air i want you to be pleased
only promise me that you will smile
i want to see you smile and hear you say' ah well that's good
' poor mr.
marius
you know
you promised me that you would give me anything i like yes
only speak
she looked marius full of the eye and said i have the address
marius turned pale
all the blood flowed back to his heart
what address
the address that you asked me to get
she added as though with an effort the address you know very well
yes
stammered marius
of that young lady
this word uttered she sighed deeply
marius sprang from the parapet on which he had been sitting and seized her hand distractedly
oh
well
lead me thither
tell me
ask of me anything you wish
where is it
come with me she responded
idon't know the street or number very well it is in quite the other direction from here but i know the house well i will take you to it
she withdrew her hand and went on in a tone which could have rent the heart of an observer but which did not even graze marius in his intoxicated and ecstatic state oh
how glad you are
a cloud swept across marius' brow
he seized el on one by the arms wear one thing to me
's wear
said she what does that mean
come
you want me to swear
and she laughed
your father
promise keep on one
swear to me that you will not give this address to your father
she turned to him with a stupefied air
epo fine
how do you know that my name keep on ind
promise what i tell you
but she did not seem to hear him
that's nice
you have called me so phone
marius grasped both her arms at once
but answer me in the name of heaven
pay attention to what i am saying to you swear to me that you will not tell your father this address that you know
my father
said she
ah yes my father
be a tease
he's in close confinement
besides what do i care for my father
but you do not promise me
exclaimed marius
let goodie
she said bursting into a laugh now you do shake me

i swear that to you
what is that time
i will not tell my father the address
there

nor to anyone
said marius
nor to anyone
now resumed marius take me there
immediately
immediately
come along
ah
how pleased he is
said she
after a few steps she halted
you are following me too closely monsieur marius
let me go on ahead and follow me so without seeming to do it
a nice young man like you must not be seen with a woman like me
no tongue can express all that lay in that word woman thus pronounced by that child
she proceeded a dozen paces and then halted once more marius joined her
she addressed him sideways and without turning towards him by the way you know that you promised me something
marius fumbled in his pocket
all that he owned in the world was the five france intended for the harriet the father
he took them and laid them info on one's hand
she opened her fingers and let the coin fall to the ground and gazed at him with a gloomy air
idon't want your money said she
book third
the house in the rue plumer chapter i. the house with a secret about the middle of the last century a chief justice in the parliament of paris having a mistress and concealing the fact for at that period the grand self bots displayed their mistresses and the bourgeois concealed them had a little house built in the faubourg saint germain in the deserted the boomer which is now called the plumer not far from the spot which was then designated as combat des animaux
this house was composed of a single stories pavilion two rooms on the ground floor two chambers on the first floor a kitchen downstairs a boudoir upstairs an attic under the roof the whole preceded by a garden with a large gate opening on the street
this garden was about an acre and a half in extent
this was all that could've seen by passersby but behind the pavilion there was a narrow courtyard and at the end of the courtyard a low building consisting of two rooms and a cellar a sort of preparation destined to conceal a child and nurse in case of need
this building communicated in the rear by a masked door which opened by a secret spring with a long narrow paved winding corridor open to the sky hemmed in with two potty walls which hidden with wonderful art and lost as it were between garden enclosures and cultivated land all of whose angles and detours it followed ended in another door also with a secret lock which opened a quarter of a league away almost in another quarter at the solitary extremity of the rue du babylone
through this the chief justice entered so that even those who were spying on him and following him would merely have observed that the justice betook himself every day in a mysterious way somewhere and would never have suspected that to go to the rue de babylone was to go to the rue boomer
thanks to clever purchasers of land the magistrate had been able to make a secret sewer like passage on his own property and consequently without interference
later on he had sold in little parcels for gardens and market gardens the lots of ground adjoining the corridor and the proprietors of these lots on both sides thought they had a party wall before their eyes and did not even suspect the long paved ribbon winding between two walls amid their flower beds and their orchards
only the birds be held this curiosity
it is probable that the linnet sandton guts of the last century gossiped a great deal about the chief justice
the pavilion built of stone in the taste of hansard wainscot ed and furnished in the watteau style to caille on the inside old fashioned on the outside walked in with a triple h edge of flowers had something discreet coquettish and solemn about it as befits a caprice of love and magistracy
this house and corridor which have now disappeared were in existence fifteen years ago
in' a coppersmith had purchased the house with the idea of demolishing it but had not been able to pay the price the nation made him bankrupt
so that it was the house which demolished the coppersmith
after that the house remained uninhabited and fell slowly to ruin as does every dwelling to which the presence of man does not communicate life
it had remained fitted with its old furniture was always for sale or to let and the tenor a dozen people who passed through the rheoli met were warned of the fact by a yellow and illegible bit of writing which had hung on the garden wall since
towards the end of the restoration these same passersby might have noticed that the bill had disappeared and even that the shutters on the first floor were open
the house was occupied in fact
the windows had short curtains a sign that there was a woman about
in the month of october a man of a certain age had presented himself and had hired the house just as it stood including ofcourse the back building and the land which ended in the rue de babylone
he had had the secret openings of the two doors to this passage repaired
the house as we have just mentioned was still very nearly furnished with the justice's old fitting the new tenant had ordered some repairs had added what was lacking here and there had replaced the paving stones in the yard bricks in the floors steps in the stairs missing bits in the inlaid floors and the glass in the lattice windows and has finally installed himself there with a young girl and an elderly maidservant without commotion rather like a person who is slipping in than like a man who is entering his own house
the neighbors did not gossip about him for the reason that there were no neighbors
this unobtrusive tenant was jean valjean the young girl was cosette
the servant was a woman named toussaint whom jean valjean had saved from the hospital and from wretchedness and who was elderly a stammered and from the provinces three qualities which had decided jean valjean to take her with him
he had hired the house under the name of m
gauche le vent independent gentleman
in all that has been related heretofore the reader has doubtless been no less prompt than the barrier to recognize jean valjean
why had jean valjean quitted the convent of the petit pic pic
what had happened
nothing had happened
it will be remembered that jean valjean was happy in the convent so happy that his conscience finally took the alarm
he saw cosette every day he felt paternity spring up and develop within him more and more he brooded over the soul of that child he said to himself that she was his that nothing could take her from him that this would last indefinitely that she would certainly become a jun being there to gently invited every day that thus the convent was henceforth the universe for her as it was for him that he should grow old there and that she would grow up there that she would grow old there and that he should die there that in short delightful hope no separation was possible
on reflecting upon this he fell into perplexity
he interrogated himself
he asked himself if all that happiness were really his if it were not composed of the happiness of another of the happiness of that child which he an old man was confiscating and stealing if that were not theft
he said to himself that this child had a right to know line before renouncing it that to deprive her in advance and in some sort without consulting her of all joys under the pretext of saving her from all trials to take advantage of her ignorance of her isolation in order to make an artificial vocation germinate in her was toyota human creature of its nature and to lie to god
and who knows it when she came to be aware of all this someday and found herself an into her sorrow cosette would not come to hate him
w last almost selfish thought and less heroic than the rest but which was intolerable to him
he resolved to quit the convent
he resolved on this he recognized with anguish the fact that it was necessary
as for objections there were none
five years' sojourn between these four walls and of disappearance had necessarily destroyed or dispersed the elements of year
he could return tranquilly among men
he had grown old and all had undergone a change
who would recognize him now
and then to face the worst there was danger only for himself and he had no right to condemn cosette to the cloister for the reason that he had been condemned to the galleys
besides what is danger in comparison with the right
finally nothing prevented his being prudent and taking his precautions
as for cosette's education it was almost finished and complete
his determination once taken he awaited an opportunity
it was not long in presenting itself
olde such eleven tried
jean valjean demanded an audience with the revered prioress and told her that having come into a little inheritance at the death of his brother which permitted him henceforth to live without working he should leave the service of the convent and take his daughter with him but that as it was not just that cosette since she had not taken the vows should have received her education gratuitously he humbly begged the reverend prioress to see fit that he should offer to the community as indemnity for the five years which cosette had spent there the sum of five thousand francs
it was thus that jean valjean quitted the convent of the perpetual adoration
on leaving the convent he took in his own arms the little valise the key to which he still wore on his person and would permit no porter to touch it
this puzzled cosette because of the odor of embalming which proceeded from it
let us state at once that this trunk never quitted him more
he always had it in his chamber
it was the first and only thing sometimes that he carried off in his moving when he moved about
cosette laughed at it and called this valid e his inseparable saying i am jealous of it
nevertheless jean valjean did not reappear in the open air without profound anxiety
he discovered the house in the rue plumer and hid himself from sight there
henceforth he was in the possession of the name ultime caucus le vent
at the same time he hired two other apartments in paris in order that he might attract less attention than if he were to remain always in the same quarter and so that he could st. need take himself off at the slightest did quietude which should assail him and in short so that he might not again he caught in provide was on the night when he had so miraculously escaped from javert
these two apartments were very pitiable poor in appearance and in two quarters which were far remote from eachother the one in the rue del' ouest the other in the rue del' homme arms
he went from time to time now to the rue del' homme armenia to the rue del' ouest to pass a month or six weeks without taking toussaint
he had himself served by the porters and gave himself out as a gentleman from the suburbs living on his funds and having a little temporary resting place in town
this lofty virtue had three domiciled in paris for the sake of escaping from the police
chapter ii jean valjean as a national guard however properly speaking he lived in the tie plumer and he had arranged his existence there in the following fashion cosette and the servant occupied the pavilion she had the big sleeping room with the painted pier glasses the boudoir with the gilded fillets the justice's drawing room furnished with tapestries and fast armchairs she had the garden
jean valjean had a canopied bed of antique damaso in three colors and a beautiful persian rug purchased in the rue du fi guide saint paul at mother gaucher's put into cosette's chamber and in order to redeem the severity of these magnificent old things he had amalgamated with this bric a brac all the gay and graceful little pieces of furniture suitable to young girls and rage're a bookcase filled with gilt edge ebooks an inlet and a blotting book papers work table inc rusted with mother of pearl a silver gilt dressing cases toilet service in japanese porcelain
long damask curtains with a red foundation and three colors like those on the bed hung at the windows of the first floor
on the ground floor the curtains were of tapestry
all winter long cosette's little house was heated from top to bottom
jean valjean inhabited the sort of porter's lodge which was situated at the end of the back courtyard with a mattress on a folding beds white wood table two straw chair can earthenware water jug a few old volumes on a shelf his beloved valise in one corner and never any fire
he dined with cosette and he had a loaf of black bread on the table for his own use
when toussaint came he had said to get it is the young lady who is the mistress of this house
and you monsieur
toussaint replied in amazement
i am a much better thing than the master i am the father
cosette had been taught housekeeping in the convent and she regulated their expenditure which was very modest
everyday jean valjean put his arm through cosette's and took her for a walk
he led her to the luxembourg to the least frequented walk and every sunday he took her to mass at saint jacques du haut pas because that was a long way off
as it was a very poor quarter he bestowed aims largely there and the poor people surrounded him in church which had drawn down upon him the barrier's epistle to the benevolent gentleman of the church of saint jacques du haut pas
he was fond of taking cosette to visit the poor and the sick
no stranger ever entered the house in the rue plumer
toussaint brought their provisions and jean valjean went himself for water to a fountain nearby on the boulevard
their wood and wine were put into a half subterranean hollow lined with rock work which lay near the rue de babylone and which had formerly served the chief justice as a grotto for at the epoch of follies and little houses no love was without a grotto
in the door opening on the guest babylone there was a box destined for the reception of letters and papers only as the three inhabitants of the pavilion in the fuel line t received neither papers nor letters the entire usefulness of that box formerly the go between of a love affair and the confidant of a lovelorn lawyer was how limited to the tax collector's notices and the summons of the guard
form
gauche i event independent gentleman belonged to the national guard he had not been able to escape through the fine meshes of the census of
the municipal information collected at that time had even reached the convent of the petit pick usa sort of impenetrable and holy cloud whence jean valjean had emerged in venerable guide and consequently worthy of mounting guard in the eyes of the town hall
three or four times a year jean valjean donned his uniform and mounted guard he did this willingly however it was a correct disguise which mixed him with everyone and yet left him solitary
jean valjean had just attained his sixtieth birthday the age of legal exemption but he did not appear to be over fifty moreover he had no desire to escape his sergeant major not to quibble with comte de lo bay he possessed no civil status he was concealing his name needs concealing his identity so he concealed his age he concealed everything and as we have just said he willingly did his duty as a national guard the sum of his ambition latin resembling any other man who paid his taxes
this man had form is ideal within the angel without the bourgeois
let us not done detail however when jean valjean went out with cosette he dressed as the reader has already seen and had the air of a retired officer
when he went out alone which was generally at night he was always dressed in a workingman's trousers and blouse and wore a cap which concealed his race
was this precaution of humility
both
cosette was accustomed to the enigmatic al side of her destiny and hardly noticed her father's peculiarities
as for toussaint she generated jean valjean and thought everything he did right
one day her butcher who had caught a glimpse of jean valjean said to her that's a queer fish
she replied he's a faint
neither jean valjean norco set tenor toussaint ever entered or emerged except by the door on the rue de babylone
unless seen through the garden gate it would have been difficult to guess that they lived in the rue plumer
that gate was always closed
jean valjean had left the garden uncultivated in order not to attract attention
in this possibly be made a mistake
chapter iii folio saffron sinus the garden thus left to itself for more than half a century had become extraordinary and charming
the passersby of forty years ago halted to gaze at it without a suspicion of the secrets which it hid in its fresh and verdant depths
more than one dreamed of that epoch often allowed his thoughts and his eyes to penetrate in discreetly between the bars of that ancient padlocked gate twisted tottering fastened to two green and joss covered pillars and oddly crowned with specimen for indecipherable arabesque
there was a stone bench in one corner one or two mouldy statues several lattices which had lost their nails with time were rotting in the wall and there were no walks not hurt but there was enough grass everywhere
gardening had taken its departure and nature had returned
weeds a bounded which was a great piece of luck for a poor corner of land
the festival of gilli flowers was something splendid
nothing in this garden obstructed the sacred effort of things towards life venerable growth reigned there among them
the trees had bent over towards the nettles the plant had sprung upward the branch had inclined that which crawls on the earth had gone in search of that which expands in the air that which floats on the wind had bent over towards that which trails in the moss trunks boughs leaves fibres clusters tendrils shoots spines thorns had mingled crossed married confounded themselves in each other vegetation in a deep and close embrace had celebrated and accomplished there under the well pleased eye of the creator in that enclosure three hundred feet square the holy mystery of fraternity symbol of the human fraternity
this garden was no longer a garden it was a colossal thicket that is to say something as impenetrable as a forest as people rasa city quivering like a next sombre like a cathedral fragrant like a bouquet solitary as a tomb living as a throng
in flores of his enormous thicket free behind its fate and within its four walls entered upon the secret labor of termination quivered in the rising sun almost like an animal which drinks in the breaths of cosmic love and which feels the sap of april rising and boiling in its cribs and shakes to the wind its enormous wonderful green locks sprinkled on the camp earth on the defaced statues on the crumbling steps of the pavilion and even on the pavement of the deserted street flowers like stars dew like pearls fecundity beauty life joy perfumes
at midday a thousand white butterflies took refuge there and it was a divine spectacle to see that living summer snow whirling about the're in flames amid the shade
there in those gay shadows of verdure a throng of innocent voices spoke sweetly to the soul and what the twittering forgot to say the humming completed
in the evening a dreamy vapor exhaled from the garden and enveloped it a shroud of mist a calm and celestial sadness covered it the intoxicating perfume of the honeysuckle sand convolvulus poured out from every part of it like an exquisite and subtle poison the last appeals of the woodpeckers and the way tails were audible as they dozed among the branches one felt the sacred intimacy of the birds and the trees by day the wings rejoice the leaves by night the leaves protect the wings

chapter iv change of hate it seemed that this garden created in olden days to conceal wanton mysteries had been transformed and become fitted to shelter chaste mysteries
there were no longer either arbors or bowling greens or tunnels or grottos there was a magnificent dishevelled obscurity falling like a veil overall
paphos had been made over into eden
it is impossible to say what element of repentance had rendered this retreat wholesome
this flower girl now offered her blossom to the soul
this coquettish garden formerly decidedly compromised had returned to digg unity and modesty
a justice assisted by a gardener a good man who thought that he was a continuation ofl' amour non and another good man who thought that he was a continuation of le notre had turned it about but ruffled've died moulded it to gallantry nature had taken possession of it once more had filled it with shade and had arranged it for love
there was also in this solitude a heart which was quite ready
love had only to show himself he had here a temple composed of verdure grass miss the sight of birds tender shadows agitated branches and a soul made of sweetness of faith of candor of hope of aspiration and of illusion
cosette had left the convent when she was still almost a child she was a little more than fourteen and she was at the ungrateful and we have already said that with the exception of her eyes she was homely rather than pretty she had noun graceful feature but she was awkward thin timid and bold at once a grown up little girl in short
her education was finished that is to say she has been taught religion and even and above all devotion them history that is to say the thing that bears that game in convenes geography grammar the participles the kings of france a little music a little drawing etc
but in all other respects she was utterly ignorant which is a great charm and a great peril
the soul of a young girl should not be left in the dark later on mirages that are too abrupt and too lively are formed the reason a dark chamber
she should be gently and discreetly enlightened rather with the reflection of realities than with their harsh and direct light
a useful and graciously austere half light which dissipates puerile fears and obviates falls
there is nothing but the maternal instinct that admirable intuition composed of the memories of the virgin and the experience of the woman which knows how this half light is to be created and of what it should consist
nothing supplies the place of this instinct
all the nuns in the world are not worth as much as one mother in the formation of a young girl's soul
cosette had had no mother
she had only had many mothers in the plural
actor jean valjean he was indeed all tenderness all solicitude but he was only an old man and he knew nothing at all
now in this work of education in this grave matter of preparing a woman for life what science is required to combat that vast ignorance which is called innocence
nothing prepares a young girl for passions like the convent
the convent turns the thoughts in the direction of the unknown
the heart thus thrown back upon itself works downward within itself since it can not overflow and grows deep since it can not expand
hence didion's suppositions conjectured outlines of romances a desire for adventures fantastic constructions edifices built wholly in the inner obscurity of the mind sombre and secrets nodes where the passions immediately find a lodgement as soon as the open gate permits them to enter
the convent is a compression which in order to triumph over the human heart should last during the whole life
on quitting the convent cosette could have found nothing more sweet and more can feel us than the house in the rue plumer
it was the continuation of solitude with the beginning of liberty a garden that was closed bugs nature that was a crib rich voluptuous and fragrant the same dream was in the convent but with glimpses of young men w heating but one that opened in the street
still when she arrived there we repeat she was only a child
jean valjean have this neglected garden over to her
do what you like with it he said to her
this amused cosette she turned over all the clumps and all the stones she hunted for beasts she played in it while awaiting the time when she would dream in its he loved this garden for the insects that she found beneath her feet amid the grass while awaiting the day when she would love it for the stars that she would see through the boughs above her head
and then she loved her father that is to say jean valjean with all her soul with an innocent filial passion which made the goodman a beloved and charming companion to her
it will be remembered that m
madeleine had been in the habit of reading a great deal
jean valjean had continued this practice he had come to converse well he possesses the secret riches and the eloquence of a true and humble mind which has spontaneously cultivated itself
he retained just enough sharpness to season his kindness his mind was tough and his heart was soft
during their conversations in the luxembourg he gave her explanations of everything drawing on what he had read and also on what he had suffered
as she listened to him cosette's eyes wandered vaguely about
this simple man sufficed for cosette's thought the same as the wild garden sufficed for her eyes
when she had had a good chase after the butterflies she came panting up to him and said am
how i have run
he kissed her brow
cosette adored the goodman
she was always at his heels
where jean valjean was there happiness was
jean valjean lived neither in the pavilion nor the garden she took greater pleasure in the paved back courtyard than in the enclosure filled with flowers and in his little lodge furnished with straw seated chairs than in the great drawing room hung with tapestry against which stood tufted easy chairs
jean valjean sometimes said to her smiling at his happiness in being import unesco go to your own quarters
leave me alone a little
she gave him those charming and tenders folding's which are so graceful when they come from a daughter to her father
father i am very cold in your rooms whydon't you have a carpet here and active
dear child there are so many people who are better than i and who have not even a roof over their heads
then why is there a fire in my rooms and everything that is needed
because you are a woman and a child
bah
just ten be cold and feel uncomfortable
certain men
that is good i shall come here so often that you will be obliged to have a fire
and again she said to him father why do you eat horrible bread like that
because my daughter
well if you eat it i will eat it too
then in order to prevent cosette eating black bread jean valjean are white bread
cosette had but a confused recollection of her childhood
she prayed morning and evening for her mother whom she had never known
the the barriers had remained with her as two hideous figures in a dream
she remembered that she had gone one day at night to fetch water in a forest
she thought that it had been very far from paris
it seemed to get that she had begun to live in an abyss and that it was jean valjean who had rescued her from it
her childhood produced upon her the effect of a time when there had been nothing around her but mill specs spiders and serpents
when she meditated on the evening before falling asleep as she had not a very clear idea that she was jean valjean's daughter and that he was her father she fancied that the soul of her mother had passed into that goodman and had come to dwell near her
when he was seated she leaned her cheek against his white hair and dropped a silent year saying to herself perhaps this man is my mother
cosette although this is a strange statement to make in the profound ignorance of a girl brought up in a convent maternity being also absolutely unintelligible to virginity has ended by fancying that she had had as little mother as possible
she did not even know her mother's name
whenever she asked jean valjean jean valjean remained silent
if she repeated her question he responded with a smile
once she insisted the smile ended instead
this silence on the part of jean valjean covered fan time with darkness
was it prudence
was it respect
sarita fear that he should deliver this name to the hazards of another memory than his own
so long as cosette had been small jean valjean had been willing to talk to her of her mother when she became a young girl it was impossible for him to do so
it seemed to him that he no longer cared
was it because of cosette
was it because levantine
he felt a certain religious horror at letting that shadow enter code eye's thought and of placing a third in their destiny
the more sacred this shade was to him the more did it seem that it was to be feared
he thought of fan time and felt himself overwhelmed with silence
through the darkness he vaguely perceived something which appeared to have it's finger on its lips
had all the modesty which had been in ran fine and which had violently quitted her during her lifetime returned to rest upon her after her death to watch in indignation over the peace of that dead woman and in its shyness to keep her in her grave
was jean valjean unconsciously submitting to the pressure
we who believe in death are not among the number who will reject this mysterious explanation
hence the impossibility of uttering even for cosette that name of bantine
one day cosette said to him father i saw my nor her in a dream last night
she had two big wings
my mother must have been almost a saint during her life
through martyrdom replied jean valjean
however jean valjean was happy
when cosette went out with him she leaned on his arm proud and happy in the plenitude of her heart
jean valjean felt his heart melt within him with delight at all these sparks of a tenderness so exclusive so wholly satisfied with himself alone
the poor man trembled inundated with angelic joy he declared to himself ecstatically that this would last all their lives he told himself that he really had not suffered sufficiently home tutsi radiant an loss and he thanked god in the depths of his soul for having permitted him to be loved this new wretch by that innocent bring
chapters the rose perceives that it is an engine of war one day cosette chanced to look at herself in her mirror and she said to herself really
it seemed to her almost that she was pretty
this threw her in a singularly troubled state of mind
up to that moment she had never thought of her face
she saw herself in her mirror but she did not look at herself
and then she had so often been told that she was homely jean valjean alone said gently no indeed
no indeed
at all events cosette had always thought herself homely and had grown up on that belief with the easy resignation of childhood
and here all at once was her mirror saying to her as jean valjean had said no indeed
that night she did not sleep
what if i were pretty
she thought
how odd it would be if i were pretty
and she recalled those of her companions whose beauty had produced a sensation in the convent and she said to herself what
ami to be like mademoiselle sk and so
the next morning she looked at herself again not by accident this time and she was assailed with doubts where did i get such an idea
said she hoi an ugly
she had not slept well that was all her eyes were sunken and she was pale
she had not felt very joyous on the preceding evening in the belief that she was beautiful but it made her very sad not to be able to believe in it any longer
she did not look at her self again and for more than a fortnight she tried to dress her hair with her back turned to the mirror
in the evening after dinner she general pg embroidered in wool or did some convent needlework in the drawing room and jean valjean read beside her
once she raised her eyes from her work and was rendered quite uneasy by the manner in which her father was gazing at her
on another occasion she was passing along the street and it seemed to her that someone behind her whom she did not see said a pretty woman
but badly dresser
bay
she thought he does not mean me
i am well dressed and ugly
she was then wearing a plush hat and her merino gown
at last one day when she was in the garden she heard poor old toussaint saying do you notice how pretty cosette is growing air
cosette did not hear her father's reply but toussaint's words caused a sort of commotion within her
she fled from the garden ran up to her room flew to the looking glass it was three months since she had looked at herself and gave vent to a dry
she had just dazzled herself
she was beautiful and lovely she could not help agreeing with toussaint and her mirror
her figure was formed her skin had grown white her hair was lustrous an unaccustomed splendid had been lighted in her blue eyes
the consciousness of her beauty burst upon her in an instant like the sudden advent of daylight other people noticed it also toussaint had said so it was evidently she of whom the passerby had spoken there could no longer be any doubt of that she descended to the garden again thinking herself a queen ims giving that she heard the birds singing though it was winter seeing the sky gilded the sun among the trees flowers in the thickets distracted wild in inexpressible delight
jean valjean on his side experienced a deep and in debit able oppression at heart
in fact he had for some time past been done so playing with terror that beauty which seemed to grow more radiant every day on cosette's sweet face
the dawn that was smiling for all was gloomy fortin
cosette had been beautiful for a tolerably long time before she became aware of it herself
but from the very first day that unexpected light which was rising slowly and enveloping the whole of the young girl's person wounded jean valjean's sombre eye
he felt that it was a change in a happy life a life so happy that he did not dare to move for fear of dis arranging something
this man who had passed through all manner of distressed who was still all bleeding from the bruises of fate who had been almost wicked and who had become almost a saint who after having dragged the chain of the valleys was now dragging the invisible but heavy chain of indefinite misery this man whom the law had not released from its grasp and who could be seized at any moment and brought back from the obscurity of his virtue to the broad daylight of public opprobrium this man accepted all excused all pardoned all and merely asked of providence of man of the law of society of nature of the world one thing that cosette might love him
that cosette might continue to love him
that god would not prevent the heart of the child from coming to him and from remaining with him
beloved by cosette he felt that he was healed rested appeased loaded with benefits recompensed crowned
beloved by cosette it was well with him
he asked nothing more
has anyone said to him do you want anything better
he would have answered no
god might have said to him do you desire heaven
and he would have replied i should lose by it
everything which could affect this situation if only on the surface made him shudder like the beginning of something new
he had never known very distinctly himself what the beauty of a woman means but he understood instinctively that it was something terrible
he gazed with terror on this beauty which was blossoming out ever more triumphant and superb beside him beneath his very eyes on the innocent and formidable brow of that child from the depths of her home lines so this old age of his misery of his reprobation
he said to himself how beautiful she is
what is to become of me
there more overlay the difference between his tenderness and the tenderness of another
what he beheld with anguish another would have gazed upon with joy
the first symptoms were not long in making their appearance
in the very morrow of the day on which she had said to herself decidedly i am beautiful
cosette began to pay attention to her toilet
she recalled the remark of that passed by pretty but badly dressed the breath of an oracle which had passed beside her and had vanished after depositing in her heart one of the two terms which are destined later on to fill the whole life of woman coquet ry
love is the other
with faith in her beauty the whole feminine soul expanded within her
she conceived a mirror for her merino's and shame for her plus that
her father had never refused her anything
she at once acquired the whole science of the bonnet the gown the mantle the boot the duff the stuff which is in fashion the color which is becoming that science which makes of the parisian woman something so charming so deep and so dangerous
the words heavy woman were invented for the parisienne
i'm less than a month little cosette in that the bald of the rue de baby line was not only one of the prettiest but one of the best dressed women in paris which means a great deal more
she would have liked to encounter her passerby to see what he would say and to teach him a lesson
the truth is that she was ravishing in every respect and that she distinguished the difference between a bonnet from gerard and one from her bait in the most marvellous war
jean valjean watched these ravages with anxiety
he who felt that he could never do anything but crawl walk at the most be held wings sprouting in cosette
moreover from the mere inspection of cosette's toilet a woman would have recognized the fact that she had no mother
certain little proprieties certain special conventional ities were not observed by rosette
another for instance would have told her that a young girl does not dress in damask
the first day that cosette went out in her black damask gown and mantle and her white craps bonnet she took jean valjean's arm gay radiant rosy proud dazzling
father she said how do you like me in this guide
jean valjean replied in a voice which resembled the bitter voice of an envious man charming
he was the same as usual during their walk
on their return home tracked cosettedon't you put on that other gown and bonnet again you know the ones i mean
this took place in cosette's chamber
cosette turned towards the wardrobe where her vast off school girl's clothes were hanging
that disguise
said she
rather what do you want me to do with it
ohno the idea
i shall never put on those horrors again
with that machine on my head i have the air of madame mad dog
jean valjean heaved a deep sigh
from that moment forth he noticed that cosette who had always here to fire asked to remain at home saying father i enjoy myself more here with you now was always asking to go out
in fact what is the use of having a handsome face and a delicious costume if one does not display them
he also noticed that cosette had no longer the same taste for the back garden
now she preferred the garden and did not dislike to promenade back and forth in front of the failed fence
jean valjean who was shy never set foot in the garden
he kept to his backyard like a dog
cosette in gaining the knowledge that she was beautiful lost the grace of ignoring it
an exquisite grace for beauty enhanced by ingenuous news is ineffable and nothing is so adorable as a dazzling and innocent creature who walks along holding intern and the key to paradise without being conscious of it
but what she had lost in ingenuous brace sustained in pensive and serious charm
her whole person permeated with the joy of youth of innocence and of beauty breathed forth a splendid melancholy
it was at this epoch that marius after the lapse of six months saw her once more at the luxembourg
chapter vi the battle begun cosette in her shadow like marius in his was all ready to take fire
destiny with its mysterious and fatal patience slowly drew together these two beings all charges and all languishing with the stormy electricity of passion these two souls which were laden with love as two clouds are laden with lightning and which were bound to overflow and mingle in a look like the clouds in a flash of fire
the glance has been so much abused in love romance s. that it has finally fallen into disrepute
one hardly dares to say nowadays that two beings fell in love because they looked at each other
that is the way people for all in love nevertheless and the only way
the rest is nothing but the rest comes afterwards
nothing is more real than these great shocks which two souls convey to each other by the exchange of that spark
at that particular hour when cosette unconsciously darted that glance which troubled marius marius had no suspicion that he had also launched a look which disturbed cosette
he caused her the same good and the same evil
she had been in the habit of seeing him for a long time and she had scrutinized him as girls scrutinize and see while looking elsewhere
marius still considered cosette ugly when she had already begun to think marius handsome
but as he paid no attention to her the young man was nothing to her
still she could not refrain from saying to herself that he had beautiful hair beautiful eyes handsome teeth a charming tone of voice when she heard him conversing with his comrades that he held himself badly when he walked if you like but with a grave that was all his own that he did not appear to be at all stupid that his whole person was noble gentle simple proud and that in short though he seemed to be popeye this aug was fine
on the day when their eyes met at last and said to each other those first obscure and ineffable things which the glance lisp's cosette did not immediately understand
she returned thoughtfully to the house in the rue del' ouest where jean valjean according to his custom had come to spend six weeks
the next morning on waking she thought of that strange young man so long indifferent and icy who now seemed to pay attention to her and it did not appear to her that this attention was the least in the world agreeable to her
she was in the contrary somewhat incensed at this handsome and disdainful individual
a substratum of war stirred within her
it struck her and the idea caused her a wholly childish joy that she was going to take her revenge at last
knowing that she was beautiful she was thoroughly conscious though in an indistinct fashion that she possessed a weapon
women play with their beauty as children do with a knife
they sound themselves
the reader will recall marius' hesitations his palpitations his terrors
he remained on his bench and did not approach
this vexed cosette
one day she said to jean valjean father let us stroll about a little in that direct ion
seeing that marius did not come to her she went to him
i'm such cases all women resemble mahomet
and then strange to say the first symptom of true love in a young man is timidity in a young girl it is boldness
this is surprising and yet nothing is more simple
it is the two sexes tending to approach each other and assuming each the other's qualities
that day via etta's glance drove markus beside himself and marius' glance set cosette to trembling
marius went away confident and cosette uneasy
from that day forth they adored each other
the first thing that cosette felt was a confused and profound melancholy
it seemed to her that her soul had become black since the day before
she no longer recognized it
the whiteness of soil in young girls which is composed of coldness and gayety resembles snow
it melts in love which is it's sun
cosette did not know what love was
she had never heard the word uttered in its terrestrial sense
on the books of profane music which entered the convent am our love was replaced by tambour drum orlando ur
this created enigmas which exercised the imaginations of the big girls such as at how delightful is the drum
or pity is not a pan tour
but cosette had left the convent too early to have occup med herself much with the drum
therefore she did not know what name to give to what she now felt
if anyone the less ill because one does not know the name of one's malady
she lived with all the more passion because she loved ignorantly
she did not know whether it was a good thing of a bad thing useful or dangerous eternal or temporary allowable or prohibited she loved
she would have been greatly astonished has anyone said to her you do not sleep
but that is forbidden
you do not eat
why that is very bad
you have oppressions and palpitations of the heart
that must not be
you blush and turn pale when a certain being clad in black appears at the end of a certain green walk
but that is abominable
she would not have understood and she would have replied what fault is there of mine in a matter in which i have no power and of which i know nothing
it turned out that the love which presented itself was exactly suited to the state of her soul
it was a sort of admiration at a distance a mute contemplation the deification of a stranger
it was the apparition of youth to youth the dream of nights become a reality yet remaining a dream the longed for phantom realized and made flesh at last but having as yet neither name not fault nude porno real hence not effect in a dire the distant lover who lingered in the ideal a chimaera with a form
any nearer and more palpable meeting would have alarmed cosette at this first stage when she was still half immersed in the exaggerated mists of the cloister
she had all the fears of children and all the fears of nuns combined
the spirit of the convent with which she had been of the shed for the space of five years was still in the process of slow evaporation from her person and made everything tremble around her
in this situation he was not a lover he was not even an admirer he was a vision
she set herself to adoring marius as something charming luminous and impossible
as extreme innocence borders on extreme co que try she smiled at him with all frankness
every day she looked forward to the hour for their walk with impatience she found marius there she felt herself unspeakably happy and thought in all sincerity that she was expressing her whole thought when she said to jean valjean what a delicious garden that luxembourg is
marine and cosette were in the dark as to one another
they did not address each other they did not salute each other they did not know eachother they saw each other and like stars of heaven which are separated by millions of leagues they lived by gazing at each other
it was thus that cosette gradually became a woman and developed beautiful and living with a consciousness of her beauty and in ignorance of her love
she was a coquette to boot through her ignorance
chapter vii to one sadness oppose a sadness and a half all situations have their instincts
old and eternal mother nature warned jean valjean in a dim way of the presence of marius
jean valjean shuddered to the very bottom of his soul
jean valjean saw nothing knew nothing and yet he scanned with obstinate attention the darkness in which he walked as though he felt on one side of him something in process of construction and on the other something which was crumbling away
marius also warned and in accordance with the deep law of god by that same mother nature did all he could to keep out of sight of the father
nevertheless it came to pass that jean valjean sometimes espied him
marius' manners were no longer in the least natural
he exhibited ambiguous prudence and awkward dating
hs no longer came quite close to them as formerly
he seated himself at a distance and pre tended to be reading why did he pretend that
formerly he had come in his old coat now he wore his new one every day jean valjean was not sure that he did not have his hair curled his eyes were very queer he wore gloves in short jean valjean cordially detected this young man
cosette allowed nothing to be divined
without knowing just what was the matter with her she was convinced that there was something in it and that it must be concealed
there was a coincidence be tween the taste for the toilet which had recently come to cosette and the habit of new clothes developed by that stranger which was very repugnant to jean valjean
it might be accidental no doubt certainly but it was a menacing accident
he never opened his mouth to cosette about this stranger
one day however he could not refrain from so doing and with that vague despair which suddenly casts the lead into the depths of its despair he said to her what a very pedantic air that young man has
cosette but a year before only an indifferent little girl would have replied why no he is charming
ten years later with the love of markus in her heart she would have answered a pedant and insufferable to the sight
you are right
at the moment in life and the heart which she had then attained she contented herself with replying with supreme calmness that young man
as though she now be held him for the first time in her life
how stupid i am
thought jean valjean
she had not noticed him
it is i who have pointed him out timer
oh simplicity of the old
on the depth of children
it is one of the laws of those fresh years of suffering and trouble of those vivacious conflicts between a first love and the first obstacles that the young girl does not allow herself to be caught in any trap whatever and that the young man falls into everyone
jean valjean had instituted an undeclared war against marius which marius with the sublime stupidity of his passion and his age did not divine
jean valjean laid a host of ambushes for him he changed his hour he changed his bench he forgot his handkerchief he came alone to the luxembourg marius dashed headlong into all these shares and to all the interrogation marks planted by jean valjean in his pathway he ingeniously answered yes
but cosette remained injured in her apparent in concern and in her imperturbable tranquillity so that jean valjean arrived at the following conclusion that ginny is madly in love with cosette but coxeter does not even know that he exists
nonetheless did he beat in his heart a mournful tremor
the minute when cosette would love might strike at any moment
does not everything begin with indifference
only once did cosette make a mistake and alarm him
he rose from his seat to depart after a stay of three hours and she said what already
jean valjean had not discontinued his trips to the luxembourg as he did not wish to do anything out of the way and as above all things he feared to arouse cosette but during the hours which were so sweet to the lovers while cosette was sending her smile to the intoxicated marius who perceived nothing else now and who now saw nothing in all the world but an adored and radiant face jean valjean was fixing on marius flashing and terrible eyes
he who had finally come to believe himself incapable of a malevolent feeling experienced moments when marius was present in which he thought he was becoming savage and ferocious once more and he felt the old depths of his soul which had formerly contained so much wrath opening once more and rising up against that young man
it almost seemed to him that unknown craters were working in his bosom
what
he was there that creature
what was he therefor
he came creeping about shelling out exam it off trying
he came saying he y
why not
he came to prowl about his jean valjean's life
to prowl about his happiness with the purpose of seizing it and bearing it away
jean valjean added yes that's it
what is neon search of
an adventure
what does he want
a love affair
a love affair
and i
what

then his eyes were filled with a sad and extraordinary gowan
it was no longer a man gazing at a man it was no longer an enemy surveying an enemy
it was a dog scanning a thief
the reader knows the rest
marius pursued his senseless course
one day he followed cosette to the rue del' ouest
another day he spoke to the porter
the porter on his side spoke and said to jean valjean monsieur who is that curious young man who is asking for you
on the morrow jean valjean bestowed on marius that glance which marius at last perceived
a week later jean valjean had taken his departure
he swore to himself that he would never again set foot either in the luxembourg or in the rue del' ouest
he returned to the rus plumer
cosette did not complain she said nothing she asked no questions she did not seem to learn his reasons she had already reached the point where she was afraid of being divined and of betraying her self
jean valjean had no experience of these miseries the only ii series which are charming and the only ones with which he was not acquainted the consequence was that he did not understand the grave significance of cosette's silence
he merely noticed that she had grown sad and he grew gloomy
on his side and on her son experience has joined issue
once he made a trial
he asked cosette would you like to come to the luxembourg
arch illuminated cosette's pale face
yes said she
they went thither
three months had elapsed
mark is no longer went there
marius was not there
on the following day jean valjean asked cosette again would you like to come to the luxembourg
she replied sadly and gently no
jean valjean was hurt by this sadness and heartbroken at this gentleness
what was going on in that mind which was so young and yet already so impenetrable
what was on its way there within
what was taking place in cosette's soul
sometimes instead of going to bed jean valjean remained seated on his pallet with his head in his hands and he passed whole night's asking himself what has cosette in her mind
and in thinking of the things that she might be thinking about
oh
at such moments what mournful glance said he cast towards that cloister that chaste peak that abode of angels that inaccessible glacier of virtue
how he contemplated with despairing ecstasy that convent garden full of ignored flowers and cloistered virgins where all perfumes and all souls mount straight to heaven
how he adored that even forever closed against him whence he had voluntarily and madly emerged
how he regretted his abnegation and his folly in having brought cosette back into the world poor hero of sacrifice seized and hurled to the earth by his very self devotion
how he said to himself what have is one
however nothing of all this was perceptible to cosette
non litem per mo harshness
his face was always serene and kind
jean valjean's manners were more tender and more paternal than ever
if anything could have betrayed his lack of joy it was his increased quanity
other side cosette languished
she suffered from the absence of marius as she had rejoiced in his presence peculiarly without exactly being conscious of it
when jean valjean ceased to take her on their customary strolls a feminine instinct murmured confusedly at the bottom of her heart that she must not seem to set store on the luxembourg garden and that in this proved to be a matter of indifference to get her father would take her thither once more
but days weeks months elapsed
jean valjean had tacitly accepted cosette's tacit consent
she regretted it
it was too late
so marius had disappeared all was over
the day on which she returned to the luxembourg marius was no longer there
what was to be done
should she ever find him again
she felt an anguish at her heart which nothing relieved and which augmented every day she no longer knew whether it was winter or summer whether it was raining or shining whether the birds were singing whether it was the season for dahlias or daisies whether the luxembourg was more charming than the tuileries whether the linen which the laundress brought home was starched too much or not enough whether toussaint had done her marketing well krill and she remained rejected absorbed attentive to buy a single thought her eyes vague and staring as when one gases by night at a black and fathomless spot where an apparition has vanished
however she did not allow jean valjean to perceive anything of this except her pallor
she still wore her sweet face for him
this pallor sufficed but too thoroughly to trouble jean valjean
sometimes he asked her what is the matter with you
she replied there is nothing the matter with me
and after a silence when she divined that he was sad also she would add and you father is there anything wrong with you
with me
nothing said he
these two beings who had loved each other so exclusively and with so touching an affection and who had lived so long for each other now suffered side by side each in the other's account without acknowledging it to each other without anger towards each other and with a smile
chapter viii the chain gang jean valjean was the more unhappy of the two
youth even in its sorrows always possesses its own peculiar radiance
at times jean valjean suffered so greatly that he became puerile
it is the property of grief to cause the childish side of man to reappear
he had an unconquerable conviction that cosette was dec a ping from him
he would have liked to resist to retain her to arouse her enthusiasm by some external and brilliant matter
these ideas puerile as we have just said and at the same time senior conveyed to him by their very childishness a tolerably just notion of the influence of gold lace on the imaginations of young girls
he once what cds to see a general on horseback in full uniform pass along thestreet.com he cougars the commandant of paris
he envied that gilded man what happiness it would be he said to himself if he could put on that suit which was an incontestable thing and if cosette could be told him thus she would be dazzled and when he had cosette on his arm and passed the fates of the tuileries the guard would present arms to him and that would suffice for cosette and would dispel her idea of looking at young men
an unforeseen shock was added to these sad reflections
in the isolated life which they led and since they had come to dwell in the fuel lumet they had contracted one habit
they sometimes took a pleasure trip to see the sunrise a mild species of enjoyment which before those who are entering life and those who are quitting it
for those who live solitude a walk in the early morning is equivalent to a stroll by night with the cheerfulness of nature added
the streets are deserted and the birds are singing
cosette a bird herself liked to rise early
these mary tonal excursions were planned on the preceding evening
he proposed and she agreed
it was arranged like a plot they set out before daybreak and these trips were so many small delights for cosette
these innocent eccentricities please young people
jean valjean's inclination led him as we have seen to the least frequented spots to solitary books to forgotten places
there then existed in the vicinity of the barriers of paris a sort of like meadows which were almost confounded with the city where grew in summer sickly grain and which in autumn after the harvest had been gathered presented the appearance not of having been reaped but peeled
jean valjean loved to haunt these fields
cosette was not bored there
it meant solitude to him and liberty roger
there she became a little girl once more she could run and almost play she took off her hat laid it on jean valjean's knees and gathered bunches of flowers
she gazed at the butterflies on the flowers but did not catch them gentleness and tenderness are born with love and the young girl who cherishes within her breasts trembling and fragile ideal has mercy on the wing of a butterfly
she wide garlands of poppies which she placed on her head and which crossed and penetrated with sunlight glowing until they blamed formed for her rosy face a crown of burning embers
even after their life had grown sad they kept up their custom of early strolls
one morning in october therefore tempted by the serene perfection of the autumn if they set out and found themselves at break of day near the barriers du maine
it was not dawn it was daybreak a delightful and stern moment
a few constellations here and there in the deep pale azure the earth all black the heavens all white aquifer amid the blades of grass everywhere the mysterious chill of twilight
alarm which seemed mingled with the stars qaeda rolling at a prodigious height and one would have declared that that hymn of pettiness calmed immensity
in the east the calder race projected its dark mass on the clear horizon with the sharpness of steel venus dazzlingly brilliant was rising behind that come and had the air of a soul making it's escape from a gloomy edifice
all was peace and silence there was no one on the road a few stray laborers of whom they caught barely a glimpse were on their way to their work along the side paths
jean valjean was sitting in a crosswalk on some plan is deposited at the gate of a timber yard
his face was turned towards the highway his back towards the light he had forgotten the sun which was on the point of rising he had sunk into one of those profound absorptions in which the mind becomes concentrated which imprison even the eye and which are equivalent to four walls
there are meditations which may be called vertical when one is at the bottom of them time is required to return to earth
jean valjean had plunged into one of these reveries
he was thinking of cosette of the maplin was that was possible if nothing came between him and her of the light with which she filled his life a light which was cut the emanation of her soul
he was almost happy in his're very
cosette who was standing beside him was gazing at the clouds as they turned rosy
all at once cosette exclaimed father i should think someone was coming yonder
jean valjean raised his eyes
cosette was right
the causeway which leads to the ancient barriere du maine is a prolongation as the reader knows of the rue de degree and is cut at right angles by the inner boulevard
at the elbow of the causeway and the boulevard at the spot where it branches they heard a noise which it was difficult to account for at that hour and a sort of confused pile made its appearance
some shapeless thing which was coming from the boulevard was turning into the road
it grew larger it seemed to move in an orderly manner though it was bristling and quivering it seemed to be a vehicle but its load could not be distinctly made out
there were horses wheels shouts ships were cracking
by degrees the outlines became fixed apr hough bathed in shadows
it was a vehicle in fact which has just turned from the boulevard into the highway and which was directing its course towards the barrier near which sat jean valjean a second of the same aspect followed then a third then a fourth seven chariots made their appearance in succession the heads of the horses touching the rear of the wagon in front
figures were moving on these vehicles flashes were visible through the disk as though there were naked sword's there a clanking became audible which resembled the rattling of chains and as this something advanced the sound of voices waxed louder and it turned into a terrible thing such as emerged from the card of dreams
as it drew nearer its way mrs a form and was outlined behind the trees with the pallid hue of an apparition the mass free white the day which was slowly dawning cast as an light on this swarming heap which was at once both sepulchral and living the heads of the figures turned into the faces of corpses and this is what it proved to be seven wagons were driving in a file along the road
the first six were singularly constructed
they resembled cooper's's rays they consisted of long ladders placed on two wheels and forming barrows at their rear extremities
each drag or rather let us say each ladder was attached to four horses harnessed tandem
on these ladders strange clusters of men were being drawn
in the faint light these men were to be divine'd rather than seen
twenty four on each vehicle twelve on aside back to back facing the passers by their legs dangling in the air this was the manner in which these men were travelling and behind their backs they had something which flanked and which was a chain and on their necks something which shone and which was an iron collar
each man had his collar but the chain was for all so that if these four and twenty men had occasion to a light from the drag and walk they were seized with a sort of inexorable unity and were obliged to wind over the ground with the chain for a backbone somewhat after the fashion of mill specs
in the back and front of each vehicle two men armed with muskets stood erect each holding one end of the chain under his foot
the iron necklets were square
the seventh vehicle a huge rack sided baggage wagon without a good had four wheels and six horses and carried a sonorous pile of iron boilers cast iron pot's frazier's and chains among which were mingled several men who were pink ones and stretched at full length and who seemed to brill
this way of all lattice work was garnished with dilapidated hurdles which appeared to have served for former punishments
these vehicles kept to the middle of the road
on each side marched a double hedge of guards of infamous aspect wearing three corners what's like the soldiers under the directory shabby covered with spots and holes muffled in uniforms of veterans and the trousers of undertaker's' men half gray hair blue which were almost hanging in rats with red epaulets yellow shoulder belts short sabres muskets and cudgels they were a species of soldier black guards
these myrmidon's seemed composed of the abject ness of the beggar and the authority of the executioner
the one who appeared to be their chief held a postilion's whip in his hand
all these details blurred by the dimness of dawn became more and more clearly outlined as the light increased
at the head and in the rear of the convoy rode mounted gendarmes serious and with sword in fish
this procession was so long that when the first vehicle reached the barrier the last was barely web sucking from the boulevard
a throng sprung it is impossible to saga hence and formed in a twinkling as is frequently the case in paris pressed forward from both sides of the road and looked on
in the neighboring lanes the shouts of people calling to eachother and the wooden shoes of market garden eye hastening up to gaze were audible
the men masses upon the drays allowed themselves to be jolted along in silence
they were livid with the chill of morning
they all wore linen trousers and their bare feet were thrust into wooden shoes
the rest of their costume was a fantasy of wretchedness
their accoutrements were horribly incongruous nothing is no refund real than the harlequin in rags
battered felt hats tarpaulin caps hideous woollen night caps and side by side with a short blouses black coat broken at the elbow many word women's head gear others had baskets on their heads hairy breasts were visible and through the rent in their garments tattooed designs could be descried temples of love fleming hearts clouds eruptions and unhealthy red blotches could also be seen
two or three had a straw rope attached to the crossbar of the drag and suspended under them like a stirrup which supported their feet
one of them held on his hand and raised to his mouth something which had the appearance of a blackstone and which he seemed to be gnawing it was bread which he was eating
there were no eyes there which were not either dry duplex or flaming with an evil light
the escort troop cursed the men in chains did not utter a syllable from time to time the sound of a blow became audible as the cudgels descended on shoulder blades or skills some of these men were yawning their rats were terrible their feet hung down their shoulders oscillated their heads clashed together their betters flanked their eyes glared ferociously their fists clenched or fell open inert it like the hands of corpses in the rear of the convoy data band of children screaming with laughter
this file of vehicles whatever its nature was was mournful
it was evident that tomorrow that an hour hence a pouring rain might descend that it might be followed by another and another and that their dilapidated garments would be drenched that once soaked these men would not get dry again that once chilled they would not again get warn that their linen trousers would be glued to their bones by the downpour that the water would fill their shows that no lashes from the ships would be able to prevent their jaws from chattering that the chain would continue to find them by the neck that their legs would continue to dangle and it was impossible not to shudder at the sight of these human beings this bound and passive beneath the fold clouds of autumn and we kindred over to the rain to the blast to all the duties of the air like trees and stones
blows from the cudgel were not omitted even in the case of the sick men who lay there knotted with ropes and motionless on the seventh wagon and who appeared to have been tossed there like sacks filled with misery
suddenly the sun made its appearance the immense light of the orient burst forth and one would have said that it has set fire to all those ferocious heads
their tongues were in loosed a conflagration of grins oaths and songs exploded
the broad horizontal sheet of light severed the file in two parts illuminating heads and bodies leading feet and wheels in the obscurity
thoughts made their appearance on these faces it was a terrible moment visible demons with their masks removed fierce souls laid bare
though lighted up this wild throng remained in bloom
some who were gay had in their mouths skills through which they blew vermin over the crowd picking out the women the dawn accentuated these lamentable php files with the blackness of its shadows there was not one of these creatures who was not deformed by reason of wretchedness and the whole was so monstrous that one would have said that the sun's brilliancy had been changed into the glare of the lightning
the wagon loss which headed the line had struck up a song and were shouting at the top of their voices with a haggard jovial it is potpourri by desai tiers then famous called the vestal the trees shivered mournfully in the cross lanes countenances of bourgeois listened in an idiotic delight to these coarse strains droned by spectres
all sorts of distress men in this profession as in chaos here were to be found the facial angles of every sort of beast old men youths bald head's gray beard's cynical monstrosities sour resignation savage grins senseless attitudes about a surmounted by caps heads like those of young girls with corkscrew curls on the temples infantile visages and by reason of that horrible thin skeleton faces to which death alone was lacking
on the first cart was a negro who had been a slave in all probability and who could make a comparison of his chains
the frightful leveller from below aha he had passed over these browser that degree of a basement the last transformations were suffered by all in their extreme at depths and ignorance converted into fulness was the equal of intelligence converted into despair
there was no choice possible between these men who appeared to the eye as the flower of the mud
it was evident that the person who had had the ordering of that unclean procession had not classified them
these beings had been better evans couple do all hell in alphabetical disorder probably and loaded haphazard on those carts
nevertheless horrors when grouped together always end by evolving a result all additions of wretched men give a sum total each chain exhaled a common soul and each drag load had its own physiognomy
by the side of the one where they were sitting there was one where they were howling a third where they were begging one could be seen in which they were gnashing their teeth another load menaced the spectators another blasphemed god the last was as silent as the tomb
dante would have thought that he beheld his seven circles of hell of the march
the march of the damned to their tortures performed in sinister wise not on the formidable and flaming chariot of the apocalypse but what was more mournful than that in the gibbet cart
one of the guards who had a book on the end of his cudgel made a pretence from time to time of stirring up this mass of human filth
an old woman in the crowd pointed them out to her little boy five years old and said to him rascal let that be a warning to you
as the songs and blasphemies increased the man who appeared to be the captain of the escort cracked his whip and at that signal a fearful dull and blind blogging which produced the sound of mail fell upon the seven drag loads many roared and foamed at the mouth which we doubled the delight of the street urchin's who had hastened up a swarm of flies on these wounds
jean valjean's eyes had assumed a frightful expression
they were no longer eyes they were those deep and glassy objects which replace the glance in the case of certain wretched men which seem unconscious of reality and in which flames the reflection of terrors and of catastrophes
he was not looking at a spectacle he was seeing a vision
he tried to rise to flee to make his escape he could not move his feet
sometimes the things that you see seize upon you and hold you east
he remained nailed to the spot petrified stupid asking himself at heart confused and inexpressible anguish what this sepulchral persecution dignified and whence had come that pandemonium which was pursuing him
all at once he raised his hand to his brow a gesture habitual to those who ce memory suddenly returns he remembered that this was in fact the usual itinerary that it was customary to make this detour in order to avoid all possibility of encountering royalty on the road to fontainebleau and that five and thirty years before he had himself passed through that barrier
code free as no less terrified but in a different way
she did not understand what she beheld did not seem to her to be possible at length she cried father
what are those men in those carts
jean valjean replied convicts
whither are they going
to the galleys
at that moment the cudgel long multiplied by a hundred hands became zealous blows with the flag of the sword were mingled with it it was a perfect storm of whips and clubs the convicts bent before it a hideous obedience was evoked by the torture and all held their peace darting glances like chained wolves
cosette trembled in every limb she resumed father are they still men
sometimes answered the unhappy man
it was the chain gang in fact which has set out before daybreak from god etre and had taken the road romans in order to avoid fontainebleau where the king then was
this caused the horrible journey to last three or four days longer but torture may surely be prolonged with the object of sparing the royal personages sight of it
jean valjean returned home utterly overwhelmed
suchen count ers are shocks and the memory that they leave behind them resembles a thorough shaking up
nevertheless jean valjean did not observe that on his way back to the rue de babylone with cosette the latter was plying him with other questions on the subject of what they had just seen perhaps he was too much absorbed in his own rejection to notice her words and reply to them
but when cosette was leaving him in the evening to be take herself to bed he heard her way in a low voice and as though talking to herself it seems to me that if i were to find one of those men in my pathway oh my god i should die merely from the sight of him close at hand
fortunately chance ordained that on the morrow of that tragic day there was some official solemnity apropos of i know not what fetes in paris a review in the champ de mars joists on the seine theatrical performances in the champs elysees fireworks at the arc del' etoile illuminations everywhere
jean valjean did violence to his habits and took cosette to see these rejoicing's for the purpose of diverting her from the memory of the day before and of effacing beneath the smiling tumult of all paris the abominable thing which had passed before her
the review with which the festival was spiced made the presence of uniforms perfectly natural jean valjean donned his uniform of a national guard with the vague inward feeling of a man who is be taking himself to shelter
how ever this trip seemed to attain its object
cosette who had either law to please her father and to whom moreover all spectacles were a novelty accepted this diversion with the light and easy good grace of youth and did not pour too disdainful list that flutter of enjoyment called a public gets so that jean valjean was able to believe that he had succeeded and that no trace of that hideous vision remained
some days later one morning when the sun was shining brightly and they were both on the steps leading to the garden another infraction of the rules which jean valjean seemed to have imposed upon himself and to the custom of remaining in her chamber which melancholy had caused cosette to adopt cosette in a wrapper was standing erect in that he vii men fat tire or early morning which envelope young girls in an adorable day and which produces the effect of a cloud drawn over a star and with her head bathed in light rosy after a good sleep submitting to the gentle glances of the tender old man she was picking a daisy to pieces
cosette did not know the delightful legend i love a little passionate py etc.
who was there who could have taught her
she was handling the flower instinctively innocently without a suspicion that to lluvia daisy a part is to do the same by a heart
if there were a fourth and smiling trace called melancholy she would have worn the air of that grace
jean valjean was fascinated by the contemplation of those tiny fingers on that flower and forgetful of everything in the radiance emitted by that child
aged breast was warbling in the thicket on one side
white cloud lets floated across the sky so gayly that one would have said that they had just been set at liberty
cosette went on attentively tearing the leaves from her flowers he seemed to be thinking about something but whatever it was it must be something charming all at once she turned her head over her shoulder with the delicate languor of asean and said to jean valjean father what are the galleys like
book fourth
succor from below may turn out to be succor from kb high chapter is wound without healing within thus their life clouded over by degrees
but one diversion which had formerly been a happiness remained to them which was to carry great to those who were hungry and clothing to those who were sold
cosette often accompanied jean valjean on these visits to the poor in which they recovered some remnants of their former free intercourse and sometimes when the day had been a good one and they had assisted many in distress and cheered and warmed many little children cosette was rather merry in the evening
it was at this epoch that they paid their visit to the jon dee the den
on the day following that visit jean valjean made his appearance in the pavilion in the morning call as was his wont but with a large wound on his left arm which was much inflamed and very angry which resembled a burn and which he explained in some way or other
this sound resulted in his being detained in the house for a month with fever
he would not call in a doctor
when cosette urged him call the dog doctor said he
cosette dressed the wound morning and evening with so divine an air and such angelic happiness at being of use to him that jean valjean felt all his former you're turning his fears and anxieties dissipating and he gazed at cosette saying oh
what a kindly sound
oh
what a good misfortune
cosette on perceiving that her father was ill had deserted the pavilion and again taken a fancy to the little lodging and the back courtyard
she passed nearly all her days beside jean valjean and rear to him the books which he desired
generally they were books of travel
jean valjean was undergoing a new birth his happiness was revising in these ineffable rays the luxembourg the prowling young stranger cosette's coldness all these clouds upon his soul were growing dim
he had reached the point where he said to himself i imagined all that
i am an old book
his happiness was so great that the horrible discovery of the the barriers made in the job brett shovel unexpected as it was bad after a fashion glides over him unnoticed
he had succeeded in making his escape all trace of him was lost what more dishes are for
he only yn ought of those wretched beings to pity them
here they are in prison and henceforth they will be incapacitated for doing any harm he thought but what a lamentable family in distress
as for the hideous vision of the barriers du maine cosette had not referred to it again
sister's son reject tilde had taught cosette music in the convent cosette had the voice of a linnet with a soul and sometimes in the evening in the wounded man's humble abode and warbler melancholy songs which delighted jean valjean
spring came the garden was so delightful at that season of the year that mean value aj said to cosette you never got here i want you to stroll in it
as you like father said cosette
and for the sake of obeying her father she resumed her walks in the garden generally alone for as we have mentioned jean valjean who was probably afraid of being seen through the fence hardly ever went there
jean valjean's wound had created a diversion
when cosette saw that her father was suffering less that he was convalescing and that he appeared to be happy she experienced a contentment which she did not even perceive so gently and naturally had it to me
then it was in the month of march the days were growing longer the winter was departing the winter always bears away with its portion of our sadness then came april that daybreak of summer fresh as dawn always is gay like every childhood a little inclined to weep at times like the newborn being that it is
in that month nature has charming gleams which pass from the sky from the trees from the meadows and the flowers into the heart of man
cosette was still too young to escape the penetrating influence of that aprilioy which bore so strong a resemblance to herself
in sensibly and without her suspecting the fact the blackness depart ew from her spirit
in spring dad would grow light as light falls into cellars at midday
cosette was no longer sad
however though this was so she did not account for it to herself
in the morning about teno'clock after breakfast when she had succeeded in enticing her father into the garden for a quarter of an hour and when she was pacing up and down in the sunlight in front of the steps supporting his left arm for him she did not perceive that she laughed every moment and that she was happy
jean valjean intoxicated be held her growing fresh and rory once more
oh
what a good sound
he repeated in a whisper
and he felt grateful to the the barriers
his wound once healed he resumed his solitary twilight strolls
it is a mistake to suppose that a person can stroll alone in that fashion in the uninhabited regions of paris without meeting with some adventure
chapter ii mother l lutar she finds no difficulty in explaining a phenomenon one evening little gave if he had had nothing to eat he remembered that he had not dined on the preceding day either this was becoming tiresome
he resolved to make an effort to secure some supper
he strolled out beyond the sql petrie're into deserted regions that is where windfalls are to be found where there is no one one always finds something
he reached a settlement which appeared to him to be the village of austerlitz
in one of his preceding lounge she had noticed there an old garden haunted by an old man and an old woman and in that gardens passable apple tree
beside the apple tree stood a sort of fruit house which was not securely fastened and where one might contrive to get an apple
one apple is a supper one apple is life
that which was adam's ruin might prove had roche's salvation
the garden abutted on a solitary unpaved lane bordered with brushwood while awaiting the arrival of houses the garden was separated from it by a hedge
gav roche directed his steps towards this garden he found the land he recognized the apple tree be verified the fruit house he examined the hedge a hedge means merely one stride
the day was declining there was not even a cat in the land the hour was propitious
gav roche began the operation of scaling the hedge then suddenly paused
someone was talking in the garden
gav roche pee pee through one of the breaks in the hedge
illustrations utc it from below b succor from below a couple of paces distant at the foot of the hedge on the other side exactly at the point where the gap which he was meditating would have been made there was a sort of recumbent stone which formed a bench and on this bench was seated the old man of the garden while the old woman was standing in front of him
the old woman was grumbling
gav roche who was not very discreet listened
monsieur man eur
said the old woman
have hf
thought had roche that name is a perfect farce
the old man who was thus addressed did not stir
the old woman repeated monsieur man eur
the old man without raising his eyes from the ground made up his mind to answer what is it mother plug atque
motif to lutar que
thought gev roche another farcical name
mother pour se que began again and the old man was forced to accept the conversation the landlord is not pleased
why
we use three quarters rent
in three months we shall owe him for four quarters
he says that he will then you out to sleep
i will go
the greengrocer insists on being paid
she will no longer leave here shots
what will you warm yourself with this digger
we shall have no wood
there is the sun
the butcher refuses to give credit he will not let us have any more meat
that is quite right
i do not digest meat well
it is too heavy
what shall we have for dinner
bread
the baker demands a settlement and says' no money no bread
' that is well
what will you eat
we have apples in the apple room
but monsieur decan't live like that without money
i have none
the old woman went away the old man remained alone
he fell into thought
gav roche became thoughtful also
it was almost dark
the first result of bad roche's meditation was that instead of scaling the hedge he crouched down under it
the branches stood apart a little at the foot of the thicket
so he exclaimed gatto che mentally here's a book
and he curled up in it
his back was almost in contact with father have it's bench
he could hear the octogenarian breathe
then by way of dinner he tried to sleep
it was a cat nap with one eye open
while he dozed gave if he kept on the watch
the twilight pallor of the sky blanched the earth and the land formed a livid line between two rows of dark bushes
all at once in this whitish band two figures made their appearance
one was in front the other some distance in the rear
the refine two creatures muttered had roche
the first form seemed to be some elderly bourgeois who was bent and thoughtful dressed more than plainly and who was walking slowly because of his age and strolling about in the open evening air
the second was straight firms lender
it regulated it space by that of the first but in the voluntary slowness of its fair suppleness and agility were discernible
this figure had also something fierce and disquieting about it the whole shape was that of what was then called an elegant the harass of good shape the cost blackwell cut probably of fine cloth and well fitted in at the waist
the head was held erect with a sort of robust grace and beneath them at the pale profile of a young man could be made out in the dim light
the profile had arose in its mouth
this second form was well known for abroche it was montparnasse
he could have told nothing about the other except that he was a respectable old man
fabric he immediately began to take observations
one of these two pedestrians evidently had a project connected with the other
fabric he was well placed to watch the course of events
the bedroom has turned into a hiding place at a very opportune moment
montparnasse on the hunt at such an hour in such a place get our new something threatening
fabric he felt his gamin's heart moved with compassion for the old man
what was metodo
interfere
one weakness coming to the aid of another
it would be merely a laughing matter for montparnasse
gav roche did not shut his eyes to the fact that the old man in the first place and the child in the second would make but two mouthfuls for that redoubtable ruffian eighteen years of age
while gave if he was deliberating the attack took place abruptly and hideously
the attack of the tiger on the wild ass the attack of the spider in the fly
montparnasse suddenly tossed away his rose founded upon the old man seized him by the collar grasped and clung to him and gev roche with difficulty restrained a scream
a moment later one of these men was underneath the other groaning struggling with a knee if marble upon his breast
only it was not just what gave if he had expected
the one who lay on the earth was montparnasse the one who was on top was the old man
all this took place a few paces distant from nav roche
the old man had received the shock had returned it and that in such a terrible fashion that in a twinkling the assailant and the assailed had exchanged roles
here's a hearty veteran
thought had roche
he could not refrain from clapping his hands
but it was applause wasted
it did not reach the combatants absorbed and deafened as they were each by the other as their breath mingled in the struggle
silence ensued
montparnasse ceased his struggles
gav roche indulged in this aside can be be dead
the good man had not uttered a word nor given vent to a cry
he rose to his feet and gave if he heard him say to montparnasse get up
montparnasse ross but the good man held him fast
montparnasse's attitude was the humiliated and furious attitude of the wolf who has been caught by a sheep
yafro she looked on and listened making an effort to reinforce his eyes with his ears
he was enjoying himself immensely
he was repaid for his conscientious anxiety in the character of a spectator
he was able to catch on the wing a dialogue which borrowed from the darkness an indescribably tragic accent
the good man questioned montparnasse replies
how old are you
nineteen
you are strong and healthy
why do you not work
it bores me
what is your trade
an idler
speak seriously
can anything be done for you
what would you like to be
a thief
a pause ensued
the old man seemed absorbed in profound thought
he stood motionless and did not relax his hold on montparnasse
every moment the vigorous and agile young ruffian indulged in the twitching spec wild beast caught in a snare
he gave a jerk tried a crook of the knee twisted his limbs desperately and made efforts to escape
the old man did not appear to notice it and held both his arms with one hand with the sovereign indifference of absolute force
the old man's're very lasted for some time then looking steadily at montparnasse be addressed to him in a gentle voice in the midst of the darkness where they stood a solemn harangue of which gave if he did not lose a single syllable my child you are entering through indolence on one of the most laborious of lives

the dungeon
there is your future
what precipices are idleness and pleasure
do you know that to do nothing is a melancholy resolution
to live in idleness on the property of society
to be useless that is to say pernicious
this leads straight to the depth of wretchedness
woe to the man who desires to be a parasite
he will become vermin
ah
so it does not please you to work
ah

you will be a wood poussin a cellar
ah
have pity on yourself you miserable young child who were sucking at nurse less than twenty years ago and who have no doubt another still alive
i conjure you listen to me i entreat you
you desire fine black cloth varnished shoes to have your hair curled and sweet smelling oils on your locks to please low women to be handsome
you will be shaven clean and you will wear a few blouse and wooden shoes
you want rings on your fingers you will have an iron necklet on your neck
if you glance at a woman you will receive a blow
and you will enter there at the age of twenty
and you will come out at fifty
you will enter young rosy fresh with brilliant eyes and all your white teeth and your handsome youthful hair you will come out broken bent wrinkled toothless horrible with white locks
ah
my poor child you are on the wrong road idleness is counselling you badly the hardest of all work is thieving
believe me do not undertake that painful profession of an idle man
it is not comfortable to become a rascal
it is less disagreeable to be an honest man
now go and ponder on what i have said to you
by the way what did you want of me
my purse
here it is
and the old man releasing montparnasse put his purse in the latter's hand montparnasse weighed it for a moment after which he allowed it to slide gently into the back pocket of his coat with the same mechanical precaution as though he had stolen it
all this having been said and done the good man turned his back and tranquilly resumed his stroll
the blockhead
muttered montparnasse
who was this goodman
the reader has no doubt already divined
montparnasse watched him with amazement as he disappeared in the dusk
this contemplation was fatal to him
while the old man was walking away gave if he drew near
gav roche had assured himself with a sidelong glance that rather have it was still sitting on his bench probably sound asleep
then the gamin emerged from his thicker and began to crawl after king par nasse in the dark as the latter stood there motionless
in this manner he came up to montparnasse without being seen or heard gently insinuated his hand into the back pocket pc that frock coat of fine black cloth seized the purse withdrew his hand and having recourse once more to his crawling he slipped away like an added through the shadows
hong larnaca f who had no reason to be on his guard and who was engaged in thought for the first time in his life perceived nothing
when gave if he had once more attained the point where rather have ideas he flung the purse over the hedge and fled as fast as his legs would carry him
the purse fell on father have it's foot
this commotion roused him
he bent over and picked up the purse
he did not understand in the least and opened it
the purse had two compartments in one of them there was some small change in the other lay six napoleon's

book fifth
the end of which does not resemble the beginning chapter i solitude and the barracks combined cosette's grief which had been so poignant and lively tour of five months previously had without her being conscious of the fact entered upon its convalescence
nature spring youth love for her father the gayety of the birds and flowers caused something almost resembling forgetfulness to filter gradually drop by drop into that soul which was so virgin and so young
was the fire wholly extinct there
it was it merely that layers of ashes had formed
the truth is that she hardly felt the painful and burning spot any longer
one day she suddenly thought of marius why
said she i no longer think of him
that same week she noticed a very handsome officer of lancers with a wasp like waist a delicious unicorn the cheeks of a young girls sword under his arms axed mustaches and a glazed schalk a passing the gate
moreover he had light hair prominent blue eyes around face was vain insolent and good looking quite the reverse of marius
he had a cigar in his mouth
cosette thought that this officer doubtless belonged to the regiment in barracks in the rue de babylone
on the following day she saw him pass again
she took note of them out
from that time for the as it chance
she saw him pass nearly every day
the officer's comrades perceived that there was in that badly kept garden behind that malicious dovico fence a very pretty creature who was almost always there when the handsome lieutenant who is not unknown to the reader and whose name was the ovule ville norm and passed by
see here
they said to himthere'sa little creature there who is making eyes at you look
have i. the time replied the lancer to look at all the girls who look at me
this was at the precise moment when marius was descend inn heavily toward a agony and was saying if i could but see her before i die
had his wish been realized had he beheld cosette at that moment gazing at the lancer he would not have been able to utter a word and he would have expired with grief
whose fault was it
no one's
marius possessed one of those temperaments which bury them selves in sorrow and there abide cosette was one of those persons who plunge into sorrow and emerge from it again
cosette was moreover passing through that dangerous period the fatal phase of feminine're very abandoned to itself in which the isolated heart of a young girl resembles the tendrils of the vine which cling as chance directs to the capital of a marble column or to the list of a wine shops rapid and decisive moment critical for every orphan be cherish it poor for wealth does not prevent a bad choice his alliances are made in very high circles realm is alliance is that of souls and as many an unknown young man without name without birth without fortune is a marble column which bears up a temple of grand sentiments and grand ideas so such and such a man of the world satisfied and opulent who has polished boots and varnished words it looked at not outside but inside a thing which is reserved for his wife is nothing more than a block obscurely haunted by violent unclean and vinous passions the list of a drinking shop
what did cosette's soul contain
passion calmed or lulled to sleep something limpid brilliant troubled to a certain depth and gloomy lower down
the image of the handsome officer was reflected in the surface
did a souvenir linger in the depths
quite at the bottom
possibly
cosette did not know
a singular incident super've had
chapter ii cosette's apprehensions during the first fortnight in april jean valjean took a journey
this as the reader knows happened from time to time at very long intervals
he remained absent a day or two days at the utmost
where did he go
no one knew not even cosette
once only on the occasion of one of these departures she had accompanied him in a hackney coach as far as a little blind alley at the corner of which she read impasse de la planche the
there be a lighted and the coach took cosette back to the rue de babylone
it was usually when money was lacking in the house that jean valjean took these little trips
so jean valjean was absent
he had said i shall return in three days
that evening cosette was alone in the drawing room
in order to get rid of her ennui she had opened her piano organ and had begun to sing accompanying herself the while the chorus from sufyan the hunters astray in the wood
which is probably the most beautiful thing in all the sphere of music
when she had finished she remained wrapped in thought
all at once it seemed to her that she hears the sound of footsteps in the garden
it could not be her father he was absent it could not be toussaint she was in bed and it was teno'clock at night
she stepped to the shutter of the drawing room which was closed and laid her ear against it
it seemed to her that it was the tread of a man and that he was walking very softly
she mounted rapidly to the first floor to her own chamber opened a small wicker in her shutter and peeped into the garden
the moon was at the full
everything could be seen as plainly as by day
there was no one there
she opened the window
the garden was absolutely calm and all that was visible was that the street was deserted as usual
cosette thought that she had been mistaken
she thought that she had heard a noise
it was a hallucination produced by the melancholy and magnificent chorus of weber which lays open before the kind terrified depths which trembles before the gaza like a dizzy forest and in which one hears the crackling of dead branches beneath the uneasy tread of the huntsmen of whom one catches a glimpse through the twilight
she thought no more about it
moreover cosette was not very timid by nature
there flowed in her veins some of the blood of the bohemian and the adventuress who runs barefoot
it will be remembered that she was more ocala fl than a dove
there was a foundation of wildness and bravery in her
on the following day at an earlier your towards nightfall she was strolling in the garden
in the midst of the confused thoughts which occupied her she fancied that she caught for an instant a sound similar to that of the preceding evening as though someone were walking beneath the trees in the dusk and not very far from her but she told herself that nothing so closely resembles a step on the grass as the friction of two branches which have moved from side to side and she laid no need to it
besides she could see nothing
she emerged from the thicket she had still to cross a small lawn to regain the steps
the moon which had just risen behind her cast cosette's shadow in front of her up on this is an as she came out from the shrubbery
cosette halted in alarm
beside her shadow the moon outlined distinct it upon the turf another shadow which was particularly startling and terrible a shadow which had around hst
it was the shadow of a man who must have been standing on the border of the clump of shrubbery a few paces in the rear of cosette
she stood for a moment without the power to speak of cry or call or stor or turn her head
then she summoned up all her courage and turned round resolutely
there was no one there
she glanced on the ground
the figure had disappeared
where entered the thicket searched the corners boldly went as far as the gate and found nothing
she felt herself absolutely chilled with terror
was this another hallucination
what
two days in succession
one hallucination might pass but two hallucinations
the disquieting point about it was that the shadow had assuredly not been a phantom
phantoms do not wear round bats
on the follo wing day jean valjean returned
cosette told him what she thought she had heard and seen
she wanted to be reassured and to see her father shrug his shoulders and say to her you are a little goose
jean valjean grew anxious
it can not be anything said he
he left her under some pretext and went into the garden and she saw him examining the gate with great attention
during the night she woke up this time she was sure and she distinctly heard someone walking close to the flug nr of steps beneath her window
she ran to her little wicket and opened it
in point of fact there was a man in the garden with a large club in his hand
just as she was about to scream the moon lighted up the man's profile
it was her father
she returned to her bed saying to herself he is very uneasy
jean valjean passed that night and the two succeeding nights in the garden
cosette saw him through the hole in her shutter
on the third night the moon was on the wage and had begun to rise later at oneo'clock in the morning possibly she heard a loud burst of laughter and her father's voice calling her cosette
she jumped out of bed threw on her dressing gown and poems dhfr window
her father was standing on the grass plot below
i have wakes you for the purpose of reassuring you said he look there is your shadow with the round hat
and he pointed out to her on the turf a shadow cast by the moon and which did indeed bear considerable resemblance to the spectre of a man wearing around hat
it was the shadow produced by a chimney pile of sheet iron with a good which rose above a neighboring roof
cosette joined in his laughter all her lugubrious suppositions were all ages and the next morning as she was at breakfast with her father she made merry over the sinister garden haunted by the shadows of iron chimney pots
jean valjean became quite tranquil once more as for cosette she did not pay much attention to the question whether the chimney pot was really in the direction of the shadow which she had seen or thought she had seen and whether the moon had been in the same spot in the sky
she did not question herself as to the peculiarity of a chimney pot which is afraid of being caught in the act and which retires when someone looks at its shadow for the shadow had taken the alarm when cosette had turned round and cosette had thought herself very sure of this
cosette's serenity was fully restored
the proof appeared to her to be complete and it quite banished from her mind whether there could possibly be anyone walking in the garden during the evening or at night
a few days later however a fresh incident occurred
chapter iii enriched with commentaries by toussaint in the garden near the railing on the street there was a stone bench screened from the eyes of the curious by a plantation of your elms but which could in case of necessity be reached by an arm from the outside past the trees and the gate
one evening during that same month of april jean valjean had gone out cosette had seated herself on this bench after sundown
the breeze was blowing briskly in the trees cosette was meditating an object less sadness was taking possession of her little by little that invincible sadness evoked by the evening and which arises perhaps who knows from the mystery of the tomb which is a jar at that hour
perhaps can tune was within that shadow
rosette rose slowly made the tour of the garden walking on the grass drench fri brew and saying to herself through the species of melancholy donna m. bullsh in which she was plunged e sally one needs wooden shoes for the garden at this hour
one takes cold
she returned to the bench
as she was about to resume her seat there she observed on the spot which she had quitted a tolerably large stone which had evidently not been there a moment before
cosette gazed at the stone asking herself what it meant
all at once the idea occurred to her that the stone had not reached the bench all by itself that someone had placed it there that an arm had been thrust through the railing and this idea appeared to alarm her
this time the fear was genuine the stone was there
no doubt was possible she did not touch it fled without glancing behind her took refuge in the house and immediately closed with shutter bolt and bar the door like window opening on the flight of steps
she inquired of toussaint has my father returned yet
not yet mademoiselle
we have already noted once for all the fact that toussaint stuttered
may we be permitted to dispense with it for the future
the musical notation of an infirmity is repugnant to us
jean valjean a thoughtful man and given to nocturnal strolls often returned quite late at night
toussaint went on rosette are you careful to thoroughly barricade the shutters opening on the garden at least with bars in the evening and to put the little or on things in the little rings that close them
oh
be easy on that score miss
toussaint did not fail in her duty and cosette was well aware of the fact but she could not refrain from adding it is so solitary here
so far as that is concerned said toussaint it is true
we might be assassinated before we had time to say out
and monsieur does not sleep in the house to boot
but fear nothing miss i fasten the shutters up like prisons
lone women
that is enough to make one shudder i believe you
just imagine what if you were to see men enter your chamber at night and say' hold your tongue
' and begin to cut your throat
it's not the dying so much you die for one must die and that's allright it's the abomination of feeling those people touch you
and then their knives theycan't be able to cut well with them
ah good gracious
be quiet said cosette
fasten everything thoroughly
cosette terrified by the melodrama improvised by toussaint and possibly also by the recollection of the apparitions of the past week which recurred to her memory dared not even day to her go and look at the stone which has been placed on the bench
for fear of opening the garden gate and allowing the men to enter
she saw that all the doors and windows were carefully fastened made toussaint to all over the house from garret to cellar locked herself up in her own chamber bolted her door looked under her couch went to bed and slept badly
all night long she saw that big stone as large as a mountain and full of caverns
at sunrise the property of the rising sun is to make us laugh at all our terrors of the last night and our laughter is in direct proportion to our terror which they have caused at sunrise cosette when she woke viewed here right as a nightmare and said to herself what have i been thinking of
it is like the footsteps that i thought i heard a week or two ago in the garden at night
it is like the shadow of the chimney pot
ami becoming a coward
the sun which was flowing through the crevices in her shutters and turning the damask curtains crimson reassured her to such an extent that everything vanished from her thoughts even the stone
there was no more as gone on the bench than there was a man in around hat in the garden i dreamed about the stone as i did all the rest
she dressed herself descended to the garden ran to the bench and broke out in a cold perspiration
the stone was there
buy this lasted only for a moment
that which is terror by night is curiosity by day
bah
said she come let us see what it is
she lifted the stone which was tolerably large
beneath it was something which resembled a letter
it was a white envelope
cosette seized it
there was no address on one side no deal on the other
get the envelope though unsealed was not empty
papers could be seen inside
cosette examined it
it was no longer alarm it was no longer curiosity it was a beginning of anxiety
cosette drew from the envelope its contents a little notebook of paper each page of which was numbered and bore a few lines in a very fine and rather pretty handwriting as cosette thought
cosette looked for a name there was none
to whom was this addressed
to her probably since a hand had deposited the packet on her bench
from whom did it come
an irresistible fascination took possession of her she tried to turn away her eyes from the leaflets which were trembling in math and she gazed at the sky the street the acacia's all bathed in light the pigeons fluttering over a neighboring role and then her glance suddenly fell upon the manuscript and she said to herself that she must know what it contained
this is what she read
chapter iv a heart beneath a stone illustration cosette with letter b cosette after letter the reduction of the universe to a single being the expansion of a single being even to god that is live
love is the salutation of the angels to the stars
how sad is the soul when it is sad through love
what avoid in the absence of the being who by herself alone fills the world
oh
how true it is that the beloved being become a god
one could comprehend that god might be jealous of this had not for the father of all evidently made creation for the soul and the soul for love
the glimpse of a smile beneath a white craps bonnet with a lilac curtain is sufficient to cause the soul to enter into the palace of dreams
god is behind everything but everything hideshow
things are black creatures are opaque
to loves being is to render that being transparent
certain thoughts are prayers
there are moments when whatever the attitude of the body may be the soul is on its knees
parted lovers beguile absence by a thousand chimerical devices which possess however a reality of their own
they are prevented from seeing each other they can not write to each other they discover a multitude of mysterious means to cortez pond
they send eachother the song of the birds the perfume of the flowers the smiles of children the light of the sun the signings of the breeze the rays of stars all creation
and why not
all the works of god are made to serve love
love is sufficiently potent to charge all nature with its messages
in spring
thou art a letter that i write to her
the future belongs to hearts even more than it does to minds
love that is the only thing that can occupy and fill eternity
in the infinite the inexhaustible is requisite
love participates of the soul itself
it is of the same nature
like it it is the divine spark like it it is incorruptible indivisible imperishable
it is a point of fire that exists within us which is immortal and infinite which no thing can combine and which nothing can extinguish
we feel it burning even to the very narrow of our bones and we see it beaming in the very depths of heaven
oh love
adoration s
voluptuousness of two minds which understand each other of two hearts which exchange with each other of two glances which penetrate each other
you will come to me will you got bliss
strolls by twos in the solitudes
blessed and radiant days
i have sometimes dreamed that from time to time hours detached themselves from the lives of the angels and came here below to traverse the destinies of men
god can add nothing to the happiness of those who love except to give them endless duration
after a life of love an eternity of love is in fact an augmentation but to increase in intensity even the ineffable felicity which love bestows on the soul even in this world is impossible even to god
god is the plenitude of heaven love is the plenitude of man
you look at a start of two reasons because it is luminous and because it is impenetrable
you have beside you a sweeter radiance and a greater mystery woman
all of us whoever we may behave our respirable beings
we lack air and we stifle
the needle
to die for lack of love is horrible
suffocation of the soul
when love has fused and mingled two beings in a sacred and angelic unity the secret of life has been discovered so far as they are concerned they are no longer anything more than the two boundaries of the same destiny they are no longer anything but the two wings of the same spirit
love soar
on the day when a woman as she passes before you emits light as she walks you are lost you love
but one thing remains for you to do to think of her so intently that she is constr aimed to think of you
what love commences can be finished by god alone
true love is in despair and is enchanted over a glove lost or a handkerchief found and eternity is required for its devotion and its hopes
it is composed both of the infinitely great and the infinitely little
if you are a stone be adamant if you are a plant be the sensitive plant if you are a man veloce
nothing suffices for love
we have happiness we desire paradise we possess paradise we desire heaven
oh yeah i love each other all this is contained in love
understand how to find it there
love has contemplation as well as heaven and more than heaven it has voluptuousness
does she still come to the luxembourg
no sur
this is the church where she attends mass is it not
she no longer comes here
does she still live in this house
she has moved away
where has she gone to dwell
she did not say
what a melancholy thing not to know the address of one's soul
love has its childishness other passions have their pettiness ee
shame on the passions which he little man
honor to the one which makes a child of him
there is one strange thing do you know it
i dwell in the night
there is a being who carried off my sky when she went away
oh
would that we were lying side by side in the same grade hand in hand and from time to time in the darkness gently caressing a finger that would suffice for my eternity
he who suffer because ye love love get more
to die of love is to live in it
love
a sombre and starry transfiguration is mingled with this torture
there is ecstasy in agony
oh joy of the birds
it is because they have nests that they sing
love is a celestial respiration of the air of paradise
deep hearts save minds take life as god has made it it is a long trial an in comprehensible preparation for an unknown destiny
this destiny the true one begins for a man with the first step inside the tomb
then something appears to him and he begins to distinguish the definitive
the definitive meditate upon that word
the living perceive the infinite the definitive permits itself to be seen only by the dead
in the meanwhile love and suffer hope and contemplate
so salad
to him who shall have loved only bodies forms appearances
death will deprive him of all
try to life would you will find them again
i encountered in the streets very poor young man who was in love
hi what was old his coat was worn his elbows were in holds water trickled through his shoes and the stars through his soul
what a grand thing it is to beloved
what a far grander thing it is to love
the heart becomes heroic by dint of passion
it is no longer composed of anything but what is pure it no longer rests on anything that is not elevated and great
an unworthy thought can no more germinate in it than a nettle on a glacier
the serene and lofty soul inaccessible to vulgar passions and emotions dominating the clouds and the shades of this world it's follies it's lies it's hatred site vanities its miseries inhabits the blue of heaven and no longer feels anything but profound and subterranean shocks of destiny as the crests of mountains feel the shocks of earthquake
if there did not exist someone who loved the sun would become extinct
chapter v cosette after the letter as coast here adams gradually fell into thought
at the very moment when she raised her eyes from the last line of the notebook the handsome officer passed triumphantly in front of the rate it was his hour cosette thought him hideous
she resumed her contemplation of the book
it was written in the most charming of ch orography thought cosette in the same hand but with vivera inks sometimes very black again whitish as when i uk has been added to the ink stand and consequently on different days
it was then a mind which has unfolded itself the design by sigh irregularly without order without choice without object haphazard
cover he had never read anything like it
this manuscript in which she already perceived more light than obscurity produced upon her the effect of a half open sanctuary
each one of these mysterious lines shine before her eyes and inundated her heart with a strange radiance
the education which she had received had always talked to her of the soul and never of love very much as one might talk of the fire brand and not of the flame
this manuscript of fifteen pages suddenly and sweetly revealed to her all of love sorrow destiny life eternity the beginning the end
it was as if a hand had opened and suddenly flung upon her a handful of days of light
in these few lines she felt a passionate ardent generous honest nature a sacred will an immense sorrow and an immense despair a suffering heart an ecstasy fully expanded
what was this manuscript
a letter
a letter without name without address without date without signature pressing and disinterested an enigma composed of truths a message of love made to be brought by an angel and read by a virgin an appointment made beyond the bounds of earth the love letter of a phantom to a shade
it was an absent one tranquil and detected who seemed ready to take refuge in death and who sent to the absent love his past the secret of fate theory of life love
this has been written with one foot in the grave and one finger in heaven
these lines which had fallen off by one on the paper were what might be called drops of soul
now from whom could these pages come
who could have penned them
cosette did not hesitate a moment
one man only
he
day has dawned once more in her spirit all had reappeared
she felt an unheard of joy and a profound anguish
it was he
he who had written
he was there
it was he whose arm had been thrust through that railing
while she was forgetful of him he had found her again
but had she forgotten him
no never
she was foolish to have thought so for a single moment
she had always loved him always adored him
the fire had been smothered and had shouldered for a time but she saw all plainly now it had but made headway and now it had burst forth a fresh and had inflamed her whole being
this notebook was like a spark which had fallen from that other soul into hers
she felt the conflagration starting up once more
she imbued herself thoroughly with every word of the manuscript oh yes
said she how perfectly i recognize all that
that is what i had already read in his eyes
as she was finishing it for the third time lieutenant the ovule passed the gate once more and rattled his spurs upon the pavement
cosette was forced to raise her eyes
she thought him insipid silly stupid useless foppish displeasing impertinent and extremely ugly
the officer thought it his duty to smile at her
she turned away as in shame and indignation
she would gladly have thrown something at his head
she fled reentered the house and shut herself up in her chamber to peruse the manuscript once more to learn it by heart and to dream
when she had thoroughly mastered it she kissed it and put it in her bosom
all was over cosette had fallen back into deep seraphic love
the abyss of even had yawned once more
all day long cosette remained in a sort of bewilderment
she scarcely thought her ideas were in the state of a tangled skein of her brain she could not manage to conjecture anything she hoped through a tremor what
vague things
she dared make herself no promises and she did not wish to refuse herself anything
flashes of pallor passed over her countenance and shivers ran through her frame
it seemed to her at intervals that she was entering the land of chimaera as he said to herself is this reality
then she felt of the dead paper within her bosom under her gown she pressed it to her heart she felt it's angles against her flesh and if jean valjean had seen her at the moment he would have shuddered in the presence of that luminous and unknown joy which overflowed from beneath her eyelids
oh yes
she thought it is certainly be
this comes from him and is for me
and she told herself that an intervention of the angels a celestial chance had given him back to get
oh transfiguration of love
my dreams
that celestial chance that intervention of the angels was a pellet of bread tossed by one thief to another thief from the charlemagne courtyard to the lion's ditch over the roots of la force
chapter vi old people are made to go out opportune it when evening came jean valjean went out cosette dressed herself
she arranged her hair in the most becoming manner and she put on a dress whose bodice had received one ship of the scissors too much and which through this slope permitted a view of the beginning of her throat and was as young girls say a trifle indecent
it was not in the least in decent but it was prettier than usual
she made her toilet thus without knowing why she did so
did she mean to go out
no
was she expecting a visitor
no
at dusk she went down to the garden
toussaint was busy in her kitchen which opened on the backyard
she began to stroll about under the trees thrusting aside the branches from time to time with her hand because there were some which hung very low
in this manner she reached the bench
the stone was still there
she sat down and gently paid her white hand on this stone as though she wished to caress and thank it
all at once she experienced that indefinable impression which one undergoes when there is someone standing behind one even when she does not see the person
she turned her head and rose to her feet
it was he
his head was bare
he appeared to have grown thin and pale
his black clothes were hardly discernible
the twilight threw as an light on his find brow and covered his eyes in shadows
beneath a veil of incomparable sweetness he had something about him that suggested death and night
his face was illuminated by the light of the dying day and by the thought of a soul that is taking flight
he seemed to be not yet a ghost and he was no longer a man
he had flung away his hat in the thicker a few paces distant
cosette though ready to swoon uttered no cry
where treated slowly for she felt herself attracted
he did not stir
by virtue of something ineffable and melancholy which enveloped him she felt the look in his eyes which she could not see
cosette in her retreat encountered a tree and leaned against it
had it not been for this tree she would have fallen
then she heard his voice that voice which she had really never heard barely rising above the rustle of the leaves and murmuring pardon me here i am
my heart of full
i could not live on as i was living and i have come
have you read what i placed there on the bench
do you recognize me at all
have no fear of me
it is a long time you remember the day since you looked at me at the luxembourg near the gladiator
and the day when you passed before me
it was ont meth of june and the dog july
it is nearly a year ago
i have not seen you for a long time
i inquired of the woman who let the chairs and she told me that she no longer saw you
you lived in the rue del' ouest on the third floor in the front apartments of a new house you see that i know
i followed you
what else was there for me to do
and then you disappeared
i thought i saw you pass once while i was reading the newspapers under the arcade of the odeon
iran after you
but no
it was a person who had a bonnet like yours
at night i came hither
do not be afraid no one sees me
i come to gaze upon your windows me wrath and
i walk very softly so that you may not hear for you might be alarmed
the other evening i was behind you you turned round idler
once i heard you singing
i was happy
did it affect you because i heard you singing through the shutters
that could not hurt you
no it is not so
you see you are my angel
let me come sometimes i think that i am going to die
if you only knew
i adore you
forgive me i speak to you but i do not know what i am saying i may have displeased you have i displeased you
oh
my mother
said she
and she sank down as though on the point of death
he grasped her she fell he took her in his arms he pressed her close without knowing what he was doing
he supported her though he was tottering himself
it was as though his brain were full of smoke lightning's darted between his lips his ideas vanished it seemed to him that he was accomplishing some religious act and that he was committing a profanation
moreover he had not the least passion for this lovely woman who cs force he felt against his breast
he was beside himself with love
she took his hand and laid it on her heart
he felt the paper there he stammered you love me then
she replied in a voice solos that it was no longer anything more than a barely audible breath bush
thou knowest it
and she hid her blushing face on the breast of the superb and intoxicated young man
he fell upon the bench and she beside him
they had no words more
the stars were beginning to glean
how did it come to pass that their lips met
how comes into pass that the birds sing that snow melts that the rose unfolds that may expands that the dawn grows white behind the black trees on the shivering crest of the hills
a kiss and that was all
both started and gazed into the darkness with sparkling eyes
they felt neither the cool night nor the cold stone nor the camp earth northeast brass they looked at eachother and their hearts were full of thoughts
they had clasped hands unconsciously
she did not ask him she did not even wonder how he had entered there and how he had made his way into the garden
it seemed so simple to her that he should be there
from time to time marius' knee touched cosette's knee and both shivered
at intervals cosette stammered a word
her soul fluttered in her lips like a drop of sedona flower
little by little they began to talk to each other
effusion followed silence which is fulness
the night was serene and splendid overhead
these two being a pure as spirits told each other everything their dreams their intoxication's their ecstasies their chimaera's their weaknesses how they had adored each other from afar how they had longed for each other their despair when they had ceased to see each other
they confided to eachother in an ideal intimacy which nothing could augment their most secret and most mysterious thoughts
they related to each other with candid faith in their illusions all that love youth and the remains of childhood which still lingered about then suggested to their minds
their two hearts poured themselves out into each other in such wise that at the expiration of a quarter of an hour it was the young man who had the young girl's soul and the young girl who had the young man's soul
each became permeated with the other they were enchanted with each other they dazzled each other
when they had finished when they had told each other everything she laid her head on his shoulder and asked him what is your name
my name is marius said he
and yours
my name is cosette
book sixth
little bag roche chapter i. the malicious playfulness of the wind since when the tavern of mont vermeil was on the way to shipwreck and was being gradually engulfed not in the abyss of a bankruptcy but in the cesspool of petty debts the the barrier pair had had two other children both males
that made five two girls and three boys
madame the barrier had got rid of the last two while they were still going and very small with remarkable luck
got rid of is the word
there was but a mere fragment of nature in that woman
a phenomenon by the way of which there is more than one example extant
like the marechal e del amo them pusan court the the barrier was a mother to her daughters only
there yet maternity ended
her hatred of the human race began with her own sons
in the direction of her sons her evil disposition was uncompromising and her heart had a lugubrious wall in that quarter
as the reader has seen she detested the eldest she cursed the other two
why
because
the most terrible of motives the most unanswerable of retorts because
i have no need of a litter of a qual long brats said this mother
let us explain how the the barriers had succeeded in getting rid of their last two children and even in drawing profit from the operation
the woman magnon who was mentioned a few pages further back was the same one who had succeeded in making old guild norm and support the two children which she had had
she lived on the quai des celestine at the corner of this ancient street of the petit misc which afforded her the opportunity of changing here file route into good odor
the reader will remember the great epidemic of croup which ravaged the river districts of the seine in paris ftir by five years ago and of which science took advantage to make experiments on a grand scale as to the efficacy of inhalations of alum so beneficially replaced at the present day by the external tincture of iodine
during this epidemic the magnon lost both her boys who were still very young one in the morning the other in the evening of the same day
this was a blow
these children were precious to their mother they represented eighty francs a month
these eighty brands were punctually paid in the name of m
ville normand by collector of his tent am
barns are tired too staff in the rue du roi de sickle
the children read the income was at an end
the magnon sought an expedient
in that dark freemasonry of evil of which she formed a part everything is known all secrets are kept and will end mutual aid
magnon needed two children the the barriers had two
the same sex the same age
a good arrangement for the one a good investment for the other
the little the barriers became little man none
magnon quitted the quai des celestine and went to live in the rue cloche perce
in paris the identity which binds an individual to himself is broken between one street and another
the registry office being in no way warned raised no objections and the cub stitution was effected on the most simple manner in the world
only the the barrier exacted for this loan of her children ten francs a month which may non promised to pay and which she actually did pay
it is unnecessary to add that m
ville norm and continued to perform his compact
he came to see the children every six months
he did not perceive the change
monsieur magnon said to him how much they resemble you
the barrier to whom avatars were easy seized this occasion to become jon dee the
his two daughters and gave if he had hardly had time to discover that they had two little brothers
when a certain degree of misery is reached one is overpowered with a sort of spectral indifference and one regards human beings as though they were spectres
your nearest relations are often no more for your hands the shadowy forms barely outlined against a nebulous background of life and easily confounded again with the invisible
on the evening of the day when she had handed over her two little ones to magnon with express intention of renouncing them forever the the barrier had belt or had appeared to feel a scruple
she said to her husband but this is abandoning our children
the married masterful and phlegmatic day terized the scruple with this saying jean jacques rousseau did even better
from scruples the mother proceeded to uneasiness but what if the police were to annoy us
tell me monsieur the barrier is what we have done permissible
the barrier replied everything is permissible
no one will see anything but true blue unit
besides no one has any interest in looking closely after children who have not as ok
gagnon was a sort of fashionable woman in the sphere of crime
she was careful about her toilet
she shared her lodgings which were furnished in an affected and wretched style with a clever gallico add english thief
this english woman who had become a naturalized parisienne recommended by very wealthy relations intimately connected with the medals in the library and mademoiselle mar's diamonds became celebrated later on in judicial accounts
she was called mansell e miss
the two little creatures who had fallen to magnon had no reason to complain of their lot
recommended by the eighth francs they were well cared for as is everything from which profit is derived they were neither badly clothed not badly fed they were treated almost like little gentlemen better by their false mother than by their realone
magnon played the lady and talked no thieves' slang in their presence
thus passed several years
the barrier sutured well from the fact
one way he chanced to say to magnon as she handed him his monthly stipend often francs the father must give them some education
all at once these two poor children who had up to that time been protected tolerably well even by their evil fate were abruptly hurled into life and forced to begin it for themselves
a wholesale arrest of male factors like that in the jon dee the garret necessarily complicated by investigations and subsequent incarceration's is a veritable disaster for that hideous and occult counter society which pursues its existence beneath public society an adventure of this description entails all sorts of catastrophes in that sombre world
the the barrier catastrophe involved the catastrophe of magnon
one day a short time after may not had handed to do onine the note relating to the tue plumer a sudden raid was made by the police in the tue cloche pence magnon was seized as was also make elle miss and all the inhabitants of the house which was of a suspicious character were gathered into the net
while this was going on the two little boys were playing in the backyard and saw nothing of the raid
when they tried to enter the house again they found the door fastened and the house empty
a cobbler opposite called them to him and delivered to them a paper which their mother had left for them
on this paper there was an address m
badge collector of rents rue du roi de sickle no
the proprietor of the stall said to them you can not live here any longer
go there
it is nearby
the first street on the left
ask your way from this paper
the children set out the elder leading the younger and holding in his hand the paper which was to guide them
it was cold and his bs number little fingers could not close very firmly and they did not keep a very good hold on the paper
at the corner of the rue cloche perce a gust of wind tore it from him and as night was calling the child was not able to find it again
they began to wander aimlessly through the streets
chapter ii on which little bag roche extracts profit from napoleon the great spring in paris is often traversed by harsh and piercing breezes which do not precisely chill bit free seige these north winds which sadden the most beautiful days produce exactly the effect of those puffs of cold air which enter a warm room through the cracks of a badly fitting door or window
it seems as though the gloomy door of winter had remained a jar and as though the wind were pouring through it
in the spring of the epoch when the first great epidemic of this century broke out in europe these north tales were more harsh and piercing than ever
it was a door even more glacial than that of winter which was a jar
it was the door of the sepulchre
in these winds one felt the breath of the cholera
from a meteorological point of view these cold winds possessed this peculiarity that they did not preclude a string electric tension
frequent storms accompanied by thunder and lightning burst forth at this epoch
one evening when these tales were flowing rudely to such a degreethat january seemed to have returned and that the bourgeois had resumed their cloaks little bag roche who was always shivering gayly under his rage was standing as though in ecstasy before a wig baker's shop in the vicinity of their me saint gervais
he was adorned with a woman's woollen shawl picked up no one knows where and which he had converted into a neck comforter
little gave if he appeared to be engaged in intent admiration of aaaa bride in a low necked dress and crowned with orange flowers who was revolving in the window and displaying her smile to passersby between two art and lamps but in reality he was taking an observation of the ship in order to discover whether he could not prog from the shop fronts sake of soap which he would then proceed to sell for as ok to a hairdresser in the suburbs
he had often managed to breakfast off of such a roll
he called his species of work for which he possessed special aptitudes having barbers
while contemplating the bride and eyeing the sake of soap he muttered between his teeth tuesday
it was not tuesday
was it tuesday
perhaps it was tuesday
yes it was tuesday
no one has ever discovered to what this monologue referred
yes perchance this monologue has some connection with the last occasion on which he had dined three days before for it was now friday
the barber in his shop which was warmed by a good stoves ass having a customer and casting a glance from time to time at the enemy that freezing and impudent street urchin both of whose hands were in his pockets buy whose mind was evidently unsheathed
while gave if he was scrutinizing the shop window and the cakes of windsor soap two children of unequal stature very neatly dressed and still smaller than himself one apparently about seven years of age the other five timidly turned the handle and entered the shop with a request for something or other aims possibly in a plaintive murmur which resembled a groan rather than a prayer
they both spoke at once and their words were unintelligible because so he broke the voice of the younger and the teeth of the elder were statue ring with cold
the barber wheeled round with a furious look and without abandoning his razor thrust back the elder with his left hand and the younger with his knee and slammed his door saying the idea of coming in and freezing everybody for nothing
the two children resumed their march in tears
in the meantime a cloud had risen it had begun to rain
little gave if he ran after them and accosted them what's the matter with young age
wedon't know where we are to sleep replied the elder
is that all
said nav roche
's great matter truly
the idea of bawling about that
they must be greenies
and adopting in addition to his superiority which was rather b entering an accent of tender authority and gentle patronage come along with me young' uns
yes sir said the elder
and the two children followed him as they would have followed an archbishop
they had stopped crying
gav roche led them up the rue saint antoine in the direction of the bastille
we have if he walked along he cast an indignant backward glance at the barber's shop
that fellow has no heart the whiting he muttered
he's an englishman
a woman who caught sight of these three marching in a file with gave oche at their head burst into noisy laughter
this laugh was wanting in respect towards the group
good day mansell e omnibus sandra crochet our r
an instant later the wig maker occurred to his mind once more and he added i am making a mistake in the beast he's not a whiting he's a serpent
barber i'll go and fetch a locksmith and i'll have a bell hung to your tail
this wig maker had rendered him aggressive
as he strode over a gutter new post room used a bearded port read who was worthy to meet faust on the brocken and who has a broom in her hand
madam said he do you are going out with your horse
and thereupon he spattered the polished boots of a pedestrian
you scamp
shouted the furious pedestrian
gav roche elevated his nose above his shawl
is monsieur complaining
if you
ejaculated the man
the office is closed said had roche i do not receive any more complaints
in the meanwhile as he went on up the street he perceived a beggar girl thirteen or fourteen years old and clad in so short a gown that her knees were visible lying thoroughly chilled under all the coc here
the little girl was getting to be too old for such a thing
growth does play these tricks
the petticoat become a short at the moment when nudity he comes in recent
poor girl
said had roche
she hasn'y even trousers
hold on take this
and unwinding all the comfortable woollen which he had around his neck he flung it on the thin and purple shoulders of the beggar girl where the scarf became a shawl once more
the child stared at him in astonishment and received the shawl in silence
when a certain stage of distress has been reached in his misery the poor man no longer groans over evil no longer returns thanks for good
that some beer
said had roche who was shivering more than saint martin for the latter retained one half of his cloak
at this bred
the downpour of rain redoubled in its spite became curious
the wicked skies punish good deeds
at come now
exclaimed gev roche what's the meaning of this
it's retaining
good heavens if it goes on like this is hall stop my subscription
and he set out on the march once more
it's allright he resumed casting a glance at the beggar girl as she coiled up under the shawl she's got a famous peel
and looking up at the clouds he exclaimed caught
the two children followed close on his heels
as they were passing one of these heavy grated lattices which indicates baker's shop for bread is put behind bars like gold gave if he turned round am by the way brats have defined
monsieur replied the elder we have had nothing to eat since this morning
so you have neither father nor mother
resume drag roche majestically
excuse us cir we have a papa and a mamma but wedon't know where they are
sometimes that's better than knowing where they are said had roche who was a thinker
we have been a agreeing about these two hours continued the elder we have hunted for things at the corners of the streets but we have found nothing
i know ejaculated gev roche it's the dogs who eat everything
he went on after a pause am
we have lost our authors
wedon't know what we have done with them
this should not be famine
it's stupid to let old people stray off like that
come now
we must have a snooze all the same
however he asked them no questions
what was more simple than that they should have no dwelling place
the elder of the two children who had almost entirely recovered the prompt needless ness of childhood uttered this exclamation it's queer all the same
mamma told us that she would take us to get a blessed spray on palm sunday
bosh said had roche
mamma resumed the elder is a lady who lives with manse ole miss
tan flute
retorted had roche
meanwhile he had halted and for the last two minutes he had been feeling and fumbling in all sorts of books which his tags contained
atlas the tossed his head with an air intended to be merely satisfied but which was triumphant in reality
let us be calm found' uns
here's supper for three
and from one of his pocket she drew forth as ok
without allowing the two urchins time for amazement he pushed both of them before him into the baker's shop and flung his sou on the counter crying boy
five centimes' worth of bread
the baker who was the proprietor in person took up a loaf and a knife
in three piece any boy
senting abroche
and he added with dignity there are three of us
and seeing that the baker after scrutinizing the three customers had taken down a black load he thrust his finger far up his nose with an inhalation as imperious as though he had had a pinch of the great frederick's snuff on the top of his thumb and hurled this indignant apostrophe fill in the baker's face of use of a
those of our readers who might be tempted does it in this interpro lation of bad roche's to the baker a russian or a polish word or one of those savage cries which they o ways and the bit of ufos girl at each other from bank to bank of a river athwart the solitudes are warned that it is a word which they our readers utter every day and which takes the place of the phrasequ'est ce quec'est que cela
the baker understood perfectly and replied well
it's bread and very good bread of the second quality
you mean parton brutal black bread
retorted had roche calmly and coldly disdainful
white bread boy
white bread parton's a donne
i'm standing treat
the baker could not repress a smile and as he cut the white bread he surveyed them in a compassionate way which shocked had roche
come now baker's boy
said he what are you taking our measure like that for
all three of them placed end to end would have hardly made a measure
when the bread was cut the baker threw the sky into his drawer and had roche said to the two children grub away
the little boys stared at him in surprise
gav roche began to laugh
ah
hullo that's sl
theydon't understand yet they're too small
and he repeated eat away
at the same time he held out a piece of bread to each of them
and thinking that the elder who seemed to him the more worthy of his conversation reserved some special encouragement and ought to be relieved from all hesitation to satisfy his appetite he added as he handed him the largest share day that into your muzzle
one piece was smaller than the other she kept this for himself
the poor children including had roche were banished
as they tore their breed apart in big mouthfuls they blocked up the shop of the baker who now that they had paid their money looked angrily at them
let's go into the street again said had roche
they set off once more in the direction of the bastille
from time to time as they passed the lighted shop windows the smallest halted to look at the time on a leaden watch which was suspended from his neck by a cord
well he is a very green' unsaid had roche
then becoming thoughtful he muttered between his teeth all the same if i had charge of the bandso'clock' em up better than that
just as they were finishing their morsel of bread and had reached the angle of that gloomy rue des ballets at the other end of which the low and threatening wicket of la force was visible hullo is that you had roche
said someone
hullo is that you montparnasse
said had roche
a man had just accosted the street urchin and the man was no other than montparnasse in disguise with blue spectacles but recognizable to fav roche
the bow wow's
senting abroche you've got a hide the color of a linseed plaster and blue specs like a doctor
you're putting on style' pon my word
bush
ejaculated montparnasse not so loud
and he drew had roche hastily out of range of the lighted crops
the two little ones followed mechanically holding each other by the hand
when they were ensconced under the arch of sports so there sheltered from the rain and from all eyes do you know where i'm going
demanded montparnasse
to the abbey of a scene with regret replied had roche
joker
and montparnasse went on i'm going to find babe t
ay
exclaimed had to check her name is babe t
montparnasse lowered his voice note hehe
ah
baber
yes babe t
i thought he was buckles
he had undone the buckle replied montparnasse
and he rapidly related to the gaming is on the morning of that very day babe t having been transferred to la concierge die had made his escape by turning to the left instead of to the right in the police office
bad roche expressed his admiration for this skill
what a dentist
he tried
montparnasse added a few details set of a bet's flight and ended with oh
that's not all
had to chew she listened had seized a cane that montparnasse held in his hand and mechanically pulled at the upper left and the blade of a dagger made its appearance
ah
he exclaimed pushing the dagger back in haste you have brought along your gendarme disguised as a bourgeois
montparnasse winked
the deuce
resumed gave o curso you're going to have about with the hobbies
youcan't tell replied montparnasse with an indifferent air
it's always a good thing to have a pin about one
yafro she persisted what are you up to tonight
again montparnasse took a grave tone and said mouthing every syllable things
and abruptly changing the conversation by the way
what
something happenedt'other day
fancy
i meet a bourgeois
he makes me a present of a sermon and his purse
i put it in my pocket
a minute later i feel in my pocket
there's nothing there
except the sermon said had roche
but you went on montparnasse where are you found for now
have or he pointed to his two proteges and said i'm going to put these infants to bed
whereabouts is the bed
at my house
where's your house
at my house
so you have a lodging
yes i have
and where is your lodging
in the elephant said had roche
montparnasse though not naturally inclined to astonishment could not restrain an exclamation
in the elephant
well yes in the elephant
retorted gavel and
k fmcsa
this is another word of the language which no one writes and which everyone speaks
leica a signifies quest quec'est que cela a
what's the matter with that
the urchin's profound remark recalled montparnasse to calmness and good sense
he appeared to return to better sentiments with regard to fav roche's lodging
of course said he yes the elephant
is it comfortable there
very said had roche
it's really fully there
thereain'ta by draughts as there are under the bridges
how do you get in
oh i get in
so there is a hole
demanded montparnasse
par bleu
i should say so
but you mustn't tell
it's between the forelegs
the hobbies haven't seen it
and you climb up
yes i understand
a turn of the hands ri sc rac and it's all over no one there
after a pause gave if he added i shall have a ladder for these children
montparnasse burst out laughing where the devil did you pick up those young' uns
yafro she replied with great simplicity they are some beats that a wig maker made me a present of
meanwhile montparnasse has fallen to thinking you recognized me very readily he muttered
he took from his pocket two small objects which were nothing more than two quills wrapped in cotton and thrust one up each of his nostrils
this gave him a different nose
that changes you remarked had roche you are less homely so you ought to keep them on all the time
montparnasse was a handsome fellow but gave if he was a tease
seriously demanded montparnasse how do you like me so
the sound of his voice was different also
in a twinkling montparnasse had become unrecognizable
oh
do play por rich in elle for us
exclaimed had roche
the two children who had not been listening up to this point being occupied themselves in thrusting their fingers up their noses drew near at this name and stared at montparnasse with dawning joy and admiration
unfortunately montparnasse was troubled
be laid his hand on nav roche's shoulder and said to him emphasizing his words listen to what i tell you boy
if i were on the square with my son my knife and my wife and if you were to squander ten alison me iwouldn't refuse to work but thisisn't shrove tuesday
this odd phrase produced a singular effect on the gamin
he wheeled round hastily wasted his little sparkling eyes about him with profound attention and perceive fa police sergeant standing with his back to them a few paces off
gav roche allowed anau
hood
to escape him but immediately suppressed it and shaking montparnasse's hand well good evening said he i'm going off to my elephant with my beats
supposing that you should need me some night you can come and high me up there
i lodge on the entre sol
there is no porter
you will inquire for monsieur had roche
very good said montparnasse
and they parted montparnasse be taking himself in the direction of the greve and had roche towards the bastille
the little one of five dragged along by his brother who was dragged by gave if he turned his head back several times to watch port of hotel lead he went
the ambiguous phrase by means of which montparnasse had warned tag roche of the presence of the policeman contained no other talisman than the assonance fig repeated five or six times in different forms
this syllable right here's alone or artistically mingled with the words of a phrase means take care we can no longer talk freely
there was besides in montparnasse's sentence a literary beauty which was lost upon had roche that is not do them as a guest mad i guess lang expression of the temple which signifies my dog my knife and my wife greatly in vogue among clowns and the red tails in the great century when moliere wrote and call or deed
twenty years ago there was still to be seen in the southwest corner of the place de la bastille near the basin of the canal excavated in the ambient ditch of the fortress prison a singular monument which has already been effaced from the memories of parisians and which deserves to leave some trace for it was the idea of a member of the institute the general in chief of the army of egypt
we say monument although it was only a rough model
but this model itself a marvellous sketch the grandiose skeleton of an idea of napoleon's which successive gusts of wind have carried away and thrown on each occasion still further from us had become historical and had acquired a certain definiteness which contrasted with its provisional aspect
it was an elephant forty feet high constructed of timber and masonry bearing on its back at over which resembled a house formerly painted green by some dauber and now painted black by heaven the wind and time
in this deserted and unprotected corner of the place the broad brow of the colossus hist run it is the us his tower his enormous c. ruppert is four feet like columns produced at night under the starry heavens a surprising and terrible form
it was a sort of symbol of popular force
it was sombre mysterious and immense
it was some mighty visible phantom one knew not what standing erect beside the invisible spectre of the bastille
few strangers visited this edifice no passed by looked at it
it was falling into ruins every season the plaster which detached itself from its sides formed hideous wounds upon it
these files as the expression rabin elegant dialect had forgotten it ever since
there it stood in it's corner melancholy sick crumbling surrounded by a rotten palisades oiled continually by drunken coachmen cracks meandered at heart its belly a path projected from its tail tall grass flourished between its legs and as the level of the place had been rising all around it for a space of thirty years by that slow and continuous movement which insensibly elevates the soil of large towns it stood in a hollow and it looked as though the ground were giving way beneath it
it was unclean despised repulsive and superb ugly in the eyes of the bourgeois melancholy in the eyes of the thinker
there was something about it of the dirt which is on the point of being swept out and something of the majesty which is on the point of being decapitated
as we have said at night its aspect changed
night is the real element of everything that is dark
as soon as twilight descended the old elephant became transfigured he assumed a tranquil and redoubtable appearance in the formidable serenity of the shadows
being of the past he belonged tonight and obscurity was in keeping with his grandeur
this rough squat heavy hard austere almost misshapen but assuredly majestic monument stamped with a sort of magnificent and savage gravity has disappeared and left to reign in peace a sort of gigantic store ornamented with its pipe which has replaced the sombre fortress with its nine to see a very much as the bourgeoisie replaces the feudal classes
it is quite natural that a stove should be the symbol of an epoch in which a lot contains power
this epoch will pass away people have already begun to understand that if there can be force in a boiler there can be no force except in the brain in other words that which leads and drags on the world is not locomotives but ideas
harness locomotives to ideas that is well done but do not mistake the horse for the rider
at all events to return to the place de la bastille the architect of this elephant succeeded in making a grand thing out of plaster the architect of the stove has succeeded in making a pretty thing out of bronze
this stove pipe which has been baptized by a sonorous name and called the column of july this monument of a revolution that miscarried was still enveloped in in an immense short of wood work which we regret for our part and by a vast plank enclosure which completed the task of isolating the elephant
it was towards this corner of the place dimly lighted by the reflection of a distant street lamp that the gamin guided his two beats
the reader must permit us to interrupt ourselves here and to remind him that we are dealing with simple reality and that twenty years ago the tribunals were called upon to judge under the charge of vagabond age and mutilation of a public monument a child who had been caught asleep in this very elephant of the bastille
this fact noted we proceed
on arriving in the vicinity of the colossus gatto che comprehended the effect which the infinitely great might produce on the infinitely small and saiddon't be scared infants
then he entered through a gap in the fence into the elephant's enclosure and helped the young ones to clamber through the breach
the two children somewhat frightened followed had roche without uttering a word and confided themselves to this little providence in rats which had given them bread and had promised them a shelter
there extended along the fence lay a ladder which by day served the laborers in the neighboring timber yard
gav roche raised it with remarkable vigor and placed it against one of the elephant's forelegs
near the point where the ladder ended a sort of black hole in the belly of the colossus could be distinguished
gav roche pointed out the ladder and the hole to his guests and said to them climb up and to in
the two little boys exchanged terrified glances
you're afraid brats
exclaimed had roche
and he added you shall see
he clasped the rough leg of the elephant and in a twinkling without weighing to make use of the ladder he had reached the aperture
he entered it as an added slips through a crevice and disappeared within and an instant later the two children saw his head which looked pale appear vaguely on the edge of the shadowy hole like a wan and whitish spectre
well
he exclaimed climb up young' uns
you'll see how shut it is here
come up you
he said to the elder i'll lend you shane
the little fellows judged each other the gamin frightened and inspired them with confidence at one and the same time and then it was raining very hard
the elder one undertook the risk
the younger on seeing his brother climbing up and himself left alone between the laws of this huge beast felt greatly inclined to cry but he did not care
the elder law climbed within certain steps up the rungs of the ladder have ochs in the meanwhile encouraging him with exclamations like a fencing master to his pupils it amulet set to his miles
don't be afraid
that's it
come on
put your feet there
give us your hand here
boldly
and when the child was within reach he seized him suddenly and vigorously by the arm and pulled him towards him
nabbed
said he
the gray had passed through the crack
now said had roche wait for me
be so good as to take a seat monsieur
and making his way out of the hole as he had entered it he slipped down the elephant's leg with the ability of a monkey lander on his feet in the grass grasped the child office round the body and planted him fairly in the middle of the ladder then he began to climb up behind him shouting to the elder i'm going to boost him do you tug
and in another instant the small lad was pushed dragged pulled thrust stuffed into the role before he had time to recover himself and had roche entering be kind him and re pulsing the ladder with a kick which sent it flat on the grass began to clap his hands and to cry here we are
long life general lafayette
this explosion overhead dec now young' uns you are in my house
gav roche was at home in fact
oh unforeseen utility of the useless
charity of great things
goodness of giants
this huge monument which had embodied an idea of the emperor's had become the box of a street urchin
the gray had been accepted and sheltered by the colossus
the bourgeois decked out in their sunday finery who passed the elephant of the bastille were fond of saying as they scanned it disdainfully with their prominent eyes what's the good of that
it served to save from the fold the frost the hall and rain to shelter from the winds of winter to preserve from slumber in the mud which produces fever and from slumber in the snow which produces death a little being who had no father to mother no bread no clothes no refuge
it served to receive the innocent whom society repulsed
it served to diminish public crime
it was a pair open to one against whom all doors were shut
it seemed as though the miserable old mastodon invaded by vermin and oblivion covered with warts with mould and ulcers to the ringworm eaten abandoned condemned a sort of mendicant colossus asking aims in vain with a benevolent look in the midst of the crossroads had taken pity on that other mendicant the poor pygmy who roamed without shoes to his feet without a roof over his head blowing on his fingers clad in rats fed on rejected scraps
that was what the elephant of the bastille was good for
this idea of napoleon disdained by men had been taken back by god
that which had n den merely illustrious had become august
in order to realize his thought the emperor should have had porphyry brass iron gold marble the old collection of planks beams and plaster suffices for god
the emperor had had the dream of a genius in that titanic elephant armed prodigious with trunk uplifted bearing it shower and scattering on all sides it's merry and vivid ying water she wished to incarnate the people
god had done a grander thing with it he had lodged a child there
the hole through which davros he had entered was a breach which was hardly visible from the outside being concealed as we have stated beneath the elephant's belly and so narrow that it was only cats and homeless children who could pass through it
let's behind airnav roche by telling the porter that we are not at home
and plunging into the darkness with the assurance of a person who is well acquainted with his apartment she took a plank and stopped up the aperture
again gave if he plunged into the obscurity
the children heard the crackling of the match thrust into the phosphoric bottle
the chemical match was not yet in existence at that epoch the eu made steel represented progress
a sudden light made them blink have often adjust managed to ignite one of those bits of cord dipped in resin which are called seller rate
the cell art at which emitted more smoke than light rendered the interior of the elephant confusedly visible
gav roche's two guests glanced about them and the sensation which they experienced was something like that which one would feel it shut up in the great fun of heidelberg or better still like what jonah must have felt in the biblical belly of the whale
an entire and gigantic skeleton appeared enveloping the m
above a long brown beam whence started at regular distances massive arching to be represented the vertebral column with its sides stalactites of plaster depended from them like entrails and fast spiders' web's stretching from side to side formed dirty diaphragms
here and there in the corners were visible large blackish spots which has the appearance of being alive and which changed places rapidly with an abrupt and frightened movement
fragments which had fallen from the elephant's back into his belly bar filled up the cavity so that it was possible to walk upon it as on a floor
the smaller child nestled up against his brother and whispered to him it's black
this remark drew an exclamation from nav roche
the petrified que of the two bray's rendered some shock necessary
what's that you are babbling about there
he exclaimed
are you scoffing at me
are you turning up your nodes
do you want the tuileries
are you brutes
some say
i warn you that idon't belong to the regiment of simpletons
and one now are you beats from the pope's establishment
a little roughness is good in cases of fear
it is reassuring
the two children drew close to fav roche
gav roche paternally touched by this confidence passed from grace to gentle and addressing the smaller stupid said he accenting the insulting word with a caressing intonation it's outside that it is black
outside it's raining here it does not rain outside it's cold here there's not an atom of wine outside there are heaps of people here there's no one outside the realn't even the moon here there's my candle confound in
the two children began to look upon the apartment with less terror but gatto che allowed them no more time for contemplation
quick said he
and he pushed them towards what we are very glad to be able to call the end of the room
there stood his bed
gav roche's bed was complete that is to say it had a mattress a blanket and an alcove with curtains
the mattress was a straw hat the blanket a rather large strip of gray woollen stuff very warm and almost new
this is what the alcove consisted of three rather long poles thrust into and consolidated with the rubbish which formed the floor that is to say the belly of the elephant two in front and one behind and united by a rope at their summit weiss to form a pyramidal bundle
this cluster supported a trellis work of brass wire which was simply placed upon it but artistically applied and held by fastenings of iron wire so that it enveloped all three miles
a row of very heavy stones kept this network down to the floor so that nothing could pass under it
this grating was nothing else that a piece of the brass screens with which aviaries are covered in menagerie s
gav roche's bed stood as in a cage behind this net
the whole resembled an esquina latent
this trellis work took the place of curtains
get rid be moved aside the stones which fastened the net down in front and the two folds of the net which lapped over each other fell apart
down on all fours brats
said had roche
he made his guests enter the cage with great precaution then he crawled in after them pulled the stones together and closes the opening be the tically again
all three had stretched out on the mat
gatto che still had the cells frat in his hand
now said he go to sleep
i'm going to suppress the candelabra
monsieur the elder of the brothers asked had roche pointing to the netting what's that for
that answered have often gave it is for the rate
go to sleep
nevertheless he felt obliged to add a few words of instruction for the benefit of these young creatures and he continued it's a thing from the jardin des plantes
it's used for fierce animals
there'sa whole ship ful of them there
all you've got to do is to climb over a wall crawl through a window and pass through a door
you can get as much as you want
as he spoke he wrapped the younger one up bodily in a role of the blanket and the little one murmured oh
how good that is
it's warm
gav roche casta please were on the blanket
that's from the jardin des plantes too said he
i took that from the monkeys
and pointing out to the eldest them atom which he was lying a very thick and admirably made may be added that belonged to the giraffe
after a pause he went on the beasts had all these things
i took them away from them
itdosn't trouble them
i told them' it's for the elephant
' he paused and then resumed you crawl over the walls and youdon'ts are a straw for the government
so there now
the two children gazed with timid and stupefied respecting his intrepid and ingenious being a vagabond like themselves isolated like themselves trail like themselves who had something admirable and all powerful about him who seemed supernatural to them and whose physiognomy was composed of all the grimaces of an old mounts bank mingled with the most ingenious and charming smile s
monsieur ventured the elder timidly you are not afraid of the police then
gav roche contented himself with replying beat
nobody says' police' they say' hobbies
' the smaller had his eyes wide open but he said nothing
as he was on the edge of them at the elder being in the middle fabric be tucked the blanket round him as a mother might have done and heightened the mat under his head with old rats in such a way as to form a pillow for the child
then he turned to the elder hey
we're jolly comfortable hereain'ta e
ah yes
replied the elder gazing at gave of me with the expression of a saved angel
the two poor little children who had been soaked through began to grow warm once more
ah by the way continued had roche what were you basking about
and pointing out the little one to his brothers more like that i've nothing to say about but the idea of a big fellow like you crying
it's idiotic you looked like a calf
gracious replied the child we have no lodging
b other
retorted had roche youdon''t say' lodgings' you say' crib
' and then we were afraid of being alone like that at night
youdon''t say' night' you say' dark man's
' thank you sir said the child
listen went on nav roche you must never bawl again over anything
i'll take care of you
you shall see what fun we'll have
in summer we'll go to the glaciers with have tons of my pals we'll bathe in the gate we'll run stark naked in front of the rafts in the bridge at austerlitz that makes the la undresses rating
they scream they get mad and if you only knew how ridiculous they are
we'll go and see the man skeleton
and then i'll take you to the play
i'll take you to see frederick le maitre
i have tickets i know some of the actors i even played in a piece once
there were a lot of us tellers and we ran under a cloth and that made the sea
i'll get you an engagement at my theatre
we'll go to see the savages
thehain't real those savages ain' t
they wear pink rights that goal lim wrinkles and you can see where their elbows have been warned with white
then we'll go to the opera
we'll get in with the mired applauded s
the operas la que is well managed
iwouldn't associate with the cia que of the boulevard
at the opera just fancy
some of them pay twenty sous but they're not miss
they're called dish clout s
and then we'll go to see the guillotine work
i'll show you the executioner
he lives in the rue des marais
monsieur samson
he has a letter box at his door
ah
we'll have famous fun
at that moment a drop it was telling abroche's finger and recalled him to the realities of life
the dance
said he there's the wick giving out
attention
ican't spend more than a sou a month on my lighting
when a body goes to bed he must sleep
we haven't the time to read m
paul de kock's romances
and besides the light might pass through the cracks of the ported is here and all the bobbie's need to do is to see it
and then remarked the elder timidly he alone dared talk to fav roche and reply to him a spark might fall in the straw and we must look out and not burn the house down
peopledon't say' burn the house down' remarked g abroche they say' blaze the crib
' the storm increased in violence and the heavy downpour beat upon the back of the colossus a mud flaps of thunder
you're taken in rain
said nav roche
it amuses me to hear the decanter run down the legs of the house
winter is a stupid it waste site merchandise it loses its labor it can' teeth x and that makes it kick up a row old water carrier that it is
this allusion to the thunder all the consequences of which had roche in his character of a philosopher of the nineteenth century accepted was followed by a broad flash of lightning so dazzling that a hint of it entered the belly of the elephant through the crack
almost at the same instant the thunder fumbled with great city
the two little creatures uttered a shriek and started up so eagerly that the network came near being displaced but gave if he turned his bold face to them and took advantage of the flap of thunder to burst into a laugh
calm down children
don't topple over the edifice
that's fine first class thunder all eight
that's no slouch of a streak of lightning
bravo for the good god
deuce take it
it's almost as good as it is at the ambit y
that said he restored order in the getting pushed the two children gently down on the bed pressed their knees in order to stretch them out at full length and exclaimed since the good god is lighting his candle i can blow out mine
now babes now my young humans you must shut your peepers
it's very bad not to sleep
it'll make you swallow the strainer or as they say in fashionable society stinkin the bullet
wrap yourself up well in the hide
i'm going to put out the light
are you ready
yes murmured the elder i'm all right
i seem to have feathers under my head
peopledon't say' head' cried have oche they say' but'
the two children nestled close to each other nav god he finished arranging them on them at drew the blanket up to their very rare then repeated for the third time his injunction in the hier a tidal tongue shut your peepers
and he snuffed out his tiny light
hardly had the light been extinguished when a peculiar trembling began to affect the netting under which the three children lay
it consisted of a multitude of full scratches which produced a metallic sound as if claws and teeth were gnawing at the copper wire
this was accompanied by all sorts of little piercing cries
the little five year old boy on hearing this hubbub overhead and chilled with terror jogged his brother's elbow but the elder brother had already shut his per pers a stavros he had ordered
then the little one who could no longer control his terror questioned had roche but in a very low tone and with bated breath air
hey
said had roche who had just closed his eyes
what is that
it's the rate replied had roche
and he laid his head down on the mat again
the rats in fact who swarmed by thousands in the carcass of the elephant and who were the living black spots which we have already mentioned had been held in awe by the blame of the candle so long as it had been lighted but as soon as the cavern which was the same as their city had returned to darkness scenting what the good story teller perrault calls freshmeat they had hurled themselves in throng song abroche's tent had climbed to the top of it and had begun to bite them rates as though seeking to pierce this newfangled trap
still the little one could not sleep
sir
he began again
hey
said had roche
what are tags
they are mice
this explanation reassured the child a little
he had seen white mice in the course of his life and he was not afraid of them
nevertheless he lifted up his voice once more
sir
hey
said had roche again
whydon't you have a cat
i did have one replied had roche i brought one here but they ate her
this second explanation undid the work of the first and the little fellow began to tremble again
the dialogue between him and gave if he began again for the fourth time monsieur
hey
who was it that was eaten
the cat
and who are the cat
the rate
the mice
yes the rate
the child in consternation dismayed at the thought of mice which are cats pursued sir would those nice fat us
wouldn't they just
ejaculated had roche
the child's terror had reached its climax
but gave if he addeddon't be afraid
theycan't get in
and besides i'm here
here catch hold of my hand
hold your tongue and shut your keepers
at the same time gave if he grasped the little fellow's hand across his brother
the child pressed them and close to him and felt reassured
courage and strength have these mysterious ways of communicating themselves
silence reigned round them once more the sound of their voices had frightened off the rats at the expiration of a few minutes then came rating back but in vain the three little fellows were fast asleep and heard nothing more
the hours of the night flew away
darkness covered the vast place de la bastille
a wintry gale which mingled with the rainbow win gusts the patrol searched all the doorways alleys enclosures and obscure books and in their search for nocturnal vagabonds they passed in silence before the elephant the monster erect motionless staring open eyes on to the shadows had the appearance of dreaming happily over his good deed and sheltered from heaven and from men the three poor sleeping children
in order to understand what is about to follow the reader must remember that at that epoch the bastille guard house was situated at the other end of the square and that what took place in the vicinity of the elephant could neither be seen nor heard by the sentinel
towards the end of that hour which immediately prefers's the dawn's man turned from the rue saint antoine at a run made the circuit of the enclosure of the column of july and glided between the la kings until he was underneath the belly of the elephant
if any light had illuminated that man it might have been divined from the thorough manner in which he was soaked that he had passed the night in the rain
arrived beneath the elephant he uttered a peculiar cry which did not belong to any human tongue and which apar is yet alone could have imitated
twice he repeated this cry of whose orthography the following barely conveys an ideal if i kokuou
at the second cry a clear young merry voice responded from the belly of the elephant yes
almost immediately the plank which closed the hole was drawn aside and gave passage to a child who descended the elephant's leg and fell briskly near the man
it was had to the
the man was montparnasse
as for his cry of kiri kokuou that was doubtless what the child has meant when he said you will ask for monsieur had roche
on hearing if he had waked with a start had crawled out of his also be pushing apart the meeting a little and carefully drawing it together again then he had opened the trap and descended
the man and the child recognized each other silently amid the gloom montparnasse confined himself to the remark we need you
come lend us a hand
the law asked for no further enlightenment
i'm with you said he
and both took their way towards the rue saint antoine whence montparnasse had emerged winding rapidly through the long file of market gardeners' carts which descend towards the market say that your
the market gardeners crouching half asleep in their wagons amid the salads and vegetables enveloped to their very eyes in their mufflers on account of the beating rain did not even glance at these strange pedestrians
chapter iii the vicissitudes of flight this is what had taken place that same night at the la force an escape had been planned between babe tn run on fuel emer and the barrier although the barrier was in close confinement
baber had arranged the matter for his own benefit on the same day as the reader has seen from montparnasse's account to fav roche
montparnasse was to help them from outside
bruno n after having passed a month in the punishment cell had had time in the first place to weave a role in the second to mature allen
it former times those severe places where the discipline of the prison delivers the convict into his own hands were composed of four stonewall east one ceilings flagged pavement a camp bed at rated window and a door lined with iron and were called dungeons but the dungeon was judged to be too terrible nowadays they are composed of an iron doors graded windows campers a flagged pavement four stone walls and a stone ceiling and are called chambers of punishment
a little light penetrates towards midway
the inconvenient point about these chambers which as the reader sees are not dungeons is that they allow the persons who should be at work to think
so bruno i meditated and he emerged from the chamber of punishment with a rope
as he had the name of being very dangerous in the charlemagne courtyard he was placed in the new building
the first thing he found in the new building was the kemer the second was a mail fuel emer that is to say crimes nail that is to say liberty
bruno not whom it is high time that the reader should have a complete idea was with an appearance of delicate health and a profoundly premeditated languor a polished intelligent sprig and a thief who had a caressing glance and an atrocious smile
his glance resulted from his will and his smile from his nature
his first studies in his art has been directed to roofs
he had made great progress in the industry of the men who tear off leads to plunder the roofs and despoil the butters by the process called double pickings
the circumstance which put the finishing touch on the moment peculiarly favorable for an attempt at escape was that the roofers were relating andre jointing at that very moment a portion of the slates on the prison
the saint bernard courtyard was no longer absolutely isolated from the charlemagne and the saint louis courts
up above there were scaffolding's and ladders in other words bridges and stairs in the direction of liberty
the new building which was the most cracked and decrepit thing to be seen anywhere in the world was the weak point in the prison
the walls were eaten by saltpeter to such an extent that the authorities had been obliged to line the vaults of the dormitories with a sheathing of wood because stones were in the habit of becoming detached and falling on the prisoners in their free
in spite of this antiquity the authorities committed the error of confining in the new building the most troublesome prisoners of placing there the hard cases as they say in prison parlance
the new building contained four dormitories one above the other and a top story which was called the bel air fine air
a large chimney blue probably from some ancient kitchen of the dukes de la force started from the ground floor traversed all four stories cut the dormitories where it figured as a flattened pillar into two portions and finally pierced the root
the kemer and bruno'm were in the same dormitory
they had been placed by way of precaution on the lower story
chance ordained that the heads of their beds should rest against the chimney
the bad diet was directly over their heads in the top story known as fine air
the pedestrian who hairs on the rue culture sainte catherine after passing the barracks of the firemen in front of the ported of hereof the bathing establishment be holds a hard full of flowers and shrubs in wooden boxes at the extremity of which spreads out a little white rotunda with two wings brightened up with green shutters the bucolic dream of jean jacques
not more than ten years ago there rose above that rotunda an enormous black hideous bare wall by which it was backed up
this was the outer wall of la force
this wall beside that rotunda was milton viewed through bed quin
lofty as it was this walk was over topped by a still blacker roof which could be seen beyond
this was the roof of the new building
there one could dec cry four dormer windows guarded with care they were the windows of the vine air
a chimney pierced the roof this was the chimney which traversed the dormitories
the bel air that top story of the new building was a sort of large hall with a mansard roof guarded with triple gratings and double doors of sheet iron which were studded with enormous bolts
when one entered from the north end one had on one's left the four dormer windows on one's right facing the windows at regular intervals foursquare tolerably vast cages separated by narrow passages built of masonry to about the height of the elbow and the rest up to the roof of iron bars
the barrier had been in solitary confinement in one of these cages since the night of the dog february
no one was ever able to discover how and by what connivance he succeeded in procuring and secreting a bottle of wine invented so it is said by decries with which a narcotic is mixed and which the band of the end of heirs or sleep compelled's rendered famous
there are in many prisons treacherous employees half jailer's half thieves who assist in escapes who sell to the police an unfaithful service and who turn a penny whenever they can
on that same night then when little gave if he picked up the two lost children br j jon and fuel emer who knew that babe t who had escaped that morning was waiting for them in the street as well as montparnasse rose softly and with the mail which bruno n had found began to pierce the chimney against which their beds stood
the rubbish fell on fri jon's bed so that they were not heard
showers mingled with thunder shook the doors on their hinges and created in the prison a terrible and opportune uproar
those of the prisoners who woke pretended to fall asleep again and left the lens rene brun onto their own devices
bruno news adroit fuel emer was vigorous
before any sound had reached the watcher who was sleeping in the grated cell which opened into the dormitory the wall had been pierced the chimney scaled the iron grating which barred the upper orifice of the blue forced and the two redoubtable ruffians were on the roof
the wind and rain redoubled the roof was slippery
what a good night to let it
said v yukon
an abyss six feet broad and eighty feet deep separated them from the surrounding wall
at the bottom of this abyss they could see the musket of a sentinel gleaming through the gloom
they fastened one end of the rope which nru jon had spun in his dungeon to the stumps of the iron bars which they had just wrenched off flung the other over the outer wall crossed the abyss at one bound cling to the coping of the wall got a stride of it let themselves slip one after the other along the role upon a little roof which touches the bathhouse pulled their role after them jumped down into the courtyard of the bathhouse traversed it pushed open the porter's wicket beside which hung his role pulled this opened the ported of here and found themselves in the street
three quarters of an hour had not elapsed since they had risen in bed on the dark nail in hand and their project in their heads
a few moments later they had joined faber and montparnasse who were prowling about the neighborhood
they had broken their role in pulling it after them and a bit of it remained attached to the chimney on the door
they had sustained no other damage however than that of scratchy by nearly all the skin off their hands
that night the hardier was warned without anyone being able to explain how and was not asleep
towards oneo'clock in the morning the night being very dark he saw two shadows pass along the roof in the rain and squalls in front of the dormer window which was opposite his cage
one halted at the window long enough to cart in a glance
this was bruno n
the barrier recognized him and understood
this was enough
the barrier rated as a burglar and detained as a measure of precaution under the charge of organizing a nocturnal ambush with armed force was kept insight
the sentry who was relieved every two hours marched up and down in front of his cage with loaded musket
the fines it was lighted by a skylight
the prisoner had on his feet fetters weighing fifty pounds
everyday at fouro'clock in the afternoon zmailer escorted by two dogs this was still in vogue at that time entered his cage deposited beside his bed a loaf of black bread weighing two pounds a jug of water a bowl filled with rather thin bouillon in which swam a few maya range and inspected his irons and tapped the bars
this man and his dogs made two visits during the night
the barrier had obtained permission to keep a sort of iron boot which he used to spike his bread into a crack in the wall in order to preserve it from the rate as he said
as the barrier was kept in sight no objection has been made to this spike
still it was remembered afterwards that one of the jailer's had said it would be better to let him have only a wooden spike
at twoo'clock in the morning the sentinel who was an old soldier was relieved and replaced by a conscript
a few moments later the man with the dogs paid his visit and went off without noticing anything except possibly the excessive youth and the rustic air or the raw recruit
two hours afterwards at fouro'clock when they came to relieve the conscript he was found asleep on the floor lying like a lot near the barrier's cage
as for the barrier he was no longer there
there was a hole in the ceiling of his cage and above it another hole in the roof
one of the planks of his bed has been wrenched off and probably carried away with him as it was not found
they also seized in his cells half empty bottle which contained the remains of the stupefying dinesh by which the soldier had been drugged
the soldier's bayonet had disappeared
at the moment when this discovery was made it was assumed that the barrier was out of reach
the truth is that he was no longer in the new building but that he was still in great danger
the hardier in reaching the roof of the new building had found the remains of bru jon's role hanging to the bars of the upper trap of the chimney but as this broken fragment was much too short he had not been able to escape by the outer wall as bruijn and fuel else has done
when one turns from the rue des ballets into the rue du roi de sickle one almost immediately encounters a repulsive ruin
there stood on that spot in the last century a house of which only the back call now remains a regular wall of masonry which rises to the height of the third story between the adjoining buildings
this ruin can be recognized by two large square windows which are still to be seen there the middle one that nearest the right table is barred with a worm eaten beam adjusted like a prop
through these windows there was formerly visible a lofty and lugubrious wall which was a fragment of the outer wall of la force
the empty space on the street left by the demolished house is half filled by a fence of rotten boards shored up by five stone posts
in this recess lies concealed a little shanty which leans against the portion of the ruin which has remained standing
the fence has a game which a few years ago was fastened only by a latch
it was the crest of this ruin that the barrier had succeeded in reaching a little after oneo'clock in the morning
how had he got there
that is what noone has ever been able to explain or understand
the lightning must at the same time have hindered and helped him
had he made use of the ladders and scaffolding's of the skaters to get from roof to roof from enclosure to enclosure from compartment to compartment to the buildings of the charlemagne court then to the buildings of the saint louis court to the outer wall and thence to the hut on the rue du roi re sickle
but in that itinerary there existed breaks which seemed to render it an impossibility
had he placed the plank from his bed like a bridge from the roof of the fine air to the outer wall and crawled flat on his belly on the coping of the outer wall the whole distance round the prison as far as the nut
but the outer wall of la force for he was rebel later and unequal line it mounted and descended it dropped at the firemen's barracks it rose towards the bathhouse it was cut in twain by buildings it was not even if the same height on the hotell' amour non as on the rue pages everywhere of cuetec falls and right angles and then the sentinels must have espied the dark form of the fugitive hence the route taken by the barrier still remains rather inexplicable
in two manners flight was impossible
had the barrier spurred on by that thirst for liberty which changes p term life congo ditches iron bars into wattles of osier a legless man into an athlete about y man into a bird stupidity into instinct instinct into intelligence and intelligence into genius has the barrier invented a third mode
no one has ever found out
the marvels of escape can not always be accounted for
the man who makes his escape we repeat is inspired there is something of the star and of the lightning in the mysterious gleam of flight the effort towards deliverance is no less surprising that the flight towards the sublime and one says of the escaped thief how did he contrive to scale that wall
in the same way that one saga of corneille where did he find the means of dying
at all events dripping with perspiration drenched with rain with his clothes hanging in ribbons his hand delayed his elbows bleeding his knees torn the barrier had reached what children in their figurative language call the edge of the wall of the ruin there he had stretched himself out at full length and there his strength had failed him
a steep escarpment three stories high separated him from the pavement of the street
the rope which he had was too short
there he waited pale exhausted desperate with all the despair which he had undergone still hidden by the night but telling himself that the day was on the point of dawning alarmed at the idea of hearing the neighboring clock of saint paul strike four within a few minutes an hour when the sentinel was relieved and when the latter would be found asleep under the pierced roof staring in horror at a terrible depth at the light of the street lanterns the wet black pavement that pavement longed for yet frightful which meant death and which meant liberty
he asked himself whether his three accomplices in flight had succeeded if they had heard him and if they would come to his assistance
re listener
with the exception of the patrol no one had passed through the street since he had been there
nearly the whole of the descent of the market gardeners from montreuil from chat on me from vincennes and from bercy to the markets was accomplished through the rue saint antoine
fouro'clock struck
the barrier shuddered
a few moments later that terrified and confused uproar which follows the discovery of an escape broke forth in the prison
the sound of doors opening and shutting the creaking of gratings on their him he's a tumult in the guard house the hoarse shouts of the turnkey's the shock of musket butts on the pavement of the courts reached his ears
lights ascended and descended past the grated windows of the dormitories a torch ran along the ridge pole of the top story of the new building the firemen belonging in the barracks in the right had been summoned
their helmets which the torch lighter up in the rain went and came along the roofs
at the same time the hardier perceived in the direction of the bastille as an whiteness lighting up the edge of the sky in doleful wise
he was on top of a wall ten inches wide stretched out under the heavy rains with two rules to right and left unable to stir subject to the giddiness of a possible fall and to the horror of a certain arrest and his thoughts like the pendulum of a clock swing from one of these ideas to the other dead if it all caught if i stay
in the midst of this anguish he suddenly saw the street being still dark a man who was gliding along the walls and coming from the rue page shalt in the recess above which the mardi areas as it were suspended
here this man was joined by a second who walked with the same caution then by a third then by a fourth
when these men were reunited one of them listed the latch of the gate in the fence and all four entered the enclosure in which the shaggy's good
they halted directly under the bar diet
these men had evidently chosen this vacant space in order that they might consult without being seen by the passersby or by these ngi jsp who guards the wicket of la force a few paces distant
it must be added that the rain kept this sentinel blocked in his box
the barrier not being able to distinguish their visage spent a near to their words with the desperate attention of a wretch who feels himself list
the barrier saw something resembling a gleam of hope flash before his eyes these men conversed in slang
the first said in a low but distinct voice let's cut
what are we upto here
the second replied it's raining hard enough to put out the very devil's fire
and the bobbie's will be a long instant er
there's a soldier on guard yonder
we shall get nabbed here
these two words if i go and i did all of both of which mean island which belong the first to the slang of the barriers the second to the slang of the temple were flashes of light for the hardier
by the uci home recognized bruno n show as a prowler of the barriers by the icu sailor he knew babe t who among his other trades had been an old clothes broker at the temple
the antiques lang of the great century is no longer spoken except in the temple and faber was really the only person who spoke it in all its purity
had it not been for the ici caille the barrier would not have recognized him for he had entirely changed his voice
in the meanwhile the third man had intervened
there's no hurry yet let's wait a bit
how do we know that hedoesn't stand in need of us
by this which was nothing but french the nerdier recognized montparnasse who made it a point in his elegance to understand all slang sand to speak none of them
as for the fourth he held his peace but his huge shoulders betrayed him
the barrier did not hesitate
it was the kemer
bruno n replied almost impetuously but still in a low to me what are you jabbering about
the tavern keeper hasn't managed to cut his stick
hedon't tumble to the racket that hedon't
you have to be a pretty knowing five to tear up your shortcut up yours here to make a rope punch holes indoors get up false papers make false keys file your irons hang out your cord hide yourself and disguise yourself
the old fellow hasn't managed to play it bedoesn't understand how to work the business
baber added still in that classical slang which was spoken by poul willed and car touche and which is to the bold new highly colored and rick had not used by bruno n what the language of racine is to the language of andre chenier your tavern keeper must have been banged in the act
you have to be knowing
he's only a greenhorn
he must have let himself be taken in vga bobby perhaps even by a sheep who played it on him as his pal
listen montparnasse do you hear those shouts in the prison
you have seen all those lights
he's recaptured there
he'll get off with twenty years
iain'ta fraud iain'ta coward but there ain' y anything more to do or otherwise they'd lead us a dance
don' they had come with us let's go drink a bottle of old wine together
onedoesn't desert one's friends in a scrape grumbled montparnasse
i tell you he's nabbed
retorted bruno n
at the present moment the innkeeperain'ta or that a' penny
dfcan't do nothing for him
let's geoff
every minute i think a hobby has got me in his fist
montparnasse no longer offered more than a feeble resistance the fact is that these four men with the fidelity of ruffians who never abandon each other had prowled all night long about laforge great as was their peril in the hope of seeing the barrier make his appearance on the top of some wall
but the night which was really growing too fine for the downpour was such as to render all the streets deserted the cold which was overpowering them their soaked garments their hole ridden shows the alarming noise which had just burst forth in the prison the hours which had elapsed the patrol which they had encountered the hope which was vanishing all urged them to be at a retreat
montparnasse himself who was perhaps almost then archer's son in law york bed
a moment more and they would be gone
the barrier was panting on his wall like the shipwrecked sufferers of themed use on their raft when they beheld the vessel which had appeared in sight vanish on the horizon
he dared not call to them a cry might be heard and ruin everything
an idea occurred to him a last ideas flash of inspiration he drew from his pocket the end of bru jon's role which he had detached from the chimney of the new building and flung it into the space enclosed by the fence
this role fell at their feet
a widow said babe t
my tortoise
said bruno n
the tavern keeper is there said montparnasse
they raised their eyes
the barrier thrust out his head a very little
quick
said montparnasse have you the other end of the role bruno n
yes
k not the two pieces together we'll flung him the role he can taste not to the wall and he'll have enough of it to get down with
the barrier ran the risk and spoke i am paralyzed with cold
we'll warn you up
ican't budge
let yourself slide we'll catch you
my hands are bw number
only fasten the rope to the wall
ican't
then one of us must climb up said montparnasse
three stories
ejaculated bruno n
an ancient plaster blue which had served for a stove that had been used in the shanty in former times ran along the wall and mounted almost to the very spot where they could see the barrier
this bike then much damaged and full of cracks has since fallen but the marks of it are still visible
it was very narrow
one might get up by the help of that said montparnasse
by that blue
exclaimed ba beta grownups i've never
it would take a brat
a brat must be not resumed bruno n
where are we to find a young' in
said the owner
wait said montparnasse
i've got the very article
he opened the gate of the fence very softly made sure that no one was passing along the street stepped out cautiously shut the gate behind him and set of data run in the direction of the bastille
seven or eight minutes elapsed eight thousand centuries to the barrier babe thru jon and fuel emer did not open their lips at last the gate opener once more and montparnasse appeared breathless and followed by nav roche
the gain still rendered the street completely deserted
little gave if he entered the enclosure and gazed at the forms of these ruffians with a tranquil air
the water was dripping from his hair
fuel emer addressed him are you a man young' in
yafro she shrugged his shoulders and replied a young' unlike he's a man and men like you are babes
the brat's tongue's well hung
exclaimed babe t
the parish datain't made of straw added bruno n
what do you want
as keshav roche
montparnasse answered climb up that blue
with this role said babe t
and fasten it continued bruno n
to the top of the wall went on baber
to the crossbar of the window added bruno n
and then
said had roche
there
said his kemer
the gamin examined the rope the flue the wall the windows and made that indescribable and disdainful noise with his lips which signifies is that all
there'sa many others whom you are to save resumed montparnasse
will you
began bruk on again
greenhorn
replied the law as though the question appeared a most unprecedented one to him
and he took off his shoes
fuel emer seized had roche by one arm set him on the roof of the shanty whose work eaten plank event beneath the urchin's weight and handed him the rope which bruno n had knotted together during montparnasse's absence
the gamin directed his steps towards the blue which it was easy to enter thanks to a large crack which touched the good
at the moment when he was on the point of ascending the barrier who saw life and safety approaching bent over the edge of the well the first light of dawn struck white upon his brow dripping with sweat up in his livid cheekbones his sharp and savage nose his bristling gray beard and gave if he recognized him
hullo
it's my father
oh that won' thunder
and taking the role in his teeth he resolutely began the ascent
he reached the summit of the hut best rode the old wall as though it had been a horse and knotted the role firmly to the upper crossbar of the window
a moment later the barrier was in the street
as soon as he touched the pavement as soon as he found himself out of danger he was no longer either weary or chilled or trembling the terrible things from which he had escaped vanished like smoke all that strange and ferocious mind awoke once more and stood erect and free ready to march onward
these were this man's first words now whom are werke ag
it is useless to explain the sense of this frightfully transparent remark which signifies both to kill to assassinate and to plunder
to eat true sense to devour
let's get well into a corner said bruno n
let's settle it in three words and part at once
there was an affair that promised well in the rue plumer a deserted street an isolated house an old fort engage in a garden and lone women
well
why not
demanded the barrier
your girl el on one went to see about the matter replied band t
and she brought a biscuit to magnon added fuel emer
nothing to be made there
the girl's glgool said the hardier
still it must be seen to
yes yes said b run on it must be looked up
in the meanwhile none of the men seemed to see had roche who during this colloquy had seated himself on one of the fence posts he waited a few moments thinking that perhaps his father would turn towards him then he put on his shoes again and said is that all
youdon''t want anymore my msn
now you're out if your scrape
i'm off
i must go and get my beats out of bed
and of the seng
the five men emerged one after another from the enclosure
when gave if he had disappeared at the corner of the rue des ballet sba net took the barrier aside
did you take a good look at that young' in
he asked
what young' in
the one who climbed the wall and carried you the rope
not particularly
well idon't know but it strikes me that it was your son
bah
said then sexier do you think so

where are we at this moment
in the land of slang
what is slang
it is a tone and the same time a nation and a dialect it is theft in its two kinds people and language
when four and thirty years ago the narrator of this grave and sombre history introduced into a work written with the same aimed this a thief who talked at got there arose amazement and clamor

it is the language of prisons galleys convicts of everything that is most abominable in society

people repeated what do authors mean by that revolting dialect
slang is odious
slang makes one shudder
who denies that
of course it does
when it is a question of proving a wounds gulf a society since when basic been considered wrong to go too far
to go to the bottom
we have always thought that it was sometimes a courageous act and at least a simple and useful deed worthy of the sympathetic attention which duty accepted and fulfilled merits
why should one not explore everything and study everything
why should one half on the way
the half is a matter depending on the sounding line and not on the leads man
certainly too it is neither an attractive not an easy task to undertake an investigation into the lowest depths of the social order where terra firma comes to amend and where mud begins to rummage in those vague murky waves to follow up to seize and to doing still shivering upon the pavement that abject dialect which is dripping with filth when this brought to the light that push up our vocabulary each word of which seems an unclean ring from a monster of the mute and the shadows
nothing is more lugubrious than the contemplation thus in its nudity in the broad light of thought of the horrible swarming of slang
it seems in fact to be a sort of horrible beast made for the night which has just been torn from its cesspool
one thinks one he holds a frightful living and bristling thicket which quivers rustle saavers returns to shadow threatens and flares
one word resembles a claw another an extinguished and bleeding eye such and such a phrase seems to move like the claw of a crab
all this is alive with the hideous vitality of things which have been organized out of disorganization
now when has horror ever excluded study
since when has malady banished medicine
can one imagine a naturalist refusing to study the viper then at the scorpion the centipede the tarantula and one who would cast them back into their darkness saying oh
how ugly that is
the thinker who should turn aside from slang would resemble a surgeon who should a very his face from an ulcer or a wart
he would be like a philologist refusing to examine a fact in languages philosopher hesitating to scrutinize a fact inhumanity
for it must be stated to those who are ignorant of the case that we got is both a literary phenomenon and a social result
what is slang properly speaking
it is the language of wretchedness
we may be stopped the fact may be put to us in general terms which is one way of attenuating if we may be told that all trades professions it may be added all the accidents of the social hierarchy and all forms of intelligence have their own slang

no doubt
but say what we will this manner of understanding the word slang is an extension which everyone will not admit
for our part we reserve to the word its ancient and precise circumscribed and determines significance and we restrict slang to slang
the veritable slang and the slang that is pre eminently slang if the two words can be coupled thus the slang immemorial which was a kingdom is nothing else we repeat than the homely in each crafty treacherous venomous cruel equivocal file profound fatal tongue of wretchedness
there exists at the extremity of all's basement and all misfortune as last misery which revolts and makes up its mind to enter into conflict with the whole mass of fortunate facts and reigning rights a fearful conflict where to a cunning now violent unhealthy and ferocious a fine and the same time it attacks the social order with pinprick's through vice and with club blows through crime
to meet the needs of this conflict wretchedness has invented a language of combat which is slang
to keep afloat and to rescue from oblivion to hold above the gulf were it but a fragment of some language which man has spoken and which would otherwise be lost that is to say one of the elements good or bad of which civilization is composed or by which it is complicated to extend the records of social observation is to serve civilization itself
this service plautus rendered consciously or unconsciously by making two carthaginian soldiers talk phoenician that service moliere rendered by making so many of his characters talk levantine and all sorts of dialects
here objections spring up a fresh
phoenician very good
levantine quite right
even dialect let that pass
they are tongues which have belonged to nations or provinces but slang
what is the use of preserving slang
what is the good of assisting slang to survive
to this we reply in one word only
assuredly of the tongue which a nation or a province has spoken is worthy of interest the language which has been spoken by a misery is still more worthy of attention and study
it is the language which has been spoken in france for example for more than four centuries not only by a misery but by every possible human misery
and then we insist upon it the study of social deformities and infirmities and the task of pointing them out with a view to remedy is not's business in which choice is permitted
the historian of manners and ideas has no less austere a mission than the historian of events
the latter has the surface of civilization the conflicts of crowns the births of princes the marriage workings battles assemblages great public men revolutions in the daylight everything on the exterior the other historian has the interior the depths the people who toil auf der welt the oppressed woman the agonizing child the secret war between man and man obscure feel cities prejudices plotted iniquities the subterranean the indistinct tremors of multitudes the die of hunger the counter blows of the law the secret evolution of souls the go barefoot the far earned the disinherited the orphans the unhappy and the infamous all the forms which roam through the darkness
he must descend with his heart full of charity and severity at the same time as a brother and as a judge to those impenetrable case mates where crawl pell help those who bleed and those who feel the blow those who deep and those who curse those who fast and those who devour those who endure evil and those who inflict it
have these historians of hearts and soul's duties at all inferior to the historians of external facts
does anyone think that alighieri has any fewer things to say than machiavelli
is the underside of civilization any less important than the upper side merely because it is deeper and more sombre
do we really know the mountain well when we are not acquainted with the cavern
let us say moreover parent medically that from a few words of what precedes a marked separation might be inferred between the two classes of historians which does not exist in our mind
no one is a good historian of the patent visible striking and public life of peoples if he is not at the same time in a certain measure the historian of their deep and hidden life and no one is a good historian of the interior unless he understands today need to be the historian of the exterior also
the history of manners and ideas permeates the history of events and this is true reciprocally
they constitute two different orders of facts which correspond to each other which are always interlaced and which often bring forth results
all the lineaments which providence traces on the surface of a nation have their parallels sombre but distinct in their depths and all convulsions of the depths produce ebullition's on the surface
true history being a mixture of all things the true historian mingled in everything
man is not a circle with a single centre he is an ellipse with a double focus
facts form one of these and ideas the other
slang is nothing but a dressing room where the tongue having some bad action to perform disguises itself
there it clothes itself in word masks in metaphor tags
in this guide it becomes horrible
one finds it difficult to recognize
is it really the french tongue the great human tongue
behold it ready to step up on the stage and to retort upon crime and prepared for all the employments of the repertory of evil
it no longer walks it hobbies it lumps on the crutch of the court of miracles a crutch metamorph is able into a club it is called vagrancy every sort of spectre its dressers have painted it's face it crawls and reads the double gait of the reptile
henceforth it is apt at all roles it is made suspicious by the counterfeited covered with verdigris by the forget blacked by the spot of the incendiary and the murderer applies its rouge
when one listens by the side of honest men at the portals of society one overheard the dialogues of those who are on the outside
one distinguishes questions and replies
one perceives without understanding of a hideous murmur sounding almost like human accents but more nearly resembling a bowl than an articulate word
it is slang
the words are misshapen and stamped with an indescribable and fantastic bestiality
one thinks one year's hydra stalking
it is unintelligible in the dark

chapter ii roots slang is the tongue of those who sit in darkness
thought is moved in its most sombre depths social philosophy is bidden to its most poignant meditations on the presence of that enigmatic dialect at once so blighted and rebellious
therein lies chastisement made visible
every syllable has an air of being marked
the words of the vulgar tongue appear there in wrinkled and shrivelled as it were beneath the hot iron of the executioner
some seem to be still smoking
such and such a phrase produced upon you the effect of the shoulder of a thief branded with the fleur de lys which has suddenly been laid bare
ideas almost refuse to be expressed in these substantive's which are fugitives from justice
metaphor is sometimes so shameless that one feels that it has worn the iron neck better
moreover in spite of all this and because of all this this strange dialect tawny rights its own compartment in that great impartial case of pigeon holes where there is room for the rusty farthing as well as for the gold medal and which is called literature
slang whether the public admit the fact of both as its syntax and its poetry
it is a language

from a purely literary point of view few studies would prove more curious and fruitful than the study of slang
it is a whole language within a languages sort of sicily east essence an unhealthy graft which has produced a vegetation a parasite which has its roots in the old gallic trunk and whose sinister foliage crawls all over one side of the language
this is what may be called the first the vulgar aspect of slang

in addition to the philological origins just indicated slang possesses oh use and still more natural roots which spring so to speak from the kind of man itself
in the first place the direct creation of words
therein lies the mystery of tongues
to paint with words which contains figures one knows not how or why is the primitive foundation of all human languages what may be called their granite
slang abounds in words of this description immediate words words created instantaneously no one knows either where or by whom without etymology without analogies without derivatives solitary barbarous sometimes hideous words which at times possess a singular power of expression and which live
the executioner let ails the forest less brits are light had the lack rule larg in the mineral the prefect the minister pharos the devillers boy in
nothing is stranger than these words which both mask and reveal
some of rank him for example are at the same time grotesque and terrible and produce on you the effect of a cyclops an grimace
in the second place metaphor
the peculiarity of a language which is desirous of saying all yet concealing all is that it is rich in figures
metaphor is an enigma wherein the thief who is plotting a stroke the prisoner who is arranging an escape take refuge
no idiom is more metaphorical than slang de visser lexico to unscrew the button wish the neck for tiller to wriggle to date freyer be to be tried a data bread this fill an equine it rains a striking ancient figure which partly bears its date about it which assimilates long oblique lines of rain with the dense and slanting likes of the lancers and which compressed into a single word the popular expression of rain anal feeds
some times in proportion as slang progresses from the first epoch to the second words pass from the primitive and savage sense to the metaphorical sense
the devil ceases to be perabo him and becomes le boulanger the baker who puts the bread into the oven
this is more witty but less grand something like racine after corneille like euripides after aeschylus
certain slant phrases which participate in the two epochs and have at once the barbaric character and the metaphorical character resemble phantasm stories
lessor gushers fonts illicit wed details apa line the prowlers are going to steal horses by night this passes before the mind like a group of spectres
one knows not what one sees
in the third place the expedient
slang lives on the language
it uses it in accordance with its fancy it dips into it haphazard and it often confines itself when occasion arises to alter it in a gross and summary fashion
occasionally with the ordinary words thus deformed and complicated with words of pure slang picturesque phrases are formed in which there can be felt the mixture of the two preceding elements the direct creation and the metaphor less by a spindle martin new url atom porte de panting time dans les a bridge dog is barking i suspect that the diligence for paris is passing through the woods
leda best sindelar a huge esther loussier else sees that ive the bourgeoisie stupid the bourgeois eis cunning the daughter is pretty
generally to throw listeners off the tracks lang confines itself to adding to all the words of the language without distinction an ignoble tails termination in will do not rubin is true or in uche
this vous i erfurt dougall le bon or guffey i got much e.
do you think that leg of mutton good
a phrase addressed by cartouche to a turnkey in order to find out whether the sum offered for his escape suited him
the termination kumar has been added recently
slang being the dialect of corruption quickly becomes corrupted itself
besides this as it is always seeking concealment as soon as it feels that it is understood it changes its form
contrary to what happens with every other vegetation every day of light which falls upon it kills whatever it touches
this slang is in constant process of decomposition and decomposition an obscure and rapid work which never pauses
it passes over more ground in ten years than a language in ten centuries

in the seventeenth century to fight was to give each other snuff in the nineteenth it is to chew each other's throats
there have been twenty different phrases between these two extremes
cartouche's talk would have been hebrew to laden air f
all the words of this language are perpetually engaged in flight like the men who utter them
still from time to time and in consequence of this very movement the ancient slang crops up again and become a new once more
it has its headquarters where it maintains its away
the temple preserved the slang of the seventeenth century bid et de when it was a prison preserved the slant of thymes
there one could hear the termination in anche of the old thu neues
boy and he stub list i do you drink
but perpetual movement remains it's law nevertheless
if the phipps olney succeeds in fixing for a moment for purposes of observation this language which is incessantly evaporating he falls into doleful and useful meditation
no study is more efficacious and more fecund in instruction
there is not a metaphor not an analogy in slang which does not contain a lesson

a man under arrest is a sick man one who is condemned is a deadman
the most terrible thing for the prisoner within the four walls in which he is buried is a sort of glacial chastity and he calls the dungeon the cactus
in that fund real place life outside always presents itself under its most smiling aspect
the prisoner has irons on his feet you think perhaps that his thought is that it is with the feet that one walls
note is thinking that it is with the feet that one dances so when he has succeeded in severing his fetters his first idea is that how he can dance and he calls the saw the gastrin the public house ball

when a man has no longer anything but days upon his body and vices in his heart when he has arrived at that double moral and material degradation which the word blackguard characterized in its two acceptation she is ripe for crime he is like a well whether knife he has two cutting edges his distress and his malice so slang does not say a blackguard it says in teguise
what are the galleys
a brazier of damnation shell
the convict calls himself a favor
and finally what name donald factors give to their prison
the college
a whole penitentiary system can be evolved from that word
does the reader wish to know where the majority of the songs of the galleys those refrains called in the special vocabulary our linda have had their birth
let him listen to what follows there existed at the chatelet in paris a large and long cellar
this cellar was eight feet below the level of the seine
it had neither windows nor air holes its only aperture was the door men could enter there air could not
this vault had for ceiling a vault of stone and for floor ten inches of our
it was flagged but the pavement had rotted and cracked under the oozing of the water
eight feet above the floor along and massive beam traversed this subterranean excavation from side to side from this beam hung at short distances a part chains three feet long and at the end of these chains there were rings for the neck
in this vault men who had been condemned to the valleys were incarcerated until the day of their departure for toulon
they were thrust under this beam where each one found his better's swinging in the darkness and waiting for him
the chains those pendant arms and the necklets those open hands caught the unhappy wretches by the throat
they were diverted and left there
as the chain was too short they could not lie down
they remained motionless in that cavern inc vat night beneath that beam almost hanging forced to unheard of efforts to reach their breadth for their fault overhead mud even to midler filth flowing to their very calves broken asunder with fatigue with thighs and knees giving way clinging fast to the chain with their hands in order to obtain some rest unable to sleep except when standing erect and awakened every moment by the strangling of the collar some woke no more
in order to eat they pushed the bread which was flung to them in the mud along their leg with their heel until it reached their hand
how long did they remain this
one month two months six months sometimes one stayed a year
it was the antechamber of the galleys
men were put there for stealing share from the king
in this sepulchre tell what did they do
what man can do in a sepulchre they went through the agonies of death and what can mando in hell they sang for song lingers where there is no longer any hope
in the waters of malta when a galley was approaching the song could be heard before the sound of the oars
poor sur vincent the poacher who had gone through the prison cellar of the chatelet said it was the rhymes that kept me up
uselessness of poetry
what is the good of rhyme
it is in this cellar that nearly all the slang songs had their birth
it is from the dungeon of the grand chatelet of paris that comes the melancholy refrain of the montgomery halley time lou miss one tim all unison
the majority of these ic ic will west la theatre here is the theatre du petit warrant
of the little archer cupid
do what you will you can not annihilate that eternal relic in the heart of man love
in this world of dismal deeds people keep their secrets
the secret is the thing above all others
the secret in the eyes of these wretches is unity which serves as a base of union
to betray a secret is to hear from each member of this fierce community something of his own personality
to inform against in the energetic slang dialect is called to eat the bih
as though the informer drew to himself a little of the substance of all and nourished himself on a bit of each one's flesh
what does it signify to receive a box on the ear
commonplace metaphor replies it is to see thirtysix candles
here slang intervenes and takes it up candle camo ufo e
thereupon the ordinary tongue gives can outlet as the synonym for souffle t
thus by a sort of infiltration from below upwards with the aid of metaphor that incalculable trajectory slang mounts from the cavern to the academy and poul ziller saying i light my camo ufo e causes voltaire to write langle biella beau melle deserves a hundred dam outlets
researches in slang mean discoveries at every step
study and investigation of this strange idiom lead to the mysterious point of intersection of regular society with society which is accursed
the thief also has his food for cannon steal able letter you i whoever passes by lelant re

that the thinking principle of man be thrust down ever so low that it can be dragged and pinion ed thereby obscure tyrannies of fatality that it can be bound by no one knows what fetters in that abyss is sufficient to create consternation

will she forever summoning a into her assistance the lance of light of the ideal
issue condemned to hear the fearful approach of evil through the density of the gulf and to catch glimpses nearer and near death and beneath the hideous water of that dragon's head that has streaked with foam and that writhing undulation of class dwellings and rings
must it remain there without a gleam of light without hope given over to that terrible approach vaguely scented out by the monster shuddering dishevelled wringing its arms forever chained to the rock of nights sombre andromeda white and naked amid the shadows
chapter iii slang which seeps and slang which laugh was the reader perceives slang in its entirety slang of four hundred years ago like the slang of today is permeated with that sombre symbolical spirit which gives to all words amish which is now mournful now menacing
one feels in it the wild and ancient sadness of those vagrants of the court of miracles who played at cards with packs of their own some of which have come down to us
the right of clubs for instance represented a huge tree bearing eight enormous trefoil leaves a sort of fantastic personification of the forest
at the foot of this trees fire was burning over which three gates were roasting a huntsman on a spit and behind him on another fire hung screaming pot whence emerged the head of a dog
nothing can be more melancholy than these reprisals in painting by a lack of cards in the presence of stakes for the roasting of smugglers and of the cauldron for the boiling of counterfeiters
the diverse forms assumed by thought in the realm of slang evensong event will dry even menace all partook of this powerless and dejected character
all the songs the melodies of some of which have been collected were humble and lamentable to the point of evoking years
the petre is always the poor petre and he is always they are in hiding the fugitive mouse the flying bird
he hardly complain she contents himself with signing one of mismo and has come down to us i do not understand how god the father of men can torture his children and his grandchildren and hear them cry without himself suffering torture

towards the middle of the last century a change took place prison songs and thieves' fit our nelles assumed so to speak an insolent and jovial mien
the plaintive ma life was replaced by the park fla.
we find in the eighteenth century in nearly all the songs of the valleys and prisons a diabolical and enigmatic al gayety

this was sung in a cellar or in a book of the forest while cutting a man's throat
a serious symptom
in the eighteenth century the ancient melancholy of the rejected classes vanishes
they began to laugh
they rally the grand men and the granada b
given louis xv
they call the king of france le marquis de pantin
and behold they are almost gay
a sort of bleak proceeds from these miserable wretches as though their consciences were not heavy within the many more
these lamentable tribes of darkness have no longer merely the desperate audacity of actions they possess the heedless audacity of mind
a sign that they are losing the sense of their criminality and that they feel even among thinkers and dreamers some indefinable support which the latter themselves know not of
a sign that theft and pillage are beginning to filter into doctrines and sophie main such a way as to lose somewhat of their ugliness while communicating much of it to sophie me and doctrines
a sign in short of some outbreak which is prodigious and near unless some diversion shall arise
let us pause a moment
who made e f accusing here
is it the eighteenth century
is it philosophy
certainly not
the work of the eighteenth century is healthy and good and wholesome
the encyclopedia us diderot at their hear the physio crates turgot at their head the philosophers voltaire at their head the utopian's rousseau at their head these are four sacred legions
humanity's immense advance towards the light is due to them
they are the four vanguards of the human race marching towards the four cardinal points of progress
diderot towards the beautiful turgot towards the useful voltaire towards the true rousseau towards the just
but by the side of and above the philosophers there were the sophists a venomous vegetation mingled with a healthy growth hemlock in the virgin forest
while the executioner was burning the great books of the liberators of the century on the grand staircase of the courthouse writers now forgotten were publishing with the king's sanction no one knows what strangely did organizing writings which were eagerly read by the unfortunate
some of these publications odd to say which were patronized by a prince are to be found in the secret library
these facts significant but unknown were imperceptible on the surface
sometimes in the very obscurity of a fact lurks its danger
it is obscure because it is underhand
of all these writers the one who probably then excavated in the masses the most unhealthy gallery wasted to feel a breton nf
this work peculiar to the whole of europe effected more ravages in germany than anywhere else
in germany during a given period summed up by schiller in his famous drama the robbers theft and pillage rose up in protest against property and labor assimilated certain specious and false elementary ideas which though just in appearance were absurd in reality enveloped themselves in these ideas disappeared within the matters fashion assumed an abstract name passed into the state of theory and in that shape circulated among the laborious suffering and honest masses unknown even to the imprudent chemists who had prepared the mixture unknown even to the masses who accepted it
whenever a fact of this sort presents itself the case is grave
suffering engenders death and while the prosperous classes blind themselves or fall asleep which is the same thing ass hugging one's eyes the hatred of the unfortunate classes lights its torch at some aggrieved or ill made spirit which dreams in a corner and sets itself to the scrutiny of society
the scrutiny of hatred is a terrible thing
hence if the ill fortune of the times so will sit those fearful com motions which were formerly called mac queries beside which purely political agitations are the merest child's play which are no longer the conflict of the oppressed and the oppressor but the revolt of discomfort against comfort
then everything crumbles
mac queries are earthquakes of the people
it is this peril possibly imminent towards the close of the eighteenth century which the french revolutio h. that immense act of probity cut short
the french revolution which is nothing else than the idea armed with the sword rose erect and with the same abrupt movement closed the door of ill and opened the door of good
it out a stop to torture promulgated the truth expelled miasma rendered the century healthy crowned the populace
it may be said of it that it created man a second time by giving him a second soul the right
the nineteenth century has inherited and profited by its work and today the social catastrophe to which we lately alluded is simply impossible
bound is he who announces it
foolish is he who fears it
revolution is the vaccine of jacque rie
thanks to the revolution social conditions have changed
feudal and monarchical maladies no longer run on our blood
there is no more of the middle ages in our constitution
we no longer live in the days when terrible swarms within made i eruptions when one heard beneath his feet the obscure course of a full rumble when indescribable elevations from mole like tunnels appeared on the surface of civilization where the soil cracked open where the roots of caverns yawned and where one suddenly be held monstrous heads emerging from the earth
the revolutionary sense is a moral sense
the sentiment of right once developed develops the sentiment of duty
the law of all is liberty which ends where the liberty of others begins according to robespierre's admirable definition
since' the whole people has been dilating into a sublime individual there is not a poor man who possessing his right has not his day of sun the die of hunger feels within him the honesty of france the dignity of the citizen is an internal armor he who is free iss cd you like he who votes reigns
hence in corrupt ibility hence the miscarriage of unhealthy lists hence eyes heroically powered before temptations
the revolutionary wholesomeness is such that of a day of deliverance a type july art of august there is no longer any populace
the first cry of the enlightened and increasing throngs is death to thieves
progress is an honest man the ideal and the absolute do not filch pocket handkerchiefs
by whom were the wagons containing the wealth of the tuileries es forged in
by the day pickers of the faubourg saint antoine
tags mounted guard over the treasure
virtue rendered these rated edema lions resplendent
in those wagons in chests hardly closed and some even half open amid a hundred dazzling caskets was that ancient crown of france studded with diamonds surmounted by the carbuncle of royalty by the regent diamond which was worth thirty millions
barefooted they guarded that crown
hence no more jacque rie
i regret it for the sake of the skilful
the old fear has produced its last effects in that quarter and henceforth it can no longer be employed in politics
the principal spring of the red spectre is broken
everyone knows it now
the scarecrows cards no longer
the birds take liberties with the man nikon fm up creatures a light upon or the bourgeois laugh at it
chapter iv the two duties to watch and to hope this being the case is all social danger dispelled
certainly not
there is no jacque die society may rest assured on that point blood will no longer rush to its head
but let society take heed to the manner in which it breathes
apoplexy is no longer to be feared but on this is is there
social on this is is called misery
one can perish from being undermined as well as from being struck by lightning
let us not weary of repeating and sympathetic souls must not forget that this is the first of fraternal obligations and selfish hearts must understand that the first of political necessities consists in thinking first of all of the disinherited and sorrowing throng sins placing airing enlightening loving them in enlarging their horizon to a magnificent extent in lavishing upon them education in every form in offering them the example of labor never the example of idleness in diminishing the individual burden by ej part img the notion of the universal simon setting a limit to poverty without setting a limit to wealth in creating vast fields of public and popular activity in having like briard is a hundred hands to extend in all directions to the oppressed and the feeble in employing the collective power for that grand duty of opening workshops for all arms schools for all aptitudes and laboratories for all degrees of intelligence in augmenting salaries diminishing trouble balancing what should be and what is that is to say in proportioning enjoyment to effort and about to need in a word in evolving from the social apparatus more light and more comfort for the benefit of those who suffer and those who are ignorant
and let us say it all this is but the beginning
the true question is this labor can not be a law without being a right
we will not insist upon this point this is not the proper place for that
if nature calls itself providence society should call itself foresight
intellectual and moral growth is no less indispensable than material improvement

let us enter equal complaint against stomachs and minds which do not eat
if there is anything more heartbreaking than a body perishing for lack of bread it is a soul which is dying from hunger for the light
the whole of progress tends in the direction of solution
someday we shall be amazed
as the human race mounts upward the deep layers emerge naturally from the zone of distress
the obliteration of misery will be accomplished by a simple elevation of level
we should do wrong were we to doubt this blessed consummation
the past is very strong it is true at the present moment
it censures
this rejuvenation of a corpse is surprising
behold it is walking and advancing
it seems a victory his dead body is a conqueror
he arrives with his legions superstitions with his sword despotism with his banner ignorance awhile ago he won ten battles

let us not despair in our side
let us sell the field on which hannibal is encamped

no such thing as a backflow of ideas exists any more than there exists a return of a river on its course
but let those who do not desire a future reflect on this matter
when they say no to progress it is not the future cut themselves that they are condemning
they are giving themselves as a dma lady they are inoculating themselves with the past
there is but one way of rejecting tomorrow and that is to die
now no death that of the body as late as possible that of the soul never this is what we desire

aided by science which comes from one man and by the event which comes from another it is not greatly alarmed by these contradictions in the attitude of problems which seem impossibilities to the vulgar here
it is no less skilful at causing a solution to spring forth from the reconciliation of ideas than a lesson from the reconciliation of facts and we may expect anything from that mysterious power of progress which brought the orient and the occident face to face one fine day in the depths of a sepulchre and made the im aims converse with bonaparte in the interior of the great pyramid
in the meantime let there be no halt no hesitation no pause in the gray those onward march of minds
social philosophy consists essentially in science and peace
its object is and its result must be to dissolve wrath by the study of antagonisms
it examines it scrutinizes it analyzes then it puts together once more it proceeds by means of reduction discarding all hatred
more than once a society has been seen to give way before the wind which is let loose upon mankind history is full of the shipwrecks of nations and empires manners customs laws religions and some fine day that unknown force the hurricane passes by and bears them all away

why
we know not
what are the causes of these disasters
we do not know
could these societies have been saved
was it their fault
did they persist in the fatal vice which destroyed them
what is the amount of suicide in these terrible deaths of a nation and a race
questions to which there exists no reply
darkness en wraps condemned civilizations
they sprung a leak then they sank
we have nothing more today and it is with a sort of terror that we look on at the bottom of that sea which is called the past behind those colossal waves at the shipwreck of those immense vessels babylon nineveh tarsus the best one beneath the fearful gusts which emerge from all the mouths of the shadows
but shadows are there and light is here

book eighth
enchantments and desolation's chapter i full light the reader has probably understood that do on one having recognized through the gate the inhabitant of that the plumer whither magnon had sent her had begun by keeping the ruffians away from the rue plumer and had then conducted marius thither and that after many days spent in ecstasy before that gate marius drawn on by that force which draws their onto the magnet and a lover towards the stones of which is built the house of her whom he loves had finally entered cosette's garden as romeo entered the garden of juliet
this had even proved easier for him than for romeo romeo was obliged to scale as all marius had only to use a little force on one of the bars of the decrepit gate which vacillate digits rusty recess after the fashion of old people's teeth
marius was slender and readily passed through
as there was never anyone in the street and as marius never entered the garden except at night he can no risk of being seen
beginning with that blessed and holy hour when a kiss betrothed these two souls marius was there every evening
if at that period of her existence cosette had fallen in love with a man in the least unscrupulous or debauched she would have been lost for there are generous nature's which yield themselves and cosette was one of them
one of woman's magnani movies kato yield
love at the height where it is absolute is complicated with some indescribably celestial blindness of modesty
but what dangers you run knob of souls
often you give the heart and we take the body
your heart remains with you you gaze upon it in the gloom with a shudder
love has no middle course it either ruins of it saves
all human destiny lies in this dilemma
this dilemma ruin or safety is set forth no more inexorably by any fatality than by love
love is life of it is not death
cradle also coffin
the same sentiment says he's and join the human heart
of all the things that god has made the human heart is the one which sheds the most light alas
and the most darkness
god willed that cosette'd love should encounter one of the lives which sage
throughout the whole of the month of mayor that year there were there in every night in that poor neglected garden beneath that thicket which grew thicker and more fragrant day by day two beings composed of all chastity all innocence overflowing with all the felicity of heaven nearer to the archangels than to mankind pure honest intoxicated radiant shoshone for each other amid the shadows
it seemed to cosette that marius had a crown and to marius that cosette had a nimbus
they touched each other they gazed at each other they clasped each other's hands they pressed close to each other but there was a distance which they did not pass
not that they respected if they did not know of its existence
marius was conscious of a barrier cosette's innocence and cosette of a support marius' loyalty
the first kiss had also been the last
marius since that time had not gone further than to touch cost rtd's hand other kerchief or a lock of her hair with his lips
for him cosette was a perfume and not a woman
he inhaled her
she refused nothing and he asked nothing
cosette was happy and marius was satisfied
they lived in this ecstatic state which can be described as the dazzling of one soul by another soul
it was the ineffable first embrace of two maiden could in the ideal
two swans meeting on the jungfrau
at that hour of love an hour when voluptuousness is absolutely huge beneath the omnipotence of ecstasy marius the pure and seraphic marius would rather have done to a woman of the town than have raised cosette's robe to the height of her ankle
once in the moonlight cosette stooped to pick up something on the ground herb price fell apart and permitted a glimpse of the beginning of her throat
marius turned away his eyes
what took place between these two beings
high inn
they adored each other
at night when they were there that garden seemed a living and a sacred spot
all flowers unfolded around them and sent them incense and they opened their souls and scattered them over the flowers
the wanton and vigorous vegetation quivered full of strength and intoxication around these two innocents and they uttered words of love which set the trees to trembling
what words were these
breaths
nothing more
these breaths sufficed to trouble and to touch all nature roundabout
magic power which we should find it difficult to understand were we to read in a book these conversations which are made to be borne away and dispersed like smoke wreaths by the breeze beneath the leaves
take from those murmurs of two lovers that melody which proceeds from the soul and which accompanies them like a pure and what remains is nothing more than a shade you say what
is that all
eh
yes childish prattle repetition slaughter at nothing nonsense everything that is deepest and most sublime in the world
the only g kings which are worth the trouble of saying and hearing
the man who has never heard the man who has never uttered these absurdities these paltry remarks is an imbecile and a malicious fellow
rosette said to marina dost thou know
in all this and athwart this celestial maiden lines's and without either of them being able to say how it had come about they had begun to call each other thou
dost thou know
my name is euphrasia
e up tracie
why not my name is flee the
oh
cosette is a very ugly name that was given to me when i was a little thing
but my real name is sup tracie
dost thou like that gamer ultra she
yes
but cosette is not ugly
do you like it better than sup tracie
why yes
then i like it better too
truly it is pretty cosette
call me cosette
and the smile that she added made of this dialogue enid to worthy of a grove situated in heaven
in another occasion she gazed intently at him and exclaimed monsieur you are handsome you are good looking you are witty you are not at all stupid you are much more learned than i am bit ibid you defiance with this word i love you
and marius in the very heavens thought he heard a strain sung by a star
or she bestowed on him a gentle two because he coughed and she said to himdon't coughs if i will not have people count on my domain without my permission
it's very naughty to cough and to disturb me
i want you to be well because in the first place if you were not well i should be very unhappy
what should i do then
and this was simply divine
once marius said to cosette just imagine i thought stone time that your name was je suis
this made both of them laugh the whole evening
in the middle of another conversation he chanced to exclaim oh
one day at the luxembourg i had a good mind to finish breaking up a veteran
but he stopped short and went no further
he would have been obliged to speak to cosette other garter and that was impossible
this bordered in a strange theme the flesh before which that immense and innocent love recoiled with a sort of sacred fright
marius pictures life with cosette to himself like this without anything else to come every evening to the fuel limey to displace the old and accommodating bar of the chief justice's gate to sit elbow to elbow on that bench to gaze through the trees at the scintillation of the oncoming night for its role of the knee of his trousers into the ample hall of cosette's gown to caress her thumbnail to call her thou to smell of the same flower one after the other forever indefinitely
during this time clouds passed above their heads
every time that the wind blows it bears with it more of the dreams of men than of the clouds of heaven
this chaste almost's my life was not devoid of gallantry by any means
to pay compliments to the woman whom a man loves is the first method of bestowing caresses and he is half audacious who tries in
a compliment is something like a kiss through a veil
voluptuousness mingles there with its sweet tiny point while it gives itself
the heart draws back before voluptuousness only to love the more
marius' blandishments all saturated with fancy were so to speak of azure the
the birds when they fly up yonder in the direction of the angels must hear such words
there were mingled with them nevertheless life humanity all the positive news of which marius was capable
it was what is said in the bowers prelude to what will be said in the chamber a lyrical effusion at top brands on net intermingled pleasing hyper hopes of coping all the refinements of adoration arranged in a bouquet and exhaling a celestial perfume an ineffable twitter of heart to heart
oh
murmured marius how beautiful you are
i dare not look at you
it is all over with me when i contemplate you
you are a grace
i know not what is the matter with me
the hem of your gown when the top of your shoe peeps from beneath upsets me
and then what an enchanted gleam when you open your thought even buy a little
you talk astonishingly good sense
it seems to me at times that you are a dream
apexi i listen i admire
oh cosette
how strange it is and how charming
i am really beside myself
you are adorable mademoiselle
istudy your feet with the microscope and your soul with the telescope
and cosette answered i have been living a little more all the time that has passed since this morning
questions and replies took care of themselves in this dialogue which always turned with mutual consent upon live as the little putt figures always turn on their peg
cosette's whole person was ingenuous news ingenuity transparency whiteness candor radiance
it might have been said of cosette that she was clear
she produced on those who saw her the sensation of april and dawn
there was dew in her eyes
cosette was a condensation of the auroral light in the form of a woman
it was quite simple that marius should admire her since he adored her
but the truth is that this little schoolgirl fresh from the convent talked with exquisite penetration and uttered at times all sorts of true and delicate sayings
hf for style was conversation
she never made a mistake about anything and she saw things justly
the woman feels and speaks with the tender instinct of the heart which is infallible
no one understands so well as a woman how to say things that are at once both sweet and deep
sweetness and depth they are the whole of woman in them lies the whole of heaven
in this full felicity tears welled up to their eyes every instant
a crushed ladybug a feather fallen from a nest a branch of hawthorn broken aroused their pity and their ecstasy sweetly mingled with melancholy seemed to ask nothing better than to weep
the most sovereign symptom of life is a tenderness that is at times almost unrwa table
and in addition to this all these contradictions are the lightning play of love they were fond of laughing they laughed readily and with a delicious freedom and so familiarly that they sometimes presented the air of two boys
still though unknown to hearts intoxicated with purity nature is always present and will not be forgotten
she is there with her brutal and sublime object and however great may be the innocence of souls one feels in the most modest private interview the adorable and mysterious shade which separates a couple of lovers from a pair of friends
they idolized each other
the permanent and the immutable are persistent
people live they smile they laugh they make little grimaces with the tips of their lips they interlace their fingers they call each other thou and that does not prevent eternity
two lovers hide themselves in the evening in the twilight in the invisible with the birds with the roses they fascinate each other in the darkness with their hearts which they throw into their eyes they murmur they whisper and in the meantime immense lib rations of the planets fill the infinite universe
chapter ii the bewilderment of perfect happiness they existed vaguely frightened at their happiness
they did not notice the cholera which decimated paris precisely during that very month
they had confided in each other as far as possible but this had not extended much further than their names
marius had told cosette that he was an orphan that his name was marius pont mercy that he was a lawyer that he lived by writing things for publishers that his father had been a colonel that the latter had been a hero and that he marius was on bad terms with his grandfather who was rich
he had also hinted at being a baron but this has produced no effect on cosette
she did not know the meaning of the word
marius was marika
on her side she had confided to him that she had been brought up at the petit pic pic convent that her mother like his own was dead that her father's name wash
faux url event that he was very good that he gave a great deal to the poor but that he was poor himself and that he denied himself everything though he denied her nothing
strange to say in the sort of symphony which marius had lived since he has been in the habit of seeing cosette the past even the most recent past had become so confused and distant to him that what cosette told him satisfied him completely
it did not even occur to him to tell her about the nocturnal adventure in the novel about the barrier about the burn and about the strange attitude and singular flight of her father
marius had momentarily forgotten all this in the evening he did not even know that there had been a morning what he had done where he had breakfasted nor who had spoken to him he had songs in his ears which rendered him dead to every other though the only existed at the hours when he saw cosette
then as he was in heaven it was quite natural that he x mould forget earth
both bore languidly the indefinable burden of immaterial pleasures
this lived these donna m. bullets who are called lovers
alas
who is there who has not felt all these things
why does the revoke an hour when one emerged from this azure and why does life go on afterwards
loving almost takes the place of thinking
love is an ardent forgetfulness of all the rest
the back logic of passion if you will
there is no more absolute logical sequence in the human heart than there is a perfect geometrical figure in the celestial mechanism
for cosette and marius nothing existed except marius and cosette
the universe around them had fallen into a hole
they lived in a golden minute
there was nothing before them nothing behind
it hardly occurred to markus that cosette had a father
his brain was dazzled and obliterated
of what did these lover shall then
we have seen of the flowers and the swallows the setting sun and the rising moon and all sorts of important things
they had told each other everything except everything
the everything of lovers is nothing
but the father the realities that laid the ruffians that adventure to what purpose
and waste very sure that this nightmare had actually existed
they were two and they adored each other and beyond that there was nothing
nothing else existed
it is probable that this vanishing of hell in our fear is inherent to the arrival of paradise
have we beheld demons
are there any
have we trembled
have we suffered
we no longer know
dros y cloud hangs over it
so these two beings lived in this manner high sport with all that improbability which is in nature neither at the nadir not at the zenith between man and seraphim above the more below the ether in the clouds hardly flesh and blood soul and ecstasy from head to do it already too sublime to walk the earth still too heavily charged with humanity to disappear in the blue suspended like atoms which are waiting to be precipitated apparently beyond the bounds of destiny ignorant of that guy yesterday today tomorrow amazed rapturous floating soaring at times so light that they could take their flight out into the infinite almost prepared to soar a way to all eternity
they slept wide awake this sweetly lulled
in
splendid lethargy of the real overwhelmed by the ideal
sometimes beautiful as cosette was marius shut his eyes in her presence
the best way to look at the soul is through closed eyes
marius and cosette never asked themselves whither this was to lead them
they considered that they had already arrived
it is a strange claim on man's part to wish that love should lead to something
chapter iii the beginning of shadow jean valjean suspected nothing
cosette who was fatherless dreamy than marius was gay and that sufficed for jean valjean's happiness
the thoughts which cuvette cherished her tender preoccupations marius' image which filled her heart took away nothing from the incomparable purity of her beautiful chaste and smiling brow
she was at the age when the virgin bears her love as the angel his lily
so jean valjean was a tease
and then when two lovers have come to an understanding things always go well the third party who might disturb their love is kept in a state of perfect blindness by a restricted number of precautions which are always the same in the case of all lovers
this cosette never objected to any of jean valjean's proposals
did she want to take a walk
yes dear little father
did she want to stay at home
very good
did he wish to pass the evening with cosette
she was delighted
as he always went to bed at teno'clock marius did not come to the garden on such occasions until after that your when from the street he heard cosette open the long glass door on the veranda
of course no one ever met marius in the daytime
jean valjean never even dreamed any longer that marius was in existence
only once one morning he chanced to say to cosette why you have whitewash on your back
on the previous evening marius in a transport had pushed cosette against the wall
old toussaint who retired early thought of nothing but her sleep and was as ignorant of the whole matter as jean valjean
marius never set foot in the house
when he was with cosette they hid themselves in a recess near the steps in order that they might neither be seen nor heard from the street and there they say frequently content ing themselves by way of conversation with pressing each other's hands twenty times a minute as they gazed at the branches of the trees
at such times a thunderbolt might have fallen thirty paces from them and they would not have noticed it so deeply was the revert of the one absorbed and sunk in the revert of the other
limpid purity
hours wholly white almost all alike
this sort of love is a recollection of lily petals and the plumage of the dove
the whole extent of the garden lay between them and the street
every time that marius entered and let the carefully adjusted the bar of the gate in such a manner that no displacement was visible
he usually went away about midnight and returned to source urac's lodgings
source trac said to bw hotel would you believe it
marius comes home nowadays at oneo'clock in the morning
bw hotel replied what do you expect
there's always a pet are in a seminary fellow
at times source trac folded his arms assumed a serious air and said to marius you are getting irregular in your habits young man
source trac being a practical man did not take in good part this reflection of an invisible paradise upon marius he was not much in the habit of concealed passions it made him impatient and now and then he called upon marius to come back to reality
one morning he threw him this admonition my dear fellow you produce upon me the effect of being located in the moon the realm of dreams the province of illusions capital soap bubble
come be a good boy what's her name
but nothing could induce marius to talk
they might have torn out his nails before one of the two sacred syllables of which that ineffable name cosette was composed
true love is as luminous as the dawn and as silent as the tomb
only cour de grace as this change in marius that his taciturn ity was of the beaming order
during this sweet month of may marius and cosette learned to know these immense delights
no dispute and to say you for thou simply that they might say thou the better afterwards
to talk at great length with very minute details of persons in whom they took not the slightest interest in the world another proof that in that ravishing opera called love the libretto counts for almost nothing
for marius to listen to cosette discussing finery
for cosette to listen to marius talk in politics to listen knee pressed to knee to the carriages rolling along the rue de babylone to gaze upon the same planet in space or at the same glow worm gleaming in the grass to hold their peace together a still greater delight than conversation etc.
etc.
in the meantime divers com plications were approaching
one evening marius was on his way to the rendezvous by way of the boulevard des invalides
he habitually walked with dropping head
as he was on the point of turning the corner of the rue plume the heard someone quite close to him say good evening monsieur marius
he raised his head and recognized too none
this produced a singular effect upon him
he had not thought of that girl a single time since the day when she had conducted him to the rue plume the had not seen her again and she had gone completely out of his mind
he had no reasons for anything but gratitude towards her he owed her his happiness and yet it was embarrassing to him to meet her
it is an error to think that passion when it is pure and happy leads man to a state of perfection it simply leads him as we have noted to a state of oblivion
in this situation man forgets to be bad but he also forgets to be good
gratitude duty matters essential and important to be remember ec vanish
at any other time marius would have behaved quite differently to epo none
absorbed in cosette he had not even clearly put it to himself that this elini new ashamed ep onine the barrier and that's habits the name inscribed in his father's will that name for which buy a few months before he would have so ardently sacrificed himself
we show markus as he was
his father himself was fading out of his soul to some extent under the splendor of his love
he replied with some embarrassment at
so it's your login e
why do you call me you
have icons anything to you
home answered
certainly he had nothing against her
far from it
only he felt that he could not do otherwise now that he used thou to cosette than say you to epo none
as he remained silent she exclaimed say then she paused
it seemed as though words failed that creature formerly so needless and so bold
she tried to smile and could not
then she resumed well
then she paused again and remained with downcast eyes
good evening mr
marius said she suddenly and abruptly and a way she went
chapter iv as a brunson english and barks in slang the following day was the dog june aware which it is necessary to indicate on account of the grave events which at that epoch hung on the horizon of paris in the state of lightning charged clouds
marius at nightfall was pursuing the same road as on the preceding evening with the same thoughts of delight in his heart when he caught sight of epo nine approaching through the trees of the boulevard
two days in succession this was too much
he turned hastily aside quitted the boulevard changed his course and went to the rue plumer through the rue monsieur
this caused epo nine to follow him to the rue plumer a thing which she had not yet done
up to that time she had contented herself with watching him on his passage along the boulevard without ever seeking to encounter him
it was only on the evening before that she had attempted to address him
so soon one followed him without his suspecting the fact
she saw him displace the bar and slip into the garden
she approached the railing felt of the cars one after the other and readily recognized the one which marius had moved
she murmured in a low voice and in gloomy accents none of that lisette
she seated herself on the underpinning of the railing close beside the far as though she were guarding it
it was precisely at the point where the sailing touched the neighboring well
there was a dim book therein which soon one was entirely concealed
she remained this for more than an hour without stirring and without breaching a prey to her thoughts
towards teno'clock in the evening one of the two or three persons who passed through the rue plumer an old belated bourgeois who was making haste to escape from this deserted spot of evil repute as he skirted the garden railings and reached the angle which it made with the wall heard a dull and threatening voice saying i'm no longer surprised that he comes here every evening
the passerby cast a glance around him saw no one dared not peer into the black niche and was greatly alarmed
here doubled his pace
this passerby had reason to make haste for a very few instant slater six men who were marching separately and at some distance from each other along the wall and who might have been taken for a gray patrol entered the rue plumer
the first to arrive at the garden railing halted and waited for the others a second later all six were reunited
these men began to talk in a low voice
this is the place said one of them
is there acad dog in the garden
asked another
idon't know
in any case i have fetched at all that we'll make him eat
have you some putty to break the page with
yes
the railing is old interpolated a fifth who had the voice of a ventriloquist
so much the better said the second who had spoken
itwon't screech under the saw and itwon't be hard to cut
the sixth who had not yet opened his lips now began to inspect the rate as soon one had done an hour earlier grasping each bar in succession and shaking them cautiously
thus he came to the bar which marius had loosened
as he was on the point of grasping this harsh and emerged abruptly from the darkness fell upon his arm he felt himself vigorously thrust aside by a push in the middle of his breast and a hoarse voice said to him but not loudly there's a dog
at the same moment he perceived a pale girl standing before him
the man underwent that shock which the unexpected always brings
he bristled up in hideous wise nothing is so formidable to be holds a ferocious beast's who are uneasy their terrified air evokes terror
here coiled and stammered what jade is this
your daughter
it was in fact ep on one who had addressed the barrier
at the apparition of room ind the other five that is to say clashes ous girls her babe thru jon and montparnasse had noiselessly drawn near without precipitation without uttering a word with the sinister slowness peculiar to these men of the night
some indescribable but hideous tools were visible in their hands
fuel emer held one of those pairs of curved pincers which prowlers call fan china
ah see here what are you about there
what do you want with us
are you crazy
exclaimed the barrier as loudly as one can exclaim and still speak low what have you come here to hinder our work for
epo nine burst out laughing and threw herself on his neck
i am here little father because i am here
isn'ta person allowed to sit on the stones nowadays
it's you who ought not to be here
what have you come here for since it's a biscuit
i told magnon so
there's nothing to be done here
but embrace me my good little father
it'sa long time since i've seen you
do you're out
the barrier tried to disentangle himself from soon one's arms and grumbled that's good
you've embraced me
yes i'm out
i'm not in
now get away with you
but soon one did not release her hold and redoubled her caresses
but how did you manage it little pa
you must have been very clever to get out of that
tell me about it
and my mother
where is mother
tell me about mamma
the hardier replied she's well
idon't know let me alone and geoff i tell you
idon't hosp the denial out deep in one like a spoiled child you send me off and it's four months since i saw you and i've hardly had time to kiss you
and she caught her father round the neck again
come now this is stupid
said banff
make haste
said the kemer the cops may pass
the ventriloquist's voice repeated his di which nous n' sommes pas le jour del' any hisisn't new year's data before epa panama n
to peck at pa and ma
epo nine turned to the five ruffians
why it's monsieur bruno n
good day monsieur babe t
good day monsieur clashes lux
don't you know me monsieur by fisher
how to edit montparnasse
yes they know you
ejaculated the barrier
but good day good evening sheer off
leave us alone
it's the hour for foxes not for chickens said montparnasse
you see the job we have on hand here added babe t
epo nine caught montparnasse's hand
take care said he you'll cut yourself i've a knife open
my little montparnasse responded soon in every gently you must have confidence in people
i am the daughter of my father perhaps
monsieur babe f monsieur fuel emer i'm the person who was charged to investigate this matter
it is remarkable that epo nine did not talk slang
that frightful tongue had become impossible to her since she had known marius
she pressed in her hand small font and feeble as that of a skeleton fuel emer's huge coarse fingers and continued you know well that i'm no fool
ordinarily i am believed
i have rendered you service on various occasions
well i have made inquiries you will expose yourselves to no purpose you see
i swear to you that there is nothing in this house
there are lone women said the kemer
not be persons have moved away
the candleshaven'ta byway
ejaculated babe t
and he pointed out to epo nine across the tops of the trees a light which was wandering about in the mansard roof of the pavilion
it was toussaint who had stayed up to spread out some linen to dry
epo nine made a final effort
well said she they're very poor folks and it's a novel where thereisn'ta sou
go to the devil
cried the hardier
when we've turned the house upside down and put the cellar at the top and the attic below we'll tell you what there is inside and whether it's francs or skus or half bad things
and he pushed her aside with the intention of entering
my good friend mr.
montparnasse said so on one i entreat you you are a good fellowdin't enter
take care you'll cut yourself replied montparnasse
the barrier resumed in his decided to be decamp my girl and leave men to their own affairs
epo nine released montparnasse's hand which she had grasped again and said so you mean to enter this house
rather
grinned the ventriloquist
then she see her back against the gate faced the six ruffians who were armed to the teeth and to whom the night lent the dosages of demons and said in a firm low voice sell idon't mean that you shall
they halted in amazement
the ventriloquist however finished his grin
she went on friends
listen well
this is not what you want
now i'm talking
in the first place if you enter this garden if you pay a hand on this gate i'll scream i'll beat on the door i'll rouse everybody i'll have the whole six of you seized i'll call the police
she'd do it too said the hardier in a low tone to bruno ganz the ventriloquist
she shook her head and added beginning with my father
the barrier stepped heater
not so close my goodman
said she
he retreated growling between his teeth why what's the matter with her
and he added bitch
she began to laugh in a terrible way as you like but you shall not enter here
i'm not the daughter of a dog since i'm the daughter of a wolf
there are six of you what matters that time
you are men
welli'ma woman
youdon''t frighten me
i tell you that you chan' t enter this house because itdoesn't suit me
if you approach i'll bark
i told you i'm the dog and idon'ts are a straw for you
to your way you bore me
go where you please butdon't come here i forbid it
you can use your knives
i'll use kicks it's all the same time come on
she advanced space nearer the ruffians she was terrible she burst out laughing la reine
i'm not afraid
i shall be hungry this summer and i shall be sold this winter
aren't they ridiculous these bunnies of men to think they can scare a girl
what
scare
oh yes much
because you have conical poppets of mistresses who hide under the bed when you put on a bit voice forsooth
iain'ta fraud or anything that is in' t
she fastened her intent gaze upon the nerdier and said not even if you father
then she continued as she cast her bloodshot spectre like eyes upon the ruffians in turn what do i care if i'm picked up tomorrow morning on the pavement of the rue plumer killed by the blows of my father's club or whether i'm found a year from now in the nets at saint cloud of the isle of scans in the midst of rotten old dog leaned down re dogs
she was forced to pause she was seized by a dry cough her breath came from her weak and narrow chest like the death rattle
she resumed i have only to cry out and people will come and then slap bang
there are six of you i represent the whole world
the barrier made a movement towards her
don't approach
she cried
he halted and said gently well no. idon't approach butdon't speak so loud
so you intend to hinder us in our work my daughter
but we must earn our living all the same
have you no longer any kind feeling for your father
you bother me said epo none
but we must live we must eat burst
so saying she seated herself on the underpinning of the fence and hummed mon brass i do so my arm so plump may am be blend site my leg well formed et le temps perdu
and time wasted
she had set her elbow on her knee and her chin in her hand and she swung her foot with an air of indifference
her tattered town permitted a view of her thin shoulder blades
the neighboring street lantern illuminated her profile and her attitude
nothing more resolute and more surprising could be seen
the six rascals speechless and gloomy at being held in check by a girl retreated beneath the shadow cast by the lantern and held counsel with furious and humiliated shrugs
in the meantime she stares at them with a stern but peaceful air
there's something the matter with her said babe t
a reason
issue in love with the dog
it'sa shame to miss this anyway
two women an old fellow who lodges in the backyard and curtains that ain't so bad at the windows
the old code must be a new
i think the job's a good one
we'll go in. then the rest of you exclaimed montparnasse
do the job
i'll stay here with the girl and if she fails us he flashed the knife which he held open in his hand in the light of the lantern
the hard lee said not a word and seemed ready for whatever the rest pleased
bruno nano was somewhat of an oracle and who had as the reader knows put up the job had not as yet spoken
he seemed thoughtful
he had the reputation of not sticking at anything and it was known that he had plundered a police lost simply out of bravado
besides this he made verses and songs which gave him great authority
baber interrogated him you say nothing bruno n
bruno n remained silent an instant longer then he shook his head in various ways and finally concluded to speak der herr this morning i came across two sparrows fighting this evening i jostled a woman who was quarrelling
all that's bad
let's quit
they went away
as they went montparnasse muttered nevermind
if they had wanted i'd have cut her throat
baber responded iwouldn't
idon't hit a lady
at the corner of the street they halted and exchanged the following enigmatic al dialogue in a low tone where shall we go to sleep tonight
under pant in paris
have you the key to the gate the barrier
parsi
ep on one who never took her eyes off of them saw them retreat by the road by which they had come
she rose and began to creep after them along the walls and the houses
she followed them this as far as the boulevard
there they parted and she saw these six men plunge into the gloom where they appeared to melt away
chapter v things of the night after the departure of the ruffians the rue plumer resumed its tranquil nocturnal aspect
that which had just taken place in this street would not have astonished a forest
the lofty trees the closes the heaths the branches rudely interlaced the tall grass exist in a sombre manner the savages warming there catches glimpses of sudden apparitions of the invisible that which is below man distinguishes through the mists that which is beyond man and the things of which we living beings are ignorant there meet face to face in the night
nature bristling and wild takes alarm at certain approaches in which she fancied that she feels the supernatural
the forces of the gloom know eachother and are strangely balanced by each other
teeth and class fear what they can not grasp
blood drinking bestiality voracious appetite's hunger in search of prey the armed instincts of nails and jaws which have for source and aim the belly glare and smell out in easily the impassive spectral forms straying beneath a shroud erect in its vague and shuddering robe and which seem to them to live with a dead and terrible life
these brutalities which are only matter entertain a confused fear of having to deal with the immense obscurity condensed into an unknown being
a black figure barring the way stops the wild beast short
that which emerges from the cemetery intimidated and did concerts that which emerges from the cave the ferocious dear the sinister wolves recoil when they encounter a ghoul
chapter vi marius becomes practical once more to the extent of giving cosette his address while this sort of a dog with a human face was mounting guard over the gate and while the six ruffians were yielding to a girl marius was by cosette's size
never had the sky been more studded with stars and more charming the trees more trembling the odor of the grass more penetrating never had the birds fallen asleep among the leaves with a sweeter noise never had all the harmonies of universal serenity responded more thorough it to the inward music of love never had marius been more captivated more happy more ecstatic
but he had found coast texas coast he had been weeping
her eyes were res
this was the first cloud in that wonderful dream
markus' first word had been what is the matter
and she had replied this
then she had seated herself on the bench near the steps and while he trembling it took his place beside her she had continued my father told me this morning to hold myself in readiness because he has business and we may go away from here
marius shivered from head to foot
when one is at the end of one's life to sit means to go away when one is at the beginning of it for p away means to die
for the last six weeks marius had little by little slowly by degrees taken possession of cosette each day
as we have already explained in the case of first love the soul is taken long before the body later on one takes the body long before the soul sometimes one does not take the soul at all the day bias and the prudhomme's add because there is none but the sarcasm is fortunately a blasphemy
so marius possessed cosette as spirits possess by the enveloped her with all his soul and seized her jealously with incredible conviction
he possessed her smile her breath her perfume the profound radiance of her blue eyes the sweetness of her skin when he touched her hand the charming mark which she had on her neck all her thoughts
therefore he possessed all cosette's dreams
he incessantly gazed at and he sometimes touched lightly with his breath the short locks on the nape of her neck and he declared to himself that there was not one of those short hairs which did not belong to him marius
he gazed upon and adored the things that she wore her i go to bring on her gloves her sleeves her shoes her cuffs as sacred objects of which he was the master
he dreamed that he was the lord of those pretty shell combs which she wore in her hair and he even said to himself in confused and suppressed stammering's of voluptuousness which did not make their way to the light that there was not a ribbon of her gown not a mesh in her stockings not a bold in her bodice which was not his
beside cosette he felt himself beside his own property his own thing his own despot and his slave
it seemed as though they had so intermingled their souls that it would have been impossible to tell them apart had they wished to take them back again
this is mine
to it is mine
i assure you that you are mistaken
this is my property
what you are taking as your own is myself
marius was something that made a part of cosette and cosette was some him my which made a part of marius
marius felt cosette within him
to have cosette to possess cosette this to him was not to be distinguished from breathing
it was in the midst of this faith of this intoxication of this virgin possession unprecedented and absolute of this sovereignty that these words we are going away fell suddenly at a blow and that the harsh voice of reality cried to him cosette is not yours
marius awoke
for six weeks marius had been living as we have said outside of life those words going away
caused him to reenter it harshly
he found not a word to say
cosette merely felt that his hand was very cold
she said to him in her turn what is the matter
he replied in soloway one that cosette hardly heard him i did not understand what you said
she began again this morning my father told me to settle all my little affairs and to hold myself in readiness that he would give me his linen to put in a trunk that he was obliged to go on a journey that we were to go away that it is necessary to have a large trunk for me and a small one for him and that all is to be ready in a week from now and that we might go to england
but this is outrageous
exclaimed marius
it is certain that at that moment no abuse of power no violence not one of the abominations of the worst tyrants no action of busiris of tiberius or of henry viii
could have equalled this in atrocity in the opinion of marius m
f sichel event taking his daughter off to england because he had business there
he demanded in a weak voice and when do you start
he did not say when
and when shall you return
he did not say when
marius rose and said coldly cosette shall you go
cosette turned toward him her beautiful eyes all filled with anguish and replied in a sort of bewilderment where
to england
shall you to
why do you say you to me
i ask you whether you will go
what do you expect me to do
she said clasping her hands
do you will go
if my father goes
so you will go
cosette took marius' hand and pressed it without replying
very well said marine then i will go elsewhere
cosette felt rather than understood the meaning of these words
she turned so pale that her face shone white through the gloom
she stammered what do you mean
marius looks rather then raised his eyes to heaven and answered nothing
when his eyes fell again he saw cosette smiling at him
the smile of a woman whom one loves possesses a dye inks radiance even at night
how silly we are
marius i have a notes
what is it
if we go away do you got ok
i will tell you where
come and join me wherever i am
marius was now a thoroughly roused man
he had fallen back into reality
he cried to cosette go away with you
are you mad
why i should have to have money and i have none
go to england
but i am in debt now jose idon't know how much more than ten louis to court eyes cons of my friends with whom you are not acquainted
i have an old hat which is not worth three francs i have a coat which lacks buttons in front my shirt is all ragged my elbows are torn my boots let in the water for the last six weeks i have not thought about it and i have not told you about it
you only see me at night and you give me your love if you were to see me in the daytime you would give measly
go to england
eh
i haven't enough to pay for a passport
he threw himself against a tree which was close at hand erect his brow pressed close to the bark feeling neither the wood which flayed his skin nor the fever which was throbbing in his temples and there he stood motionless on the point of falling like the statue of despair
he remained a long time this
one could remain for eternity in such abysses
at last he turned round
he heard behind him a faint stifled noise which was sweet get sad
it was cosette sobbing
she had been weeping for more than two hours beside marius as he hesitated
he came to her fell at her knees and slowly prostrating himself he took the top of her foot which peeped out from beneath her robe and kissed it
she let him have his way in silence
there are moments when a woman accepts like a sombre and designed to dress the religion of love
do not weep he said
she murmured not when i may be going away and you can not come
he went on do you love me
she replied sobbing by that word from paradise which is never more charming than amid fears i adore you
be continued in a tone which was an indescribable caress do not deep
tell me will you do this for me and cease to weep
do you love me
said she
he took her hand
cosette i have never given my word of honor to anyone because my word of honor terrifies me
i feel that my father is by my side
well i give you my most sacred word of honor that if you go away i shall die
in the tone with which he uttered these words there lay a melancholy so solemn and so tranquil that cosette trembled
she felt that chill which is produced by a true and gloomy thing as it passes by
the shock made her cease weeping
now listen said he do not expect me tomorrow
why
do not expect me until the day after tomorrow
oh
why
you will see
a day without seeing you
but that is impossible
let us sacrifice one day in order to gain our whole lives perhaps
and marius added in a low tone and in an aside he is a man who never changes his habits and he has never received anyone except in the evening
of what man are you speaking
asked cosette
i
i said nothing
what do you hope then
wait until the day after tomorrow
you wish it
yes cosette
she took his head in both her hands raising herself on tiptoe in order to be on a level with him and tried to read his hope in his eyes
marius resumed now that i think of it you ought to know my address something might happen one never knows i live with that friend named source trac rue de la ferrer is no
he searched in his pocket pulled out his penknife and with the blade he wrote on the plaster of the wall rue de la ferreri e
in the meantime cosette had begun to gaze into his eyes once more
tell me your thought marius you have some idea
tell it to me
oh
tell me so that i may pass a pleasant night
this is my idea that it is impossible that god should mean to part us
salt expect me the day after tomorrow
what shall i do until then
said cosette
you are outside you go and come
how happy men are
i shall remain entirely alone
oh
how sad i shall be
what is it that you are going to do tomorrow evening
tell me
i am going to try something
then i will pray to god and i will think of you here so that you may be successful
i will question you no further since you do not wish it
you are my master
i shall pass the evening tomorrow in singing that music from eu ryan the that you love and that you came one evening to listen to outside my shutters
buy day after tomorrow you will come early
i shall expect you at dusk at nineo'clock precisely i warn you
mon dieu
how sad it is that the days are so long
on the stroke of nine do you understand i shall be in the garden
and i also
and without having uttered it moved by the same thought impelled by those electric currents which place lovers in continual communication both being intoxicated with delight even in the of sorrow they fell into each other's arms without perceiving that their lips met while their uplifted eyes overflowing with rapture and full of tears gazed upon the stars
when marius went forth the street was deserted
this was the moment when ep on one was following the ruffians to the book ever d
while marius had been dreaming with his head pressed to the tree an idea had crossed his mind an idea alas
that he himself judged to be senseless and impossible
he had come to a desperate decision
chapter vii the old heart and the young heart in the presence of each other at that epoch father ville norm and was well past his ninety first birthday
he still lived with mademoiselle ville normandin the rue des filles di val val reno
in the old house which he owned
he was as the reader will remember one of those antique old man who await death perfectly erect who have beats down without bending and whom even so grow can not curve
still his daughter had been saying for some time my father is sinking
he no longer fixed the maids' ears be no longer thumped the landing place so vigorously with his cane when basque was slow in opening the door
the revolution of july had exasperated him for the space of barely six months
he had viewed almost tranquilly that coupling of words in the moniteur m
humbolt cont speed of france
the fact is that the old man was deeply rejected
he did not tend he did not yield this was no more a characteristic of his physical than of his moral nature but he felt himself giving way internally
for four years he had been waiting for marius with his foot firmly planted that is the exact word in the conviction that that good for nothing young's camp would ring at his door some day or other now he had reached the point where at certain gloomy hours he said to himself that if marius made him wait much longer it was not death that was in support able to him it was the idea that perhaps he should never seems to us again
the idea of never seeing marius again had never entered his brain until that day now the thought began to recur to him and it chilled him
absence as is always the case in genuine and natural sentiments had only served to augment the grandfather's love for the ungrateful child who had gone off like a flash
it is during december nights when the cold stands at ten degrees that one thinks often set of the son
m
ville norm and was of thought himself above all things incapable of taking a single step me the grandfather towards his grandson i would die rather he said to himself
he did not consider himself as the least to blame but he thought of marius only with profound tenderness and the mute despair of an elderly kindly old man who is about to vanish in the dark
he began to lose his teeth which added to his sadness
m
ville norm and without however acknowledging it to himself for it would have rendered him furious and ashamed has never loved a mistress as he loved marius
he had had placed in his chamber opposite the head of his bed so that it should be the first thing on which his eyes fell on waking an old portrait of his other daughter who was dead madame pont mercy a portrait which had been taken when she was eighteen
he gazed incessantly at that portrait
one day he happened to say as he gazed upon it i think the likeness is strong
to my sister
inquired mademoiselle ville normand
yes certainly
the old man added and to him also
once as he sat with his knees pressed together and his eyes almost closed in a respondent attitude his daughter ventured to say to him father are you as angry with him as ever
she paused not daring to proceed further
with whom
he demanded
with that poor marius
he raised his aged head laid his withered and emaciated fist on the table and exclaimed in his most irritated and vibrating done poor marius do you say
that gentleman is a knave a wretched scoundrel again little ingrate a heartless soulless haughty and wicked man
and he turned away so that his daughter might not see the year that stood in his eye
three days later he broke a silence which had lasted four hours to say to his daughter point blank i had the honor to ask mademoiselle hills norman r. never to mention him to me
aunt ville norman e. renounced every effort and pronounced this acute diagnosis my father never cared very much for my sister after her folly
it is clear that he detects marius
after her folly meant after she had married the colonel
however as the reader has been able to conjecture mademoiselle ville norm and had failed in her attempt to substitute her favorite the officer of lancers for marius
the substitute the ovule had not been a success
m
gillen irm and had not accepted the quid pro quo
a vacancy in the heart does not accommodate itself to a stopgap
theo rule on his side though he scented the inheritance was disgusted at the task of pleasing
the goodman bored the lancer and the lancer shocked the goodman
lieutenant the ovule was gay no doubt but a chatterbox frivolous but vulgar a high liver but a frequent erie bad company he had mistresses it is true and he had a great deal to say about them it is true also but he talked badly
all his good qualities had a defect
m
ville norm and was workout with hearing him tell about the love affairs that he had in the vicinity of the barracks in the rue de babylone
and then lieutenant gillen or hand sometimes came in his uniform with the tricolored co. clare
this rendered him down right intolerable
finally father ville norm and had said to his daughter i've had enough of that the ovule
i haven't much taste for warriors in time of peace
receive him if you choose
idon't know but i prefer slashers to fellows that drag their swords
the clash of biases in battle is less dismal after all than the flank of the scabbard on the pavement
and then throwing out your chest like a built and lacing yourself like a girl with stays under your cuirass is doubly ridiculous
when one is a veritable man one holds equally aloof from swagger and from affected aids
he is neither a blister senora fit nicky hearted man
keep your theo rule for yourself
it was in vain that his daughter said to him but he is your brand nephew nevertheless it turned out that m
ville norm and who was a grandfather to the very fingertips was not in the least age and uncle
in fact as he had good sense and as he had compared the two the ovule had only served to make him regret marius all the more
one evening it was the th of june which did not prevent father ville norm and having a housing fire on the hearth he had dismissed his daughter who was seeing in a neighboring apartment
he was alone in his chamber amid it's pastoral scenes with his feet propped on the andirons half enveloped in his huge screen of coromandel lacquer with its nine leaves with his elbow resting on a table where burned two candles under a green shade engulfed in his tapestry armchair and in his hands book which he was not reading
he was dressed according to his wont like an inc. to table and resembled an antique portrait by rafat
this would have made people run after him in the street had not his daughter covered him up whenever he went out in a vast bishop's wadded cloak which concealed his attire
at home he never wore a dressing gown except when he rose and retired
it gives one a look of age said he
father ville norm and was thinking of marius lovingly and bitterly and as usual bitterness pdf dominate c
his tenderness once soured always ended by boiling and turning to indignation
he had reached the point where a man tries to make up his mind and to accept that which tends his heart
he was explaining to himself that there was no longer any reason why marius should return that if he intended to return he should have done it long ago that he must renounce the idea
he was trying to accustom himself to the thought that all was over and that he should die without having be held that gentleman again
but his whole nature revolted his aged paternity would not consent to this
well
said he this was his doleful refrain he will not return
his bald head had fallen upon his breast and he fixed a melancholy and irritated gaze upon the ashes on his hearth
in the very midst of his're very his old servant basque entered and inquired can monsieur receive m
marius
the old man sat up erect pallid and like a corpse which rises under the influence of a galvanic stock
all his blood had retreated to his heart
he stammered m
marius what
idon't know replied basque intimidated and put out of countenance by his master's work have not seen him
nicolette came in and said to me' there's a young man here day that it is m
marius
' father ville norma he stammered in a low voice show him in
and he remained in the same attitude with shaking head and his eyes fixed on the door
it opened once more
a young man entered
it was marius
marius halted at the door as though waiting to be bidden to enter
his almost squalid attire was not perceptible in the obscurity caused by the shade
nothing could be seen but his calm grave but strangely sad face
it was several minutes before father ville norm and dulled with amazement and you could see anything except a brightness as when one is in the presence of an apparition
he was on the point of swooning he was marius through a dazzling light
it certainly waste it certainly was marius
at last
after the lapse of four years
he grasped him entire so to speak in a single glance
he found him noble handsome distinguished well grown a complete man with a suitable mien and a charming air
he felt a desire to open his arms to call him to flung himself forward his heart melted with rapture affectionate words as filed and overflowed his breast at length all his tenderness came to the light and reached his lips and by a contract which constituted the very foundation of his nature what came forth was harshness
he said abruptly what have you come here for
marius replied with embarrassment monsieur m
guild norm and would have liked to have marius throw himself into his arms
he was displeased with marius and with himself
he was conscious that he was brusque and that marius was cold
it caused the goodman unendurable and irritating anxiety to feel so tender and forlorn within and only to be able to be hard outside
bitterness returned
he interrupted marius in a peevish tone then why did you come
that then dignified if you do not come to embrace me
marius looked at his grandfather whose pallor gave him a face of marble
monsieur have you come to get my pardon
do you acknowledge your faults
he thought he was putting marius on the right road and that the child would yield
marius shivered it was the denial of his father that was required of him he dropped his eyes and replied no sir
then exclaimed the old man impetuously with a brief that was poignant and full of wrath what do you want of me
markus clasped his hands advanced a step and said in a feeble and trembling voice sir have pity on me
these words touched n
ville norm and uttered a little sooner they would have rendered him tender but they came too late
the grandfather rose he supported himself with both hands on his cane his lips were white his brow wavered but his lofty form towered above marius as he bowed
pity on you sir
it is youth demanding pity of the old man of ninety one
you are entering into life i am leaving if you go to the play to balls to the safe to the billiard ball you have wig you please the women you are a handsome fellow as for me i spit on my brands in the heart of summer you are rich with the only riches that are really such i possess all the poverty of age infirmity isolation
you have your thirty two teeth a good digestion bright eyes strength appetite health gayety a forest of black hair i have no longer even white hair i have lost my teeth i am losing my legs i am losing my memory there are three names of streets that i confound incessantly the rue chariot the rue du chaume and the rue saint claude that is what i have come to you have before you the whole future full of sunshine and i am beginning to lose my sight so far am i advancing into the right you are in love that is a matter of course i am beloved by no one in all the world and you ask pity of me
par bleu
moliere forgot that
if that is the way you meet at the courthouse messieurs the lawyers i sincerely compliment you
you are drill
and the octogenarian went on in a grave and angry voice come now what do you want of me
sir said marius i know that my presence is displeasing to you but i have come merely to ask one thing if you and then i shall go away immediately
you are a fool
said the old man
who said that you were to go away
this was the translation of the tender words which lay at the bottom of his heart as img pardon
throw yourself on my neck
n
ville norm and felt that marius would leave him in a few moments that his harsh reception had repelled the law that his hardness was driving him away he said all this to himself and it augmented his grief and as his grief was straightway converted into wrath it increased his harshness
he would have liked to have marius understand and marius did not understand which made the goodman furious
he began again what
you deserted me your grandfather you left my house to go no one knows whither you drive your aunt to despair you went off it is easily guessed to lead a bachelor life it's more convenient to play the dandy to come in shall hours to amuse yourself you have given me no signs of life you have contracted debts without even telling me to pay them you have become as master of windows and a blister frame at the end of four years you come to me and that is all you have to say home
this violent fashion of driving a grandson toy sheerness was productive only of silence on the part of marius
k
ville norm and folded his arms a gesture which with him was peculiarly imperious and a post top mixed marius bitterly let us make an end of this
you have come to ask something of me you say
well what
what is it
speak
sir said marius with the look of a man who feels that he is falling over a precipice i have come to ask your permission to marty
m
ville norm and rang the bell
basque opened the door halfway
call my daughter
a second layer the door was opened once more made mlis file ville norm and did not enter but showed herself markus was standing mute with pendant arms and the face of a criminal m
ville norm and was pacing back and forth in the room
he turned to his daughter and said to her nothing
it is monsieur marius
san good day to him
monsieur wishes to marry
that's all
go away
the city hoarse sound of the old man's voice announced a strange degree of excitement
the aunt gazed at marius with a frightened air hardly appeared to recognize him did not allow a gesture of a syllable to escape her and disappeared at her father's breath more swiftly than a straw before the hurricane
in the meantime father ville norm and had returned and placed his back against the chimney piece once more
you marry

le duc de berry

canon r inquire without indiscretion
he paused and before marius had time to answer he added violently somehow you have a profession
a fortune made
how much do you earn at your trade of lawyer
nothing said marius with a sort of firmness and resolution that was almost fierce
nothing
then all that you have to live upon is the twelve hundred libres that i allow you
marius did not reply
m
ville norm and continued then i understand the girl is rich
as rich as i am

ejaculated the old gentleman

exclaimed marius
m
ville norm and interrupted him with the tone of a man who is speaking to himself that's right one and twenty years of age no profession twelve hundred livres a year madame la baronne delong mercy will go and purchase a couple of cons' worth of parsley from the fruit free
sir repeated marius in the despair at the last hope which was vanishing i entreat you
i conjure you in the name of heaven with clasped hands sir i throw myself at your feet permit me to marry her
the old man burst into a shout of strident and mournful laughter coughing and laughing at the same time
ah

i'll go hung up that old blockhead that absurd num skull
what a shame that i'm not twenty five
how i'd treat him to a nice respectful summons

it's nothing to me i'd say to him you're only too happy to see me to hold idiot i want to marry i desire to sex man sells no matter whom daughter of monsieur no matter what i have no shoes she has no chemise that just suits i want to throw my career my future my youth my life to the dogs i wish to take a plunge into wretchedness with a woman around my neck that's an idea and you must consent to it
and the old fossil will consent
' go'm glad do as you like attach your paving stone harry your pots se le vent your coupe le vent never worn ever
father never
at the tone in which that never was uttered marius lost all hope
he traversed the chamber with slow steps with bowed head tottering and more like a dying man than like one merely making his departure
m
ville norm and followed him with his eyes and at the moment when the door opened and marius was on the point of going out he advanced four paces with the senior vivacity of impetuous and spoiled old gentlemen seized marius by the collar brought him back energetically into the room flung him into an armchair and said to him tell me all about it
it was that single word father which had effected this revolution
magi he stared at him in bewilderment
m
ville norm and's mobile case was no longer expressive of anything but rough and ineffable good nature
the grand sire had given way before the grandfather
come see here speak tell me about your love affairs jabber tell me everything
capriati
how stupid young folks are
father repeated marius
the old man's entire countenance lighted up with indescribable radiance
yes that's right call me father and you'll see
there was now something so kind so gentle slope n hearted and so paternal in this brusque news that marius in the sudden transition from discouragement to hope was stunned and intoxicated by it as it were
he was seated near the table the light from the candles brought out the dilapidation of his costume which father hills norm and regarded with amazement
well father said markus
ah by the way interrupted m
ville norm and you really have not a penny then
you are dressed like a pickpocket
he rummaged in a drawer drew forth a purse which he laid on the table here are a hundred louis buy yourself what
father pursued marius my good father if you only knew
i love her
you can not imagine if the first time i saw her was at the luxembourg she came there in the beginning i did not pay much need to her and then idon't know how it came about i fell in love with her
oh
how unhappy that made me
now at last i see her everyday at her own home her father does not know it just fancy they are going away it is in the garden that we meet in the evening her father means to take her to england then i said to myself' i'll go and see my grandfather and tell him all about the affair
i should go mad first i should die i should fall ill i should throw myself into the water
i absolutely must marry her since i should go mad otherwise
' this is the whole truth and i do not think that i have omitted anything
she lives on a garden with an iron fence in the rue plumer
it is in the neighborhood of the invalides
rather ville norm and had seated himself with a beaming countenance beside marius
as he listened to him and drank in the sound of his voice he enjoyed at the same time a protracted pinch of snuff
at the words the plume the interrupted his inhalation and allowed the remainder of his snuff to fall upon his knees
the rue plumer the rue plumer did you say
let us see
are there not barracks in that vicinity
why yes that's it
your cousin the ovule has spoken to me about it
the lancer the officer
a gay girl my good friends gay girl
par did it esther us plumer
it is what used to be called the rue boomer
it all comes back to me now
i have heard of that little girl of the iron railing in the the plumer
in a gardens pamela
your taste is not bad
she is said to be a very tidy creature
between ourselves i think that simpleton of a lancer has been court in the rabit
idon't know where he did it
however that's not to the purpose
besides he is not to be believed
he grabs marius
i think it quite property at a young man like you should be in love
it's the right thing at your age
i like you better as a lover than as a jacobin
i like you better in love with a petticoat capriati
with twenty petticoats than with m
we robespierre
for my part i will do myself the justice to say that in the line of sans culottes i have never loved anyone but women
pretty girls are pretty girls the deuce
there's no objection to that
as for the little ones he receives you without her father's knowledge
that's in the established order of things
i have had adventures of that same sort myself
more than one
do you know what is done then
one does not take the matter ferociously one does not precipitate himself into the tragic one does not make one's mind to marriage and m
lemaire with his scarf
one simply behaves like a fellow of spirit
one shows good sense
skip along mortalsdon't marry
you come and look up your grandfather who is a good natured fellow at bottom and who always has a few tools of louis in an old drawer you say to him' see here grandfather
' and the grandfather days' that's a simple matter
youth must amuse itself and old age must wear out
i have been young you will be old

here are two hundred post olds
amuse yourself deuce take it
' nothing better
that's the way the affair should be treated
youdon''t marry but that does not afm
you understand me
marius petrified and incapable of uttering a syllable made a sign with his head that he did not
the old man burst out laughing winked visa red eye gave him a slap on the knee stated him fill in the face with a mysterious and beaming air and said to him with the tender way of shrugs of the shoulder booby
make her your mistress
marius turned pale
he had understood nothing of what his grandfather had just said
this twaddle about the rue biomet pamela the barracks the lancer had passed before marius like a dissolving view
nothing of all that could bear any reference to cosette who was a lily
the good man was wandering in his mind
but this wandering terminated in words which marius did understand and which were a mortal insult to cosette
those words make her your mistress entered the heart of the strict young man like a sword
he rose picked up his hat which lay on the floor and walked to the door with a firm assured step
there he turned round board deeply to his grandfather raised his head erect again and said five years ago you insulted my father today you have insulted my wife
i ask nothing more of you sir
farewell
father ville norm and utterly confounded opened his mouth extended his arms tried to rise and before he could utter a word the door closed once more and marius had disappeared
the old man remained for several minutes motionless and as though struck by lightning without the power to speak or breathe as though a clenched fist grasped his throat
at last before himself from his arm chair ran so far as a man can run at ninety one to the door opened it and cried help
help
his daughter made her appearance then the domestics
he began again with a pitiful rattle run after him
bring him back
what have i done to him
he is mar
he is going away
ah
my god
an
my god
this time he will not come back
he went to the window which looked out on the street threw it open with his aged and palsied hands leaned out more than half way while basque and nicolette held him behind and shouted markus
marius
marius
marius
but marius could no longer hear him for at that moment he was turning the corner of the rue saint louis
the octogenarian raised his hands to his temples two or three times with an expression of anguished could d tottering and fell back into an armchair pulse less voiceless fearless with quivering head and lips which moves with a stupid air with nothing in his eyes and nothing any longer in his heart except a gloomy and profound something which resembled night
book ninth
whither are they going
chapter i jean valjean that same way towards fouro'clock in the afternoon jean valjean was sitting alone on the backside of one of the most solitary slopes in the champ de mars
either from prudence or from a desire to meditate or simply in consequence of one of those insensible changes of habit which gradually introduce themselves into the existence of everyone he now rarely went out with cosette
he had on his workman's waistcoat and trousers of gray linen and his long visited cap concealed his countenance
he was calm and happy now beside cosette that which had for a time alarmed and troubled him had been dissipated but for the last week or two anxieties of another nature had come up
one day while walking on the boulevard he had caught sight of them are met thanks to his disguise the barrier had not recognized him but since that way jean valjean had seen him repeatedly and he was now certain that the barrier was prowling about in their neighborhood
this has been sufficient to make him come to a decision
moreover paris was not tranquil political troubles presented this in convenient feature for anyone who had anything to conceal in his life that the police had grown very uneasy and very suspicious and that while seeking to ferret out a man like pepin or more y they might very readily discover a man like jean valjean
jean valjean had made up his mind to quit paris and even france and go over to england
he had warned cosette
he wished to set out before the end of the week
he had seated himself on the slope in the champ de mars turning over all sorts of thoughts in his mind the barrier the police the journey and the difficulty of procuring a passport
he was troubled from all these points of view
last of all an inexplicable circumstance which had just attracted his attention and from which he had not yet recovered had added to his state of alarm
on the morning of that very day when he alone of the household was stirring while strolling in the garden before cosette's shutters were open he had suddenly perceived on the wall the following line engraved probably with a nail rue de la ferreri e
this was perfectly fresh the grooves in the ancient black mortar were write a tuft of nettles at the foot of the wall was powdered with the fine fresh plaster
this had probably been written on the preceding night
what was this
a signal for others
a warning for himself
in any case it was evident that the garden had been violated and that strangers had made their way into it
he recalled the odd incidents which had already alarmed the household
his mind was now filling in this canvas
he took goods are not to speak to cosette of the line written on the wall for fear of alarming her
in the midst of his preoccupation she perceived from a shadow cast by the sun that someone had halted on the crest of the slope immediately behind him
he was on the point of turning round when a paper folder in four fell upon his knees as though a hand had dropped it over his head
he took the paper unfolded it and read these words written in large characters with a pencil move away from your house
jean valjean sprang hastily to his feet there was no one on the slope he gazed all around him and perceived a creature larger than a child not so large as a man clad in a gray blouse and trousers of dust colored cotton velvet who was jumping over the parapet and who slipped into the most of the champ de mars
jean valjean returned home at once in a very thoughtful mood
chapter ii marius marius had left m
ville normandin despair
he had entered the house with very little hope and quitted it with immense despair
however and those who have observed the depths of the human heart will understand this the officer the lancer then in my cousin the ovule had left no trace in his mind
not the slightest
the dramatic post might apparently expect some complications from this revelation made point blank by the grandfather to the grandson
but what the drama would gain thereby truth would lose
marius was at an age when one believes nothing in the line of evil later on comes the age when one believes everything
suspicions are nothing else than wrinkles
early youth has none of them
that which overwhelmed othello glides innocuous over candide
suspect cosette
there are hosts of crimes which marius could sooner have committed
he began to wander about the streets there source of those who suffer
he thought of nothing so far as he could afterwards remember
at twoo'clock in the morning he returned to source urac's quarters and flung himself without undressing on his mattress
the sun was shining brightly when he sank into that frightful leaden slumber which permits ideas to go and come in the brain
when he awoke he saw source grace null taste hilly and combed errr standing in the room with their hats on and all ready to go out
source trac said to him are you coming to general la marque's funeral
it seemed to him that source trac was speaking chinese
he went out sometime after them
he put in his pocket the pistols which is very had given him at the time of the adventure on the dog february and which had remained in his hands
these pistols were still loaded
it would be difficult to say what vague thought he had in his mind when he took them with him
all day long he prowled about without knowing where he was going i trained at times he did not perceive it for his dinner he purchased a penny roll at a baker's put it in his pocket and forgot it
it appears that he took a bath in the seine without being aware of it
there are moments when a man has a furnace within his skull
marius was passing through one of those moments
he no longer hoped for anything this step he had taken since the preceding evening
he waited for night with feverish impatience he had but one idea clearly before his mind this was that at nineo'clock he should see cosette
this last happiness now constituted his whole future after that gloom
at intervals as he roamed through the most deserted boulevards it seemed to him that he heard strange noises in paris
he thrust his head out of his revert and said is there fighting on hand
at nightfall at nineo'clock precisely as he had promised cosette he was in the r kelly net
when he approached the grating he forgot everything
it was forty eight hours since he had seen cosette he was about to be told her once more every other thought was effaced and he felt only a profound and unheard of joy
those minutes in which one lives centuries always have this sovereign and wonderful property that at the moment when they are passing they fill the heart completely
marius displaced the bar and rushed headlong into the garden
cosette was not at the spot where she ordinarily waited for him
he traversed the thicker and approached the recess near the flight of steps she is waiting for me there said he
cosette was not there
he raised his eyes and saw that the shutters of the house were closed
he made the tour of the garden the garden was deserted
then he returned to the house and rendered senseless by love intoxicated terrified exasperated with grief and uneasiness like a master who returns home at an evil hour he tapped on the shutters
he knocked and knocked against the risk of seeing the window open and her father's gloomy face make its appearance and demand what do you want
this was nothing in comparison with what he dimly caught a glimpse of
when he had rapped he lifted up his voice and called cosette
cosette
nestled cosette
he repeated imperiously
there was no reply
all was over
no one of the garden no one in the house
marius fixed his despairing eyes on that dismal house which was as black and as silent as a tomb and far more empty
he gazed at the stones day on which he had passed so many adorable hours with cosette
then he seated himself on the flight of steps his heart filled with sweetness and resolution he blessed his love in the depths of his thought and he said to himself that douce cosette was gone all that there was left for him was to die
all at once he heard a voice which seemed to proceed from the street and which was calling to him through the trees mg
marius
he started to his feet
hey
said he
mr
marius are you there
yes
mr
marius went on the voice your friends are waiting for you at the barricade of the rue de la chambre rie
this voice was not wholly unfamiliar to him
it resembled the board trough voice of epo none
marius hastened to the gate thrust aside the movable bar passed his head through the aperture and saw someone who appeared to him to be a young man disappearing at a run into the gloom

lab rue jean valjean's purse was of house tom

m
have it in his venerable infantile austerity had not accepted the gift of the stars he had not admitted that a star could do in itself into louisd' or
he had not divined that what had fallen from heaven had come from nav to the
he had taken the purse to the police commissioner of the quarter as a post article placed by the finder at the disposal of claimants
the purse was actually lost
it is unnecessary to say that no one claimed it and that it did not succor m
man eur
moreover m
have it had continued his downward course
his experiments on indigo had been no more successful in the jardin des plantes than in his garden at austerlitz
the year before he had owed his housekeeper's wages now as we have seen he owed three quarters of his rent
the pawn shop had sold the plates of his flora after the expiration of thirteen months
some coppersmith had made steep and of them
his copper plates gone and being unable to complete even the incomplete copies of his flora which were in his possession he had disposed of the text at a miserable price as waste paper to a second hand bookseller
nothing now remained to him of his life's work
he set to work to eat up the money for these copies
when he saw that this wretched resource was becoming exhausted he gave up his garden and allowed it to run to waste
before this a long time before he had given up his two eggs and the morsel of beef which heard from time to time
he dined on bread and potatoes
he had sold the last of his furniture then all duplicates of his bedding his clothing and his blankets then his herbarium's and prints but he still retained his most precious books many of which were of the greatest rarity among others le squadrons historiques de la bible edition of la concordance des bibles by pierre de vessels's marguerite's de la marguerite of jean de la haye with a dedication to the queen of navarre the book de la charge etc ignite del' ambassadeur by the sieur de villiers hot mama florilegium rabbinic um of a to bully dog with this magnificent inscription veneto is in addi bus manuf janis and lastly a diogenes lxer to us printed at lyons in which contained the famous variant of the manuscript thirteenth century of the vatican and those of the two manuscripts of venice and consulted with such fruitful results by henri estienne and all the passages in doric dialect which are only found in the celebrated manuscript of the twelfth century belonging to the naples library
m
lab eur never had any fire in his chamber and went to bed at sundown in order not to consume any candles
it seemed as though he had no longer any neighbors people avoided him when he went out he perceived the fact
the wretchedness of a child interests another the wretched hess of a young man interests a young girl the wretchedness of an old man interests no one
it is of all distressed the coldest
still rather have it had not entirely lost his childlike serenity
his eyes acquired some vivacity when they rested on his books and he smiled when he gazed at the diogenes laertius which was a unique copy
his bookcase with glass doors was the only piece of furniture which he had kept beyond what was strictly indispensable
one day mother plug arques aid to him i have no money to buy any dinner
what she called dinner was a loaf of bread and four or five potatoes
on credit
suggested m
man eur
you know well that people refuse me
m
have it opened his book case took a long look at all his books one after another as a father obliged to decimate his children would gaze upon them before making a choice then seized one hastily put it in under his arm and went out
he returned two hours later without anything under his arm laid thirty sous on the table and said you will get something for dinner
from that moment forth mother plug are he saw a sombre cell which was never more lifted descend over the old man's candid face
on the following day on the day after and on the day after that it had to be done again
m
have it went out with a book and returned with a coin
as the secondhand dealers perceived that he was forced to sell they purchased of him for twenty sous that for which he had paid twenty france sometimes at those very shops
volume by volume the whole library went the same road
he said at times but i am eighty as though he cherished some secret hope that he should arrive at the end of his days before reaching the end of his books
his melancholy increased
once however he had a pleasure
he had gone out with a roberts etienne which he had sold for thirty five sous under the quai mala quaid and he returned with a half us which he had bought for forty sous in the rue des news
i owe five siu she said beaming on mother plug atque
that day he had no dinner
he belonged to the horticultural society
his destitution became known there
the president of the society came to see him promised to speak to the minister of agriculture and commerce about him and disco
why what
exclaimed the minister i should think so
an old savant
a botanist
a big offensive man
something must be done for him
on the following day n
have it received an invitation to dine with the minister
trembling with joy he showed the letter to mother plug atque
we are saved
said he
on the day appointed he went to the minister's house
he perceived that his ragged cravat his long square coat and his waxed shoes astonished the ushers
no one spoke to him not even the minister
about teno'clock in the evening while he was still waiting for a word he heard the minister's wife a beautiful woman in a low necked town whom he had not ventured to approach inquire who is that old gentleman
he returned home on foot at midnight in a driving rain storm
he had sold an else did to pay for a carriage in which to go thither
he had acquired the habit of reading a few pages in his diogenes larry luc every night before he went to bed
he knew enough greek to enjoy the peculiarities of the text which he owned
he had now no other enjoyment
several weeks passed
all at once mother plug atque fell ill
there is one thing sadder than having no money with which to buy bread at the baker's and that is having no money to purchase drugs at the spot be gary's
one evening the doctor had ordered a very expensive potion
and the malady was growing worse a nurse was required
m
have it opened his book case there was nothing there
the last volume had taken its departure
all that was left to him was diogenes late to us
he put this unique copy under his arm and went out
it was the thug june he went to the ports saint jacques to royal's successor and returned with one hundred francs
he laid the pile of five franc pieces on the old serving woman's night stand and returned to his chamber without saying a word
on the following morning at dawn he seated himself on the overturned post in his garden and he could be seen over the top of the hedge sitting the whole morning motionless with dropping heed his eyes vaguely fixed on the withered flower beds
i trained at intervals the old man did not seem to perceive the fact
in the afternoon extraordinary noises broke out in paris
they resembled shots and the clamor's of a multitude
rather have it raised his head
he saw a gardener passing and inquired what is it
the gardener space on back replied in the most unconcerned tone it is the riots
what riots
yes they are fighting
why are they fighting
ah good heavens
ejaculated the gardener
in what direction
went on m
mabry f
in the neighborhood of the arsenal
father gave it went to his room took his hat mechanically sought for a book to place under his arm found none said am
truly
and went off with a bewildered air
book tenth
the th of june chapter i. the surface of the question of what is revolt composed
if nothing and of every thing
of an electricity disengaged little by little of a flame suddenly darting forth of a wandering force of a passing breath
this breath encounters heads which speak brains which dream souls which suffer passions which burn wretchedness which howls and bears them away
a higher
at random
athwart the state the laws at heart prosperity and the insolence of others
irritated convictions embittered enthusiasms agitated indignation's instincts of war which have been repressed youthful courage which has been exalted generous blindness curiosity the taste for change the thirst for the unexpected the sentiment which causes one to take pleasure in reading the posters for the new play and love the promoter's whistle at the theatre the vague hatters rancor's disappointments every vanity which thinks that destiny has bankrupted it discomfort empty dreams ambitious that are hedged about whoever hopes for a downfall some outcome in short at the very bottom the rabble that mud which catches fire such are the elements of revolt
that which is grandest and that which is basest the brings who prowl outside of all bounds awaiting an occasion bohemians vagrants vagabonds of the crossroads those who sleep at night in a desert of houses with no other roof than the cold clouds of heaven those who each day demand their bread from chance and not from took the unknown of poverty and nothingness the bar earned the barefooted belong to revolt
whoever cherished in missoula secret revolt against any deed whatever on the part of the state of life or off age is ripe for riot and as soon as it makes its appearance he begins to quiver and to feel himself borne away with the whirlwind
revolt is a sort of water spout in the social atmosphere which forms suddenly in certain conditions of temperature and which as i teddies about mounts descends thunder's tears taxes crushes demolished up roots bearing with it great natures and small the strong man and the see how mind the tree trunk and the stalk of straw
woe to him whom it bears away as well as to him whom it strikes
it breaks the one against the other
it communicates to those whom it's sizes an indescribable and extraordinary power
it fills the first comer with the force of events it converts everything into projectiles
it makes a cannonball of a rough stone and a general of a porter
if we are to believe certain oracles of crafty political views a little revolt is desirable from the point of view of power
system revolt strengthens those governments which it does not overthrow
it puts the army to the test it consecrated the bourgeoisie it draws out the muscles of the police it demonstrates the force of the social framework
it is an exercise in gymnastics it is almost hygiene
power is in better health after a revolt as a man is after a good running down
revolt thirty years ago was regarded from still other points of view
there is for everything a theory which proclaims itself good sense phil int us against alcestis mediation offered between the false and the true explanation admonition rather naughty exten uation which because it is mingled with blame and excuse thinks itself wisdom and is often only pedantry
a whole political school called the golden mean has been the outcome of this
as between cold water and hot water it is the lukewarm water party
this school with its false depth all on the surface which dissects effects without going back to first causes chides from its height of a semi science the agitation of the public square
if we listen to this school the roots which complicates the affair of deprived that great event of a portion of its purity
the revolution of july had been a fine popular rape abruptly followed by blue sky
they made the cloudy sky reappear
they causes that revolution at first so remarkable for its unanimity to degenerate into a quarrel
in the revolution of july asin all progress accomplished by tits and starts there had been secret fractures these riots rendered them perceptible
it might have been said' ah
this is broken
' after the revolution of july one was sensible only of deliverance after the riots one was conscious of a catastrophe
all revolt closes the shops depresses the funds throws the exchange into consternation suspends commerce clogs business precipitate a failures no more money private fortunes rendered in each public credits taken industry disconcerted capital withdrawing work at a discount fear everywhere counter shocks in every town
hence gulfs
it has been calculated that the first day of a riot costs france twenty millions the second day forty the third sixty a three days' up rising costs one hundred and twenty millions that is to say if only the financial result be taken into consideration it is equivalent to a disaster a shipwreck of a list battle which should annihilate a fleet of sixty ships of the line
no doubt historically uprisings have their beauty the war of the pavements is no less grandiose and no less pathetic than the war of thickets in the one there is the soul of forests in the other the heart of cities the one has jean chohan the other has a jeanne
revolts have illuminated with a red glare all the most original points of the parisian character generosity devotions for my gayety students proving that bravery forms part of intelligence the national guard invincible bivouac's of shopkeepers fortresses of street urchin's contempt of death on the part of passersby
schools and legions clashed together
after all between the combatants there was only a difference of age the race is the same it is the same stoical men who died at the age of twenty for their ideas at forty for their families
the army always a sad thing in civil wars opposed prudence to audacity
uprisings while proving popular intrepidity also educated the courage of the bourgeois
this is well
but is all this worth the bloodshed
and to the bloodshed are the future darkness progress compromised uneasiness among the best men honest liberals in despair foreign absolutism happy in these wounds dealt to revolution by its own hand the vanquished of triumphing and saying' we told you so
' add paris enlarged possibly but francs most assuredly diminished
add for all must needs be told the massacres which have too often dishonored the victory of order grown ferocious over liberty gone mad
to sum up all uprisings have been disastrous
this speaks that approximation to wisdom with which the bourgeoisie that approximation to the people so willingly contents itself
for our parts we reject this word uprising was too large and consequently as too convenient
we make a distinction between one popular movement and another popular movement
we do not inquire whether an uprising costs as much as a battle
why a battle in the first place
here the question of war comes up
is war less of a scourge than an uprising is of a calamity
and then are all uprisings calamities
and what if the revolt of july did costa hundred and twenty millions
the establishment of philips
in spain cost france tel milliards
even at the same price we should prefer the th of july
however we reject these figures which appear to be reasons and which are only words
an uprising being given we examine it by itself
in all that is said by the doc trimark an objection above presented there is no question of anything but effect we seek the cause
we will be explicit
chapter ii the root of the matter there is such a thing as an uprising and there is such a thing as insurrection these are two separate phases of wrath one is in the wrong the other is in the right
in democratic states the only ones which are founded on justice it sometimes happens that the fraction usurps then the whole rises and the necessary claim of its rights may proceed as far as resort to arms
in all questions which result from collective sovereignty the war of the whole against the reaction is insurrection the attack of the fraction against the whole is revolt according as the tuileries contain a king of the convention they are justly or unjustly attacked
the same can not pointed against the populace is wrong on the th of august and right on the tho even demi wide
alike in appearance fundamentally different in reality the swiss defend the false bonaparte defends the true
that which universal suffrage has effected in its liberty and in its sovereignty can not be undone by the street
it is the same in things pertaining purely to civil oz ago on the instinct of the masses clear sighted today may be troubled tomorrow
the same fury legitimate when directed against her ray and absurd when directed against turgot
the destruction of machines the pillage of warehouses the breaking of rails the demolition of rocks the false routes of multitudes the refusal by the people of justice to progress rants assassinated by students rousseau driven out of switzerland and stones that is revolt
israel against moses athens against php clan rome against cicero that is an uprising paris against the bastille that is insurrection
the soldiers against alexander the sailors against christopher columbus this is the same revolt impious revolt why
because alexander is doing for asia with the sword that which christopher columbus is doing for america with the compass alexander like columbus is finding a world
these gifts of a world to civilization are such augmentations of light that all resistance in that case is culpable
sometimes the populace counterfeits fidelity to itself
the masses are traitors to the people
is there for example anything stranger than that long and bloody protest of dealers in contraband salts legitimate chronic revolt which at the decisive moment on the day of salvation at the very hour of popular victory espouses the throne turns into chou ann erie and from having been an insurrection against becomes any pricing for sombre masterpieces of ignorance
the contraband walt dealer escapes the royal robbers and with a good' send round his neck mounts the white cock are
death to the salt duties brings forth long live the king
the assassins of saint barthelemy the cutthroats of september the manslaughter eds of aging on the assassins of coligny the assassins of madam lamb alle the assassins of brune mique let's verde facade metres the companions of jehu the chevaliers of brassard behold an uprising
lavender is a grant catholic uprising
the sound of right on movement is recognizable it does not always proceed from the trembling of excited masses there are made ages there are cracked bells a lot of sins do not give out the sound of bronze
the brawl of passions and ignorance's is quite another thing from the shock of progress
show me in what direction you are going
rise if you will but let it be that you may grow great
there is no insurrection except in a forward direction
any other sort of rising is bad every violent step towards the dead is a revolt to retreat is to commit acres of violence against the human race
insurrection is a bit of rage on the part of truth the pavements which the uprising disturbs give forth the spark of right
these pavements bequeath to the uprising only their mud
canton against louis xiv
is insurrection hebert against canton is revolt
hence it results that in insurrection in given cases may be as lafayette says the most holy of duties an uprising may be the most fatal of crimes
there is also a difference in the intensity of heat insurrection is often a volcano revolt is often only a fire of straw
revolt as we have said is sometimes found among those in power
poll gnac is a filter camille des moulins is one of the governing powers
insurrection is sometimes resurrection
the solution of everything by universal suffrage being an absolutely modern fact and all history anterior to this fact being for the space of four thousand years filled with violate wright and the suffering of peoples each epoch of history brings with it that protest of which it is capable
under the caesars there was no insurrection but there was juvenal
the back find it batik replaces the gracchi
under the caesars there is the exile to sue me there is also the man of the annales
we do not speak of the immense exile of patmos who on his part also overwhelms the real world with a protest in the name of the ideal world who makes if his vision an enormous satire and casts on rome nineveh in rome babylon in rome sodom the flaming reflection of the apocalypse
john on his rock is the sphinx on its pedestal we may understand him he is a new and it is hebrew but the man who writes the annales is of the latin rate of the rather say he is a roman
as the hero's reign in a black way they should be painted to match
the work of the trading tool alone would be too pale there must be poured into the channel a concentrated prose which noted
despots count for something in the question of philosophers
a word that is chained is a terrible word
the writer doubles and trebles his style when silence is imposed on a nation by its master
from this silence there arises a certain mysterious plenitude which filters into thought and there contra la into bronze
the compression of history produces conciseness in the historian
the granite solidity of such and such a celebrated prose is nothing but the accumulation effected by the tyrant
tyranny constrains the writer to conditions of diameter which are augmentations of force
the cover on jan period which hardly sufficed for verdes would be blunted on caligula
the less spread of sail in the phrase the more intensity in the flow
tacitus thinks with all his might
the honesty of a great heart condensed injustice and truth overwhelms as with lightning
be it remarked in passing that tacitus is not historically superposed upon caesar
the tiberius are reserved for him
caesar and tacitus are two successive phenomena a meeting between whom seems to be mysteriously avoided by the one who when he sets the centuries on the stage regulates the entrances and the exits
caesar is great tacitus is great god spares these two great nesses by not allowing them to clash with one another
the guardian of justice in striking caesar might strike too hard and be unjust
god does not will it
the great wars of africa and spa in the pirates of sicily destroyed civilization introduced into gaulin to britanny into germany all this glory covers the rubicon
there is here a sort of delicacy of the divine justice hesitating to let loose upon the illustrious usurped the formidable historian sparing caesar tacitus and according extenuating circumstances to genius
certainly despotism remains despotism even under the despot of genius
there is corruption under all illustrious tyrants but the moral pest is still more hideous under infamous tyrants
in such reigns nothing veils the shame and those who make examples tacitus as well as juvenal slap this ignominy which can not reply in the face more usefully in the presence of all humanity
rome smells worse under vitellius than under sylla
under claudius and under domitian there is a deformity of baseness corresponding to the repulsive ness of the tyrant
the villainy of slaves is a direct product of these spots miasma exhales from these cowering consciences wherein the master is reflected public powers are unclean hearts are small consciences are full souls are like vermin thus it is under caracalla thus it is under commodus thus it is under hell of a value while from the roman senate under caesar there comes nothing but the odor of the dung which is peculiar to the eye use of the eagles
hence the advent apparently tardy of the tacit uses and the juvenal sig is in the hour for evidence that the demonstrator makes his appearance
but juvenal and tacitus like is austin biblical times like dante in the middle ages is man riot and insurrection are the multitude which is sometimes right and sometimes wrong
in the majority of cases riot proceeds from a material fact insurrection is always a moral phenomenon
riot is mas aniello insurrection spartacus
insurrection borders in mind riot on the stomach faster grows irritated but faster assuredly is not always in the wrong
in questions of famine riot bus and aid for example holds a true pathetic and just point of departure
nevertheless it remains a riot
why
it is because right at bottom it was wrong inform
why although in the right violent although strong it struck at random it walked like a blind elephant it left behind it the corpses of old men of women and of children it wished the blood of inoffensive and innocent persons without knowing why
the nourishment of the people is a good object to massacre them is a bad means
all armed protests even the most legitimate even that of the thug august even that of july th begin with the same troubles
before the right gets set free there is foam and tumult
in the beginning the insurrection is a riot just as a river is a torrent
ordinarily it ends in that ocean revolution
sometimes however coming from those lofty mountains which dominate the moral horizon justice wisdom reason right formed of the pure snow of the ideal after a long fall from rock to rock after having reflected the sky in its transparency and increased by a hundred affluent's in the majestic mien of triumph insurrection is suddenly lost in some quan nj read the rhine is in a swamp
all this is of the past the future is another thing
universal suffrage has this admirable property that it dissolves riot in its inception and by giving the vote to insurrection it deprives it of its arms
the disappearance of wars of streets are as well as of wars on the frontiers such is the inevitable progression
whatever today maybe tomorrow will be peace
however insurrection riot and points of difference between the former and the latter the bourgeois properly speaking knows nothing of such shares
in his mind allies edition rebellion pure and simple the revolt of the dog against his master an attempt to bite whom must be punished by the chain and the kennel barking snapping until such day as the head of the dog suddenly enlarged is outlined vaguely in the gloom face to face with the lion
then the bourgeois shouts long live the people
this explanation given what does the movement of june signify so far as history is concerned
is it a revolt
is it an insurrection
it may happen to us in placing this formidable event on the stage to say revolt now and then but merely to distinguish superficial facts and always preserving the distinction between reboot the form and insurrection the foundation
this movement it had in its rapid outbreak and on it's melancholy extinction so much grandeur that even those who seek not only an uprising never refer to it otherwise than with respect
for them it is like a relic of
excited imaginations say they are not to becalmed in a day
a revolution can not be cut off short
it must needs undergo some undulations before it returns to a state of rest like a mountain sinking into the plain
there are no alps without their juran or pyrenees without the asturias
this pathetic crisis of contemporary history which the memory of parisians calls the epoch of the riots is certainly a characteristic your amid the stormy hours of this century
a last word before we enter on the recital
the facts which we are about to relate belong to that dramatic and living reality which the historian sometimes neglects for lack of time and space
there nevertheless we insist upon it is life palpitation human tremor
petty details as we think we have already said are so to speak the foliage of great events and are lost in the distance of history
the epoch surnames of the riots abounds in details of this nature
judicial inquiries have not revealed and perhaps have not sounded the depths for another reason than history
we shall therefore bring to light among the known and published peculiarities things which have not heretofore been known about facts over which have passed the forgetfulness of some and the death of others
the majority of the actors in these gigantic scenes have disappeared beginning with the very next day they held their peace but if what we shall relate we shall be able to say we have seen this
we alter a few names for history relates and does not inform against but the deed which we shall paint will be genuine
in accordance with the conditions of the book which we are now writing we shall show only one side and one episode and certainly the least known at that of the two days they handy method june but we shall do it in such wide that the reader may catch a glimpse beneath the gloomy veil which we are about to lift of the real form of this frightful public adventure
chapter iii a burial an occasion to be born again in the spring of although the cholera had been chilling all kinds for the last three months and had fast over their agitation an indescribable and gloomy pacification paris had already long been ripe for commotion
as we have said the great city resembles a piece of artillery when it is loaded it suffices for a spark to fall and the shot is discharged
in june the spark was the death of general la marque
la marque was a man of renown and of action
he had had in succession under the empire and under the restoration the sorts of bravery requisite for the two epochs the bravery of the battlefield and the bravery of the tribune
he was as eloquent as he had been valiant a sword was discernible in his speech
like to this predecessor after upholding the command be upheld liberty he sat between the left and the extreme left beloved of the people because he accepted the chances of the future beloved of the populace because he had served the emperor well he was in company with con res gerard and drouet one of napoleon's marshals un perro
the treaties or removed him as a personal offence
negated wellington with asian fight hatred which pleased the multitude and for seventeen years he majestically preserved the sadness of waterloo paying hardly any attention to intervening events
in his death agony at his last hour he clasped to his breast as word which had been presented to him by the officers of the hundred days
napoleon had died uttering the word army la marque uttering the word country
his death which was expected was dreaded by the people as a loss and by the government as an occasion
this death was an affliction
like everything that is bitter affliction may turn to revolt
this is what took place
on the preceding evening and on the morning of the th of june the day appointed for la marque's burial the faubourg saint antoine which the procession was to touch at assumed a formidable aspect
this tumultuous network of streets was filled with rumors
they armed themselves as best they might
joiners carried off door weights of their establishment to break down doors
one of them had made himself a danger of a stocking weaver's book by breaking off the hook and sharpening the stump
another who was in a fever to attack slept wholly dressed for three days
a carpenter name room bier meta comrade who asked him whither are you going
eh
well i have no weapons
what then
i'm going to my timber yard to get my compasses
what for
idon't know said lobbied
a certain jacqueline an expeditious man accosted some passing artisans come here you
he treated them to get sous' worth of wine and said have you work
no
go to file pierre between the barriers sharon me and the barriers montreuil and you will find work
atrios pierre's they found cartridges and arms
certain well known leaders were going the rounds that is to say running from one house to another to collect their men
st barthelemy's near the barrier edit done at capel's near the petit chapeau the drinkers accosted each other with a grave air
they were heard today have you your pistol
under my blouse
and you
under my shirt
in the rue travers le're in front of the bland workshop and in the yard of the maison brulee in front of tool maker bernier's groups whispered together
among them was observed a certain jadot who never remained more than a week in one stop as the masters always discharged him because they were obliged to dispute with him every day
mac it was killed on the following day at the barricade of the theme nil montant
left or who was destined to perish also in the struggle seconded mavor and to the question what is your object
he replied insurrection
workmen assembled at the corner of the rue de mercy waited for a certain lemar in the revolutionary agent for the faubourg saint marceau
watch words were exchanged almost publicly
ont meth of june accordingly a day of mingled rain and sun general la marque's funeral procession traversed paris with official military pomp somewhat augmented through precaution
two battalions with draped drums and reversed arms ten thousand national guards with their swords at their sides escorted the coffin
the hearse was drawn by young men
the officers of the invalides came immediately behind it bearing laurel branches
then came an innumerable strange agitated multitude the section aries of the friends of the people the law school the medical school refugees of all nationalities and spanish italian german and polish flags tricolored horizontal banners every possible sort of banner children waving green boughs stonecutters and carpenters who were on strike at the moment printers who were recognizable by their paper caps marching two by two three by three uttering cries nearly all of them brandishing sticks some brandishing sabres without order and yet with a single soul now a tumultuous r out again a column
squads chose themselves leaders am an armed with a pair of pistols in full view seemed to pass the host in review and the files separated before him
on the side alleys of the boulevards in the branches of the trees on balconies in windows on the roofs swarmed the heads of men women and children all eyes were filled with anxiety
an armed throng was passing and a terrified throng looked on
the government on its side was taking observations
it observed with its name in its sword
four squadrons of carabiner rd could be seen in the place louis xv
in their saddles with their trumpets at their head cartridge boxes filled and muskets loaded all in readiness to march in the latin country and at the jardin des plantes the municipal guarded belonged from street to street at the maple aux fins a squadron of dragoon say they're behalf of the tj light infantry the other half being at the bastille the rh dragoons at the celestine and the courtyard of the louvre full of artillery
the remainder of the troops were confined to their barracks with our reckoning the regiments of the environs of paris
power being uneasy held suspended over the menacing multitude twenty four thousand soldiers in the city and thirty thousand in the banlieue
divers reports were in circulation in the cortege
let it umist tricks were hinted at they spoke of the duc de reich start whom god had marked out for death at that very moment when the populace were designating him for the empire
one person and whose name has remained unknown announced that at a given your two overseers who had been won over would throw open the doors of a factory of arms to the people
that which predominated in the uncovered brows of the majority of those present was enthusiasm mingled with rejection
here and there also in that multitude given over to such violent but noble emotions there were visible genuine dosages of criminals and ignoble mouths which said let us plunder
there are certain agitations which stir up the bottoms of marshes and make clouds of mud rise through the water
a phenomenon to which well drilled policemen are no strangers
the procession proceeded with feverish slowness from the house of the deceased by way of the boulevards as far as the bastille
it rained from time to time the rain mattered nothing to that throng
many incidents the coffin borne round the vendome column stones thrown at the duc de vita james who was seen on a balcony with his hat on his heart metallic cock torn from a popular flag and dragged in the mirra policeman wounded with a blow from a sword at the ports saint martin an officer of the thought infantry saying aloud i am a republican the polytechnic school coming up unexpectedly against orders to remain at home the shouts of long live the polytechnique
long live the republic
marked the passage of the funeral train
at the bastille long files of curious and formidable people who descended from the faubourg saint antoine effected a junction with the procession and a certain terrible seething began to agitate the throng
one man was heard today to another do you see that fellow with a red beard he's the one who will give the word when we are to fire
it appears that this red beard was present at another riot the quen is set affair entrusted with this same function
the hearse passed the bastille traverses the small bridge and reached the esplanade of the bridge of austerlitz
there it halted
the crowd surveyed at that moment with a bird's eye view would have presented the aspect of a comet whose head was on the esplanade and whose rail spread out over the quay bourdon covered the bastille and was prolonged on the boulevard as far as the ports saint martin
a circle was traced around the hearse
the vast rout held their peace
lafayette spoke and bade la marque farewell
this was a touching and august instant all years uncovered all hearts beat high
all at once a man on horseback clad in black made his appearance in the middle of the group with a red flag others say with spike surmounted with a red liberty cap
lafayette turned aside his head
edelman's quitted the procession
this red flag raised a storm and disappeared in the midst of it
from the boulevard bourdon to the bridge of austerlitz one of those clamor's which resemble follows stirred the multitude
two prodigious shouts went up la marque to the pantheon
lafayette to the town hall
some young men amid the reclamation's of the throng harnessed themselves and began to drag la marque in the hearse across the bridge of austerlitz and lafayette in a hackney coach along the quai morland
in the crowd which surrounded and cheered lafayette it was noticed that a german showed himself named ludwig snyder who died a cents marian afterwards who had also been in the war of and who had fought at trenton under washington and at brandywine under lafayette
in the meantime the municipal cavalry on the left bank had been set in motion and came to bar the bridge of the right bank the dragoons emerged from the celestine and deployed along the quai morland
the men who were dragging lafayette suddenly caught sight of them at the corner of the quay and shouted the dragoons
the dragoons advance data walk in silence with their pistols in their holsters their swords in their scabbards their guns slung in their leather sockets with an air of gloomy expectation
they tained two hundred paces from the little bridge
the carriage in which sat lafayette advanced to them their ranks opened and allowed it to pass and then closed behind it
at that moment the dragoons and the crowd touched
the women fled in terror
what took place during that fatal minute
no one can say
it is the dark moment when two clouds come together
some declare that a blast of trumpets sounding the charge was heard in the direction of the arsenal others that a blow from a danger was given by a child to a dragoon
the fact is that three shots were suddenly discharged the first killed cholet chief of the squadron the second killed an old dead woman who was in the act of closing her window the third signed the snl ulcer or an officer a woman screamed they are beginning too soon
and all at once a squadron of dragoons which had remained in the barracks up to this time was seen to dr. blush at a gallop with bated swords through the rue bascom pierre and the boulevard bourdon sweeping all before them
the ball is said the tempest is loosed stones rain down a fusillade breaks forth many precipitate themselves to the bottom of the bank and pass the small arm of these one now filled in the timber yards of the isle louviers that vast citadel ready to hand bristle with combatants stakes are torn up pistol shots fired a barricade begun the young men who are thrust back pass the austerlitz bridge with the years wat arun and the municipal guard the carabiner rs rush up the dragoons ply their swords the crowd dispersed in all directions a rumor of war flies to all four quarters of paris men's youth parks
they run tumble down five resist
wrath spreads a broad the rio has find spread satire
chapter iv the ebullition's of former days nothing is more extraordinary than the first breaking out of a riot
everything bursts forth everywhere at once
was it foreseen
yes
was it prepared
no
whence comes it
from the pavements
whence falls it
from the clouds
here insurrection assumes the character of a plot thereof an improvisation
the first comer's sizes a current of the throng and leads it whither he wills
a beginning full of terror in which is kindled a sort of formidable gayety
first come clamor's the shops are closed the displays of the merchants disappear then come isolated shots people fled blows from gun stocks beat against portes doc here's servants can be heard laughing in the courtyards of houses and saying there's going to be a row
a quarter of an hour had not elapsed when this is what was taking place at twenty different spots in paris at once
in the rue saint e croix de la breton merle twenty young men bearded and with long hair entered a dram shop and emerged a moment later carrying a horizontal tricolored flag covered with craps and having at their head three men armed one with a sword one with a gun and the third with spike
in the rue des no gain didrex a very well dressed bourgeois who had a prominent belly a sonorous voices bald head aloft throw a black bears and one of these stuff mustaches which will not lie flat offered cartridges publicly to passersby
in the rue saint pierre montmartre men with bare arms carried about a black flag on which could be read in white letters this inscription republic of death
in the rue des jeune its rue du cadran them on for the il rush and we groups appeared waving flags on which could be distinguished in gold letters the word section with a number
one of these flags wasted and blue with an almost imperceptible strike of white between
they pillaged a factory of small arms on the boulevard saint martin and three admirers's hope the first in the rue beaubourg the second in the rue michelle comte the other in the rue du temple
in a few minutes the thousand hands of the crowd had seized and carried off two hundred and thirty guns nearly all double barrelled sixty four swords and eighty three pistols
in order to provide more arms one man took the run the other the bayonet
opposite the quai de la greve young men armed with muskets installed themselves in the houses of some women for the purpose of firing
one of them had a flintlock
the grant entered and set about making cartridges
one of these women relates i did not know what cartridges were it was my husband who told me
one cluster broke into a curiosity shop in the rue des vielle shaker is the sand seized haha thats and turkish arms
the body of amazon who had been killed by a gunshot lay in the rue de la perle
and then on the right bank the left bank on the quays on the boulevards in the latin country in the quarter of the halles panting men artisans students members of sections read proclamations and shouted to arms
broke street lanterns in harnessed carriages unpaved the streets broke in the doors of houses uprooted trees rummaged sellars rolled out hogshead she sped up paving stones rough slabs furniture and planks and made barricades
they forced the bourgeois to assist them in this
they entered the dwellings of women they forced them to hand over the swords and guns of their absent husbands and they wrote on the door with whiting the arms have been delivered some signed their names to receipts for the guys and swords and said send for them tomorrow at the mayor's office
they disarmed isolated sentinels and national guardsmen in the streets on their way to the town hall
they tore the epaulets from officers
in the rue du simitis de saint nicholas an officer of the national guard on being pursued by a crowd armed with clubs and foils took refuge with difficulty in a house whence he was only able to emerge at nightfall and in disguise
in the quartier saint jacques the students swarmed out of their hotels and ascended the rue saint hyacinthe to the cafe du progress or descended to the cafe des sept. billards in the rue de smart urine
there in front of the door young men mounted on the stone corner posts distributed arms
they plundered the timber yard in the rue trans no gain in order to obtain material for barricades
on a single point the inhabitants resisted at the corner of the rue saint devote and the rue simon lefranc where they destroyed the barricade with their own hands
at a single point the insurgents yielded they abandoned a barricade begun in the rue de temple after having fired on a detachment of the national guard and flew through the rue de las order is
the detachment picked up in the barricades redcoats package of cartridges and three hundred pistol balls
the national guardsmen tore up the flag and carried off its tattered remains on the points of their bayonets
all that we are here relating slowly and successively took place simultaneously at all points of the city in the midst of a vast tumult like a mass of tongues of lightning in one clap of thunder
in less than an hour twenty seven barricades sprang out of the earth in the quarter of the halls saline
in the centre was that famous house no
which was the fortress of jeanne and her six hundred companions and which flanked on the one hand by a barricade at saint merry and on the other by a barricade of the tue may nude commanded three streets the rue des arc is the rue saint martin and the tue aug rule voucher which it faced
the barricades at right angles fell back the one of the rush into true upon the grande try and erie the other of the rue geoffroy langevin on the rue saint savoye
without reckoning in numer able barricades in twenty other quarters of paris in the marais at mont sainte genevieve one in the theme nil montant where was visible sports doc here torn from its hinges another near the little bridge of the hotel dieu made with a necks axis which had been in harnessed and overthrown three hundred paces from the prefecture of police
at the barricade of the rue des me he tried as well dressed man distributed money to the workmen
at the barricade of the due trenet at a horseman made his appearance and handed to the one who seemed to be the commander of the barricade what had the appearance of a roll of silver
here said he this is to pay expenses wine etc. after a
a light haired young man without a cravat went from barricade to barricade carrying passwords
another with a naked sword a blue police cap on his head placed sentinels
in the interior beyond the barricades the wine shops and porters' lodges were converted into guard houses
otherwise the riot was conducted after the most scientific military tactics
the narrow uneven sinuous streets full of angles and turns were admirably chosen the neighborhood of the halles in particular a network of streets more intricate than a forest
the society of the friends of the people had it was said undertaken to direct the insurrection in the quartier sainte a vote
a man killed in the rue du pont eau who was searched had on his persona plan of paris
that which had really undertaken the direction of the uprising was a sort of strange impetuosity which was in the air
the insurrection had abruptly built barricades with one hand and with the other seized nearly all the posts of the garrison
in less than three hours like a train of powder catching fire the insurgents had invaded and occupied of the right bank the arsenal the mayoralty of the place royale the whole of the marais the pop in court arms manufactory laval lots the chateaud' eau and all the streets near the talked on the left bank the barracks of the veterans sainte pflag is the place may meet the powder magazine of the deux moulins and all the barriers
at fiveo'clock in the evening they were masters of the bastille of the lingerie of the blanc's mantra is their scouts had reached the place des victoires and menaced the bank the petits peres barracks and the post office
a third of paris was in the hands of the rioters
the conflict had been begun on a gif antics sale at all points and as a result of the disarming domiciliary visits and admirers' shops hastily invaded was that the combat which had begun with the throwing of stones was continued with gunshots
about sixo'clock in the evening the passage due simon became the field of battle
the uprising was at one end the troops were at the other
they fired from one game to the other
an observer a dreamer the author of this book who had gone to get a near view of this volcano found himself in the passage between the two fires
all that he had to protect him from the bullets was the swell of the two half columns which separate the shop she remained in this delicate situation for nearly half an hour
meanwhile the call to arms was beaten the national guard armed in haste the legions emerged from the mayoral ities the regiments from their ba tracks
opposite the passage del' andrea drummer received a blow from a dagger
another in the rue du cygne was assailed by thirty young men who broke his instrument and took away his sword
another was killed in the rue grenier saint lazare
in the rue michelle comte three officers fell dead one after the other
many of the municipal guards on being wounded in the rue des lombards be treated
in front of the four ba have a detachment of national guards found a red flag bearing the following inscription republican revolution no
was this a revolution in fact
the insurrection had made of the centre of paris a sort of inextricable tortuous colossal citadel
there was the hearth there evidently was the question
all the test was nothing but skirmishes
the proof that all would be decided the delay in the fact that there was no fighting going on the dead yet
in some regiments the soldiers were uncertain which added to the fearful uncertainty of the crisis
they're called the popular ovation which had greeted the neutrality of the dog the line in july
two intrepid men tried in great wars the marshall o bay and general bureaux were in command bureaud' under logan
enormous patrols composed of battalions of the line enclosed in entire companies of the national guard and preceded by a commissary of police wearing his scarf of office went to recon goitre the streets in rebellion
the insurgents in their side placed vidette's at the corners of all open spaces and audaciously sent their patrols outside the barricades
each side was watching the other
the government with an army in its hand hesitated the night was almost upon them and the saint merry toss in began to make itself heard
the minister of war at that time marshal soul t who had seen austerlitz regarded this with a gloomy air
these old sailor a accustomed to correct manoeuvres and having as resource and guide only tactics that compass of battles are utterly disconcerted in the presence of that immense foam which is called public wrath
the national guard for the suburbs rushed up in haste and disorder
a battalion of the thought came at a run from saint denis theft of the line arrived from courbevoie the batteries of the military school had taken up their position on the carrousel cannons were descending from vincennes
solitude was formed around the tuileries
louis philippe was perfectly serene
chapter v originality of paris during the last two years as we have said paris had witnessed more than one insurrection
nothing is generally more singularly calm than the physiognomy of paris during an uprising beyond the bounds of the rebellious quarters
paris very speedily as customs herself to anything it is only a riot and paris has so many affairs on hand that she does not put herself out for so small a matter
these colossal cities alone can offer such spectacles
these immense enclosures alone dancing win at the same time civil war and an odd and indescribable tranquillity
ordinarily when an insurrection commences when the shopkeeper hears the drum the call to arms the general alarm he contents himself with the remark there appears to be a squabble in the rue saint martin
or in the faubourg saint antoine
often he adds carelessly or somewhere in that direction
later on when the heartrending and mournful hubbub of musketry and during by platoons becomes audible the shopkeeper says it's getting hot
hullo it's getting hot
a moment later the root approaches and gains in force he shuts up his shop precipitate it hastily dogs his uniform that is to say he places his merchandise in safety and risks his own person
men fire in a squarely a passage in a blind alley they take and retake the barricade blood flows the grapes hot riddles the fronts of the houses the ball skill people in their beds corpses encumber the streets
a few streets away the shock of billiard balls can be heard in the cafes
the theatres open their doors and present vaudeville's the curious laugh and chat a couple of paces distant from these streets filled with war
hackney carriage ago their way passersby are going to a dinner somewhere in town
sometimes in the very quarter where the fighting is going on
in a fusillade was stopped to allow a wedding party to pass
at the time of the insurrection or in the rue saint martin a little inform old man pushing a hand cart surmounted by a tricolored rag in which he had carafes filled with some sort of liquid went and came from barricade to troops and from troops to the barricade offering his glasses of cocoa impartially how to the government now to anarchy
nothing can be stranger and this is the peculiar character of uprisings in paris which can not be found in any other capital
to this end two things are requisite the size of paris and its gayety
the city of voltaire and napoleon is necessary
on this occasion however in the resort to arms of jugs by the great city felt something which was perhaps stronger than itself
it was afraid
closed doors windows and shutters were to be seen everywhere in the most distant and most disinterested quarters
the courageous took to arms the polyfoon show
the busy and needless passed by disappeared
many streets were empty at fouro'clock in the morning
alarming details were hawkes about fatal news was disseminated that they were masters of the bank that there were six hundred of them in the cloister of saint merry alone entrenched and emea typed in the church that the line was not to be depended on that arm and darrel had been to see marshal clause land that the marshal had said get a regiment first that lafayette was ill but that he had said to them nevertheless i am with you
i will follow you wherever there is room for a chair that one must be on one's guard that at night there would be people pillaging isolated dwellings in the deserted corners of paris there the imagination of the police that anne radcliffe mixed up with the government was recognizable that a battery had been established in the due subrule boucher that logs hand but said we're putting their heads together and that at midnight or at daybreak at latest four columns would march simultaneously on the centre of the uprising the first coming from the bastille the second from the ports saint martin the third from the greve the fourth from the halles that perhaps also the troops would evacuate paris and withdraw to the champ de mars that no one knew what would happen but that this time it certainly was serious

why did not be attack at once
it is certain that he was profoundly absorbed
the old lion seemed to scent an unknown monster in that gloom
evening came the theatres did not open the patrols circulated with an air of irritation passersby were searched suspicious persons were arrested
by nineo'clock more than eight hundred persons had been arrested the prefecture of police was encumbered with them so was the concierge die so was la force
at the concierge die in particular the long vault which is called the rue de paris was littered with trusses of straw upon which lay a heap of prisoners whom the man of lyons lagrange harangued valiantly
all that straw rustled by all these men produced the sound of a heavy shower
elsewhere prisoners slept in the open air in the meadows piled on top of each other
anxiety reigned everywhere and a certain tremor which was not habitual with paris
people barricaded themselves in their houses wives and mothers were uneasy nothing was to be heard but this ah
my god
he has not come home
there was hardly even the distant rumble of a vehicle to be heard
people listened on their thresholds to the rumors the shouts the tumult the dull and indistinct sounds to the things that were said it is cavalry of those are the caissons galloping to the trumpets the drums the firing and above all to that lamentable a path peak from saint merry
they waited for the first cannon shot
men sprang up at the corners of the streets and disappeared shouting go home
and people made haste to bolt their doors
they said how will sol this end

book eleventh
the atom frater mixed with the hurricane chapter i. some explanations with regard to the origin of bad roche's poetry
the influence of an academician on this poetry at the instant when the insurrection arising from the shock of the populace and the military in front of the arsenal started a movement in advance and towards the rear in the multitude which was following the hearse and which through the whole length of the boulevards weighed so to speak on the head of the procession there arose a frightful ebb
the rout was shaken their tanks were broken all tangled made their escape some with shouts of attack others with the pallor of flight
the great river which covered the boulevards divided in a twinkling overflowed to right and left and spread in torrents over two hundred streets at once with the roar of a sewer that hasbro own loose
at that moment a ragged child who was coming down through the theme nil montant holding in his hands branch of blossoming laburnum which he had just plucked on the heights of belleville caught sight of an old holster pistol in the show window of africa brac merchant's shop
mother what's your name i'm going to borrow your machine
and off began with the pistol
two minutes later a flood of frightened bourgeois who were fleeing through the eu same lot and the rue based encountered the law brandishing his pistol and singing la nuit on ne doit down le jour onto it tres biend' une crib apocryphal e bourgeois's's boy riffe pratique slavery uhuru shape au point u
it was little bag roche on his way to the wars
on the boulevard he noticed that the pistol had no trigger

he was acquainted with thieves a tribe contiguous to his own
he had it appears been for three months apprenticed to a printer
he had one day executed a commission form

gav roche was a gamin of letters
moreover facto she had no suspicion of the fact that when he had offered the hospitality of his elephant to two beats on that villainous it rainy night it was to his own brothers that he had played the part of providence
his brothers in the evening his father in the morning that is what his night had been like
in quitting the rue des ballets at daybreak he had returned in haste to the elephant had artistically extracted from it the two beats had shared with them some sort of breakfast which he had invented and had then gone away confiding them to that gold mother the street who had brought him up almost entirely
on leaving them he had appointed to meet them at the same spot in the evening and had left them this discourse by way of a farewell i break a cane otherwise expressed is it mt stick or as they say at the court ifile off

the lowest depths of the actual social world are full of these lost traces
gav roche did not see them again
ten or twelve weeks had elapsed since that night
more than once he had scratched the back of his head and said where the devil are my two children
in the meantime he had arrived pistol in hand in the rue du pont aux choux
he noticed that there was but one stop open in that street and a matter worthy of reflection that was a pastry cook's shop
this presented a providential occasion to eat another apple turnover before entering the unknown
gav roche halted fumbled in his bob turned his pocket inside out found nothing not even as ok and began to shout help
it is hard to miss the last cake
nevertheless have oct e pursued his way
two minutes later he was in the rue saint louis
while traversing the rue du parc royal he felt called upon to make good the loss of the apple turnover which had been impossible and he indulged himself in the immense delight of tearing down the theatre posters in broad daylight
a little further on on catching sight of a group of comfortable looking persons who seemed to be landed proprietor she shrugged his shoulders and spit out at random before him this mouthful of philosophical file as they passed how far those moneyed men are

they eat it that's what they do
as much as their bellies will hold
chapter ii had roche on the match the brandishing of a trigger less pistol grasped in one's hand in the open street is so much of a public function that yafro she felt his fervor increasing with every moment
amid the scraps of the marseillaise which he was singing he shouted all goes well

at that moment the horse of a lancer of the national guard having fallen gave if he laid his pistol in the pavement and picked up the man then he assisted in raising the horse
after which he picked up his pistol and resumed his way

gav roche had stopped behind her and was listening
old ladies said he what do you mean by talking politics
he was assailed by a broadside composed of a quadruple bowl

what's that he's got in his paddle

all at once he heard a shout behind him it was the port read paragon who had followed him and who was shaking her fist at him in the distance and crying you're nothing but a bastard
oh

shortly afterwards he passed the hotell' amour non

chapter iii just indignation of a hairdresser the worthy hairdresser who had chased from his shop the two little fellows to whom had roche has opened the paternal interior of the elephant was at that moment in his shop engaged in shaving an old soldier of the legion who had served under the empire
they were talking
the hairdresser had naturally spoken to the veteran of the root turn of general la marque and from la marque they had passed to the emperor
thence sprang up a conversation between barber and soldier which prudhomme had he been present would have enriched with arabesques and which he would have entitled dialogue between the razor and the sword
how did the emperor rides or
said the barber
badly
he did not know how to fall so he never fell
did he have fine horses
he must have had fine horses
on the day when he gave me my cross i noticed his beast
it was a racing made perfectly white
her ears were very wide apart her saddled de la fine head marked with a blackstar a very long neck strongly articulated knees prominent ribs oblique shoulders and a powerful cd upper
a little more than fifteen hands in height
a pretty horse remarked the hairdresser
it was his majesty's beast
the hairdresser felt that after this observation a short silence would be fitting so he confirmed himself to it and then went on the emperor was never wounded but once washed it
the old soldier replied with the calm and cover right one of a man who had been there in the heel
a gratis bog
i never saw him so well dressed as on that day
he was as near as a new sou
and young
veteran you must have been often wounded
i
said the soldier am
not to amount to anything
at marengo i received two sabre blows on the back of my neck a bullet in the right arm at austerlitz another in the left hip athena
at friedland a thrust from a bayonet there at the moskow a seven or eight lance thrusts no matter where at lutsen a splinter of a shell crushed one of my fingers
ah
and then at waterloo a ball from a bid cairn in the thing that's all
how find that is
exclaimed the hairdresser in linear is accents to die on the field of battle
on my word of honor rather than die in bed of an illness slowly a bit by bit each day with drugs data plasma syringes medicines i should prefer to receive a cannonball in my belly
you're not over fastidious said the soldier
he had hardly spoken when a fearful crash shook the shop
the showwindow had suddenly been fractured
the wig maker turned pale
ch good god
he exclaimed it's one of them
what
a cannonball
herein is said the soldier
and he picked up something that was rolling about the floor
it was a pebble
the hairdresser ran to the broken window and be held had roche fleeing at the full speed towards the marche saint jean
as he passed the hairdresser's shop gave pc he who had the two beats still in his mind had not been able to resist the impulse to say good day to him and had flung a stone through his pages
you see
shrieked the hairdresser who from white had turned blue that fellow returns and does mischief for the pure pleasure of it
what has anyone done to that gamin

he wore a scarlet waistcoat and indulge ron the sort of words which break everything
his waistcoat astounded a passerby who cried in bewilderment here are the reds
the reds the reds
retorted bw hotel
a queer kind of fear bourgeois
for my part idon't tremble before a puppy the little red hat inspires me with no alarm
take my advice bourgeois let's leave fear of the red to horned cattle
he caught sight of a corner of the wall on which was load added the most peaceable sheet of paper in the worlds permission to eat eggs a lenten admonition addressed by the archbishop of paris to his flock
bw hotel exclaimed' block's polite way of saying geese
and before the charge from the jail
this conquered ga crocus
from that instant had roche set himself to study bw hotel
bw hotel observer em hold as you are wrong

this word herd of struck had roche
he sought all occasions for learning and that header down of posters possessed his sateen
he inquired of him what does her cle mean
bw hotel answered it means cursed name of a dog in latin
here bw hotel recognized at a windows pale young man with a blackbeard who was watching them as they passed probably a friend of the abc
he shouted to him quick cartridges para bellum
a fine man
that's true said had roche who now understood latin
a tumultuous retinue accompanied them students artists young men affiliated to the coin purse of a is artisans longshoremen armed with clubs and bayonets some like combe ferre with pistols thrust into their trousers
an old man who appeared to be extremely aged was walking in the band
he had no arms and he made great taste so that he might not be left behind although he had a thoughtful air
gav roche caught sight of him of use of a

in the rifles figuiere's they had met an old man walking along
what had attracted their attention was that the good man was walking in a zigzag as though he were intoxicated
moreover he had his hat in his hand although it had been raining all the morning and was raining pretty briskly at the very time
source trac had recognized father man eur
he knew him through having many times accompanied marius as far as his door
as he was acquainted with the peaceful and more than to mid habits of the old head of book collector and was amazed at the sight of him in the midst of that uproar a couple of paces from the cavalry charge's almost in the midst of a fusillade bagless in the rain and strolling about among the bullet she had accosted him and the following dialogue had been exchanged between the router of fire and the octogenarian m

and he had set out to follow them
from that moment forth he had not uttered a word
how step has suddenly become firm artisans had offered him their arms he had refused with a sign of the head
he advanced nearly to the front rank of the column with the movement of a man who is marching and the countenance of a man who is sleeping
what a fierce old fellow
muttered the students
the rumor spread through the troop that he was a former member of the convention an old regis idf

chapter vi recruits the band augmented every moment
near the rue des gillette's a man of lofty stature whose hair was turning gray and whose bold and daring josh was remarked by source trace my old as anscombe ferre but whom none of them knew joined them
gav roche who was occupied in singing whistling humming running on ahead and pounding on the shutters of the shops with the butt of his trigger less pistol paid no attention to this man
it chanced that in the rue de la ferrer if they passed in front of source urac's door
this happens just right said court eur as i have forgotten my purse and i have lost my hat
he quitted the mob and ran up to his quarters at full speed
he seized an old hat and his purse
he also seized a large square coffee of the dimensions of a large valise which was concealed under his soiled linen
as he descended against a run the port read hailed him monsieur de source trac
what's your name port ress
the port read stood bewildered
why you know perfectly well i'm the concierge my name is not hervey vain
well if you call me monsieur de source trac again i shall call you mother dev suvs in
how speak what's the matter
what do you want
there is someone who wants to speak with you
who is it

ejaculated sphere trac
but the person has been waiting your return for over an hour said the port ress
at the same time a sort of pale thin small freckles and youthful artisan clad in a tattered blouse and patched trousers of ribbed velvet and who had rather the air of a girl accout red as a man than of a man emerged from the lodge and said to source trac in a voice which was not the least in the world like a woman's voice monsieur marius if you please
he is not here
will be return this evening
i know nothing about it
and court eur as added for my part i shall not return
the young man based steadily at him and said why not
because
where are you going then
what business is that of yours
would you like to have me carry your coffee for you
i am going to the barricades
would you like to have me go with you
if you like
replies source trac
the street is free the pavements belong to everyone
and he made his escape at a run to join his friends
when he has rejoined then he gave the coffee to one of them to carry
it was only a quarter of an hour after this that he saw the young man who had actually followed them
a job does not go precisely where it intends
we have explained that a gust of wind carries it away
they overshot saint merry and found themselves without precisely knowing how in the rue saint denis
book twelfth
for in the chapter i. history of corinth e. from its foundation the parisians who nowadays on entering on the rue ram bureau at the end near the halles notice on their right opposite the rue monde tours basket baker's shop having for its signs basket in the form of napoleon the great with this inscription napoleon is made wholly of willow have no suspicion of the terrible scenes which this very spot witnessed hardly thirty years ago
it was there that lay the rue de la chambre die which ancient seeds spell changer eerie and the celebrated public house called for in the
the reader will remember all that has been said about the barricade effected at this point and eclipsed by the way by the barricade saint merry
it was on this famous barricade of the rue de la chambre die now fallen into profound obscurity that we are about hosted a little light
may we be permitted to recur for the sake of clearness in the recital to the simple means which we have already employed in the case of waterloo
persons who wish to picture to themselves in a tolerably exact manner the constitution of the houses which stood at that epoch near the points saint eustache at the northeast angle of the halles of paris where today lies the embouchure of the rue ram bureau have only to imagine any touching the rue saint denis with its summit and the maples with its base and whose two vertical bars should form the rue de la grande try and eric and the rue de la changed die and whose transverse bar should be formed by the rue de la petite try and erie
the old them once you edit the three strokes of them at the most crooked angles so that the labyrinthine confusion of these four streets sufficed to form on a space three fathoms square between the halles and the rue saint denis on the one hand and between the rue du cygne and the rue des pres heirs on the other seven islands of houses oddly cut up of varying sizes placed crosswise and haphazard and barely separated like the blocks of stone in a docu by narrow crannies
we say narrow crannies and we can give no more just idea of those dark contracted many angles alleys lined with eight story buildings
these buildings were so decrepit that in the rue de la chambre die and the rue de la petite try and erie the fronts were stored up with beams running from one house to another
the street was narrow and the gutter broad the pedestrian there walked on a pavement that was always set skirting little stalls resembling cellars big posts encircled with iron hoops excessive heaps of refuse and gates armed with enormous century old gratings
the rue ram bureau has devastated all that
the name of monde your paints marvellously well the sun uk cities of that whole set of streets
a little further on they are found still better expressed by the rus pirouette which ran into the rue monde tour
the passerby who got entangled from the rue saint denis in the rue de la chambre die be held it gradually close in before him as though he had entered an elongated funnel
at the end of this street which was very short be found further passage barred in the direction of the hailed by at all row of houses and he would have thought himself in a blind alley had he not perceived on the right and left two dark cuts through which he could make his escape
this was the rue monde tour which on one side ran into the rue de prev heirs and on the other into the rue du cygne and the petite try and erie
at the bottom of this sort of cul de sac at the angle of the cutting on the right there was to be seen a house which was not so tall as the rest and which formed a dog for sale in the street
it is in this house or two stories only that an illustrious wine shop had been merrily installed three hundred years before
this tavern created a joyous noise in the very spot which old theophilus described in the following couple tla be able lesquels tee horribled' un pauvres many qui se pandit
the situation was good and tavern keepers succeeded each other therefrom father to son
in the time of mathur in regnier this cabaret was called the pot aux roses and as there bus was then in fashion it had for its signboards post poteau painted rose color
in the last century the worthy na you're one of the fantastic masters nowadays despised by the stuff school having got drunk many times in this wine shop at the very table where regnier had drunk h i still had painted by way of gratitude a bunch of corinth grapes in the link post
the keeper of the cabaret in his joy had changed his device and had caused to be placed in gilt letters beneath the bunch these words at the bunch of corinth grapes aura is indesit in the
hence the name of corinth e
nothing is more natural to drunken men than ellipses
the ellipsis is the zigzag of the phrase
for in the gradually dethroned the pot aux roses
the last proprietor of the dynasty father michel oup no longer acquainted even with the tradition had the post painted blue
a room on the ground floor where the bar was situated one on the first floor containing a billiard tables wooden spiral staircase piercing the ceiling wine on the tables smoke on the walls candles in broad daylight this was the style of this cabaret
a staircase with a trap door in the lower room led to the cellar
on the second floor were the lodgings of the juche loup family
they were reached by a staircase which was a ladder rather than a staircase and had for their entrance only a private door in the lab've room on the first floor
under the roof in two hansard attics were the nests for the servants
the kitchen shared the ground floor with the tap room
father michel oup had possibly been born a chemist but the fact is that he was a cool people did not confine themselves to drinking alone in his wine shop they also ate there
buchel oup had invented a capital thing which could be eaten nowhere but in his house stuffed carps which he called carpe say gras
these were eaten by the light of shallow candle i got a lamp of the time of louis xvi
in tables to which see emailed waxed cloths in lieu of tablecloths
people came thither from a distance
mud hell up one fine morning had seen fit to notify passersby of this specialty he had dipped a brush in a lot of black paint and as he was an ortho grapher on his own account as well as a cook after his own fashion he had improvised on view all this remarkable inscription carles to gras
one winter the rain storms and the showers had taken a fancy to obliterate the s which terminated the first word and then which began the third this is what remained carpet or as
time and rain assisting a humble gastronomical announcement had become a profound piece of advice
in this way it came about that though he knew no french father michel oup understood latin that he had evoked philosophy from his kitchen and that desirous simply of effacing lent he had equalled horace
and the striking thing about it was that that also meant enter my wine shop
nothing of all this is in existence now
the monde your labyrinth was risen bowel led and widely opened in and probably no longer exists at the present moment
the rue de la chambre rid and for in the have disappeared beneath the pavement of the rue ram bureau
as we have already said forint he was the meeting place if not the rallying point of source trac and his friends
it was grant aide who had discovered for in the
he had entered it on account of the carpet or as and had returned thither on account of the carpe say gras
there they drank there they are there they shouted they did not pay much they paid badly they did not pay at all but they were always welcome
father michel oup was a jovial host
michel oup that amiable manassas just said was a wine shopkeeper with a mustache an amusing variety
he always had an ill tempered air seemed to wish to intimidate his customers grumbled at the people who entered his establishment and had rather them is not seeking a quarrel with them than of serving them with soup
and yet we insist upon the word people were always welcome there
this oddity had attracted customers to his ship and brought him young men who said to each other come hear father michel oup growl
he had been a fencing master
all of a sudden he would burst out laughing
an invoice a good fellow
he had a comic foundation under a tragic exterior he asked nothing better than to frighten you very much like those snuff boxes which are in the shape of a pistol
the detonation makes one sneeze
mother his hell up his wife was a bearded and a very timely creature
about father michel oup died
with him disappeared the secret of stuffed carps
his inconsolable widow continued to keep the wine shop
but the cooking deteriorated and became execrable the wine which had always been bad became fearfully bad
nevertheless source gras and his friends continued to go to corinth e out of pity as bosquet said
the widow michel oup was breathless and misshapen and given to rustic recollections
she deprives them of their flatness by her pronunciation
she had a way of her own if saying things which spiced her reminiscences of the village and other springtime
it had formerly been her delight so she affirmed to hear the loup see gorge routes gorges changer dans les ogre line say he lines to hear the red breasts sing in the hawthorn trees
the hall on the first floor where the rest ahrq it was situated was a large and long apartment encumbered with stools chairs benches and tables and with a crippled lake old billiard table
it was reached by a spiral staircase which terminated in the corner of the room at a square hole like the hatch way of a ship
this room lighted by a single narrow window and by a lamp that was always burning had the aurora garret
all the four footed furniture completed itself as though it had but three legs the whitewashed walls had for their only ornament the following quatrain in honor of mandy us help joel per tonne as i do a seller louden tea deux i never rush white ensign e zh sssr deux on tremble a chaque instantqu'elle ne vous lamp is bestqu'un beau your sonne and tom've dans sa bouche
this was scrawled in charcoal on the wall
make his hell up a good likeness went and came from morning till night before this quatrain with the most perfect tranquillity
two serving maids named may elite and give ports and who had never been known by any other names helped make his hell up to set on the tables the jugs of poor wine and the various broths which were served to the hungry patrons in earthenware bowls
may elite large plump red haired and noisy the favorite ex sultans of the defunct much sloop was home lien than any mythological monster belt what it may still as it becomes the servant to always keep in the rear of the mistress she was less homely than make his hell up
give litter all delicate white with a lymphatic pallor with circle around her eyes and dropping kids always languid and weary afflicted with what may be called chronic lassitude the first up in the house and the lasting we waited on everyone even the other maid silently and gently smiling through her carl tue with a vague and sleepy smile
before entering the restaurant room the visitor read on the door the following line written therein shall by source trac regale city of hartman yes it up' oses
chapter ii preliminary gay stirs laurie de meaux as the reader knows livermore with holy than elsewhere
he had a lodging as a bird has one on a branch
the two friends lived together ate together slept together
they had everything in common even music jetta to some extent
they were what the subordinate monks who accompany monks are called bin i
on the morning of the th of june they went to corinth who breakfast
holy who was all stuffed up had a catarrh which lainie was beginning to share
lainie's coat was threadbare but holy was well dressed
it was about nineo'clock in the morning when they opened the door of corinth e
they ascended to the first floor
made lots and give lotte received them
oysters cheese and ham said laurie
and they seated themselves at a table
the wine shop was empty there was no one there but themselves
give lotte knowing holy and lainie sets bottle of wine on the table
while they were busy with their first oysters ahead appeared at the hatch way of the staircase and a voice said i am passing by
i smell from the streets delicious odor of brie cheese
i enter
it was grant site
grant sure took a stool and drew up to the table
at the sight of grant wire give lot replaced two bottles of wine on the table
that made three
are you going to drink those two bottles
la it is inquired of grant aire
grant site replied all are ingenious thou alone art ingenious
two bottles never yet astonished a man
the others had begun by eating grant wire began by drinking
half a bottle was rapidly gulped down
so you have a hole in your stomach
began lainie again
you have one in your elbow said grant aird
and after having emptied his glass he added am by the way la kyle of the funeral oration your coat is old
i should hope so retorted pai gow
that's why we get on well together by coat and i
it has acquired all my folds it does not find me anywhere it is moulded in my deformities it falls in with all my movements i am only conscious of it because it keeps me warm
old costs are just like old friends
that's true ejaculated join striking into the dialogue an old goat is an old ab i am i friend
especially in the mouth of a man whose head is stuffed up said grant aire
grant site demanded lainie have you just come from the boulevard
mo
we have just seen the head of the procession pass holy and i
it's a marvellous sight said joly
how quiet this street is
exclaimed l aigle
who would suspect that paris was turned upside down
how plainly it is to be seen that in former days there were nothing but consent share
in this neighborhood
din rail and caudal give a list of them and so does the angel en eur
they were all round here they fairly swarmed booted and barefooted shaven bearded gray black white franciscans minima capuchin's carmelites little augustine c great augustine's old augustine's there was no end of them
don't let's talk of monks interrupted grant sure it makes one want to scratch one's self
then he exclaimed bout
i've just swallowed a bad oyster
now hypochondria is taking possession of me again
the oysters are spoiled the servants are ugly
i hate the human race
i just passed through the rue ridge list in front of the big public library
that pile of oyster shells which is called a library is disgusting even to think of
what paper
what inn
what's crawling
and all that has been written
what rascal was it who said that man was a feather less biped
and then i met a pretty girl of my acquaintance who is as beautiful as the spring worthy to be called flores land who is delighted enraptured as happy as the angels because a wretch yesterday a frightful banker all spotted with smallpox deigned to take a fancy to her
alas
woman keeps on the watch for a protector as much as for a lover cats chase mice as well as birds
two months ago that young woman was virtuous in an attic she adjusted little brass rings in the eyelet holes of corsets what do you call it
she sewer she had a camp beds he dwelt beside a lot of flowers she was contented
no where she is a bank dress
this transformation took place last night
i met the victim this morning in high spirits
the hideous point about it is that the jade i was pretty today as she was yesterday
her financier did not show interface
roses have this advantage of disadvantage over women that the traces left upon them by caterpillars are visible
ah
there is no morality on earth
i fall to witness the myrtle the symbol of love the laurel the symbol of air the olive that ginny the symbol of peace the apple tree which came nearest dangling adam with its lips and the figtree the grandfather of petticoats

ah
what beasts of prey there are in this world
what eagles
it makes my flesh creep
he held out his glass to holy who filled it then he drank and went on having hardly been interrupted by this glass of wine of which no one not even himself had taken any notice been bus who takes time is an eagle the banker who takes they rosette is an eagle
there is no more modesty in the one case than in the other
so we believe in nothing
there is nutone reality drink
whatever your opinion may be in favor of the lean cock like the canton of uri or in favor of the fat cock like the canton of glarus it matters little drink
you talk home of the boulevard of that profession etc after a etc. after a
come now is the're going to be another revolution
this poverty of means on the part of the good god astounds me
he has to keep greasing the groove of events every moment
there is a hitch itwon't work
quick a revolution
the good god has his hands perpetually black with that cart grease
if i were in his place i'd be perfectly simple about it i would not wind up my mechanism every minute i'd lead the human race in a straightforward way i'd weave matters mesh by mesh without breaking the thread i would have no provisional arrangements i would have no extraordinary repertory
what the rest of you call progress advanced by means of two motors men and events
but sad to say from time to time the exceptional becomes necessary
the ordinary troupe suffices neither for event nor for men among men geniuses are required among events revolutions
great accidents are the iaw the order of things can not do without them and judging from the apparition of comets one would be tempted to think that heaven itself finds actors needed for its performance
at the moment when one expects it the least god placards a meteor on the wall of the firmament
some queer star turns up underlined by an enormous tail
and that causes the death of caesar
brutus deals him a blow with a knife and god aglow with a comet
crac and behold an aurora borealis behold a revolution behold a great man' in big letters napoleon on guard the comet of at the head of the poster
ah
what a beautiful blue theatre all studded with unexpected flashes
blum
blum
extraordinary show
raise your eyes boobies
everything is in disorder the star as well as the drama
good for it is too much and not enough
these resources gathered from exception seem magnificence and poverty
my friends providence had come down to expedients
what does a revolution prove
that god is in a quandry
he effects a coupd' etat because he god has not been able to make both ends meet
in fact this confirms me in my conjecture was to jehovah's fortune and when i see so much distress in heaven and on earth from the bird who has not a grain of millet to myself without a hundred thousand livres of income when i see human destiny which is very badly worn and even royal destiny which is threadbare witness the prince seconds hung when i see winter which is nothing but agent in the zenith through which the wind blows when i see so many tags even in the perfectly new purple of the morning on the crests of hills when i see the drops of dew those mock pearls when i see the frost that paste when i see humanity ripped apart and events patched up and so many spots on the sun and so many holes in the moon when i see so much misery everywhere i suspect that god is not rich
the appearance exists it is true but i feel that he is hard up
he gives a revolution as a tradesman whose money box is empty gives a ball
god must not be judged from appearances
beneath the gilding of heaven i perceive a poverty stricken universe
creation is bankrupt
that is why i am discontented
here it is the th of june it is almost night ever since this morning i have been waiting for daylight to come it has not come and i bet that itwon't come all day
this is the in exactness of an ill laid clerk
yes everything is badly arranged nothing fits anything else this old world is all warped i take my stand on the opposition everything goes awry the universe is a tease
it's like children those who want them have gone and those whodon't want them have them
total i'm vexed
besides la of less meaux that bald head offends my sight
it humiliates me to think that i am of the same areas that baldy
however i criticise but i do not insult
the universe is what it is
i speak here without evil intent and to ease my conscience
receive eternal father the assurance of my distinguished consideration
ah
by all the saints of olympus and by all the gods of paradise i was not intended to be a parisian that is to say to rebound forever like a shuttlecock between two battlefords from the group of the loungers to the group of the royster ers
i was made to be a turk watching oriental hour is all day long executing those exquisite egyptian dances as sensuous as the dream of a chaste manor a beauceron peasant or a venetian gentleman surrounded by gentle women ira petty german prince furnishing the half of a foot soldier to the germanic confederation and occupying his leisure with drying his breeches on his hedge that is to say his frontier
those are the positions for which i was born
yes i have said a turk and i will not retract
i do not understand how people can habitually take turks in bad part mohammed had his good points respect for the inventor of seraglio's with your us and paradises with oral issues
let us not insult mohammedan i am the only religion which is ornamented with agent post
now i insist on a drink
the earth is a great piece of stupidity
and it appears that they are going to fight all those imbeciles and to break each other's profiles and to massacre each other in the heart of summer in the month of june when they might go off with a creature on their arm to breathe the immense heaps of new mien tay in the meadows
really people do commit altogether too many follies
an old broken lantern which i have just seen at africa brac merchant's suggests a reflection to my mind it is time to enlighten the human race
yes be told me sad again
that's what comes of swallowing an oyster and a resolution the wrong way
i am growing melancholy once more
oh
frightful old world
people strive turn each other out prostitute themselves kill each other and get used to it
and grant sore after this bit of eloquence had a bit of coughing which was well earned
apropos of revolution said july it is decidedly afferent that varius id in lub

no
dp
i tell you

exclaimed grant site
i can imagine it
marius is a fog and he must have found a vapor
marius is of the race of poets
he who says post says book madman gym brady's apollo
marius and his marie or his marion of his maria or his marietta
they must make a queer pair of lovers
i know just what it is like
ecstasies in which they forget to kiss
pure on earth but joined in heaven
they are could possessed of senses
they lie among the stars
grant site was attacking his second bottle and possibly his second harangue when a new persons he emerged from the square aperture of the stairs
it was a boy less than ten years of age ragged very small yellow with an off ph is a vivacious eye an enormous amount of hair drenched with rain and wearing a contented air
the child unhesitatingly making his choice among the three addressed himself to lair less means
are you monsieur bosquet
that is my nickname replied l aigle
what do you want with me
this
a tall blonde fellow on the boulevard said to me' do you know mother much eko up
' i said' yes rusch and eerie the old man's widow' he said to me' got here

' it's a joke that they're playing on youisn't it

the child replied ican'ti belong in the process lot i'm the one to shout' down with poll gnat
' and executing a prolonged scrape of his foot behind him which is the most respectful of all possible salute she took his departure
the child gone grant site took the word that is the purebred ramon
there are a great many varieties of the gamin species
the notary's gam it is called skip the gutter the cook's gamin is called a scullion the baker's gamin is called a mite on the packet's gamin is called a groom the marine gamin is called the cabin boy the soldier's gamin is called the drummer boy the painter's gamin is called paint grinder the tradesman's gamin is called an errand boy the courts sangamon is called the minion the kingly gamin is called the dauphin the god gamin is called the bambino
in the meantime i aigle was engaged in reflection he said half a loud and that is to say the burial of la marque
the tall blonde remarked grant site is an moira's who is sending you a warning
shall we go
ejaculated bosquet
it's raising said joly
i have sworn to go through fire but not through water
kdon'ts andromeda gold
i shall stay here said grant site
i prefer a breakfast to a hearse
conclusion we remain said i aigle
well then let us drink
besides we might miss the funeral without missing the riot
ah
the riot i am with you
cried joly
lainie rubbed his hands
how we're going to touch up the revolution of
as a matter of fact it does hurt the people along the seams
idon't think much of your revolution said grant aire
idon't exec rate this government
it is the crown tempered by the cotton nightcap
it is a sceptre ending in an umbrella
infact i think that today with the present weather louis philippe might utilize his royalty in two directions he might extend the top of the sceptre end against the people and open the umbrella end against heaven
the room was dark large clouds had just finished the extinction of daylight
there was no one in the wine shop or in the street everyone having gone off to watch events
is it midday or midnight
cried foss jet
youcan't see your hand before your face
give lotte fetch a light
grant site was drinking in a melancholy way
enjoi race iscsi name he muttered
enjoi rae said' holy i will grant site is drunk
' it was to bosch et that he sent have t
if he had come for me i would have followed him
so much the worse for enjoi rss
idon't go to his funeral
this resolution once arrived at bossier holy and grant sure did not stir from the wine shop
by twoo'clock in the afternoon the table at which they say was covered with empty bottles
two candles were burning only one in a flat copper candlestick which was perfectly green the other in the neck of a cracked carafe
grant wife had seduced holy and bossier to wine bosquet and holy had conducted grant wire back towards cheerfulness
as for grants or she had got beyond wine that merely moderate inspired of dreams ever since mid day
wine enjoys only a conventional popularity with serious drinkers
there is in fact in the matter of one brief y white magic and black magic wine is only white magic
grant site was wearing drinker of dreams
the blackness of a terrible bit of drunkenness yawning before him far from arresting him attracted him
he had abandoned the bottle and taken to the beer glass
the beer glass is the abyss
having neither opium nor has just on hand and being desirous of filling his brain with twilight he had had recourse to that fearful mixture of brandy's to it absinthe which produces the most terrific of let harries
it is of these three vapors beer brandy and absinthe that the lead of the soul is composed
they are three grooms the celestial butterfly is drowned in them and there are formed therein a membranous smoke vaguely condensed into the wing of the bat three mute furies nightmare night and death which hover about the slumbering psyche
grant wife had not yet reached that lamentable phase far from it
he was tremendously gay and bossier and holy retorted
they c linked glasses
grant sure added to the eccentric accentuation of words and ideas a peculiarity of gesture he rested his left fist on his knee with dignity his arm forming a right angle and with cravat untied seated astride a stool his full glass in his right hand he hurled solemn words at the big maidservant may elite let the doors of the palace be thrown open
let everyone be a member of the french academy and have the right to embrace madame niche logo
let us drink
and turning to madame michel oup he added woman ancient and consecrated by use draw near that i may contemplate the e
and holy exclaimed may elite and novell thedid't gov grants in a anything more to drink
he has already devoured since this birding in wild prodigal ity two france and ninety five centives
and grant wire began again who has been in hooking the stars without my permission and putting them on the table in the guise of candles
bosquet though very drunk preserved his equanimity
he was seated on the sill of the open window setting his back in the falling rain and gazing at his two friends
all at once he heard a tumult behind him hurried footsteps cries of to arms
he turned round and saw in the rue saint denis at the end of the rue de la chambre given no less passing gun in hand and had to che with his pistol be jolly with his sword court eur as with his sword and jean proud site with his blunder buses om de terre with his gun bw hotel with his gun and the whole armed and stormy rabble which was following them
the rue de lady and eerie was not more than a gunshot long
bossier improvised a speaking trumpet from his two hands placed around his mouth and shouted source trac
court by rss
house
coutts trac heard the shout caught sight of bosquet and advanced a few paces into the rue de la chambre die shouting what do you want
which crossed ad here are you going
to make a barricade replied source trac
well here
this is a good place
make it here
that's true aigle said coutts trac
am data signal from source trac them off lung themselves into the rue de la chambre rie
chapter iii night begins to descend upon grant aire the spot was in fact admirably adapted the entrance to the street widened out the other extremity narrowed together into a pocket without exit
for in the created an obstacle the rue monde tour was easily barricaded on the right and the left no attack was possible except from the rue saint denis that is today in front and in full sight
boss key had the comprehensive glance of a fasting hannibal
terror had seized on the whole street at their rupt job of the moh
there was not a passerby who did not get out of sight
in the space of a flash of lightning in the rear to right and left shops stables area doors windows blinds at his skylights shutters of every description were closer from the ground floor to the food
a terrified old woman fixed a mattress in front of her window on two clothes poles for drying linen in order to deaden the effect of musketry
the wine shop alone remained open and that for a very good reason that the mob had rushed into it
at my god
at my god
signed make his hell up
bossier had gone down to meet source trac
holy who had placed himself at the window exclaimed court eur as you ought to have brought an umbrella
you will hatch gold
in the meantime in the space of a few minutes twenty iron bars had been wrenched from the heated front of the wine shop ten fathoms of street had been in paved had roche and ba model had seized in its passage and overturned the fray of a line dealer name dance au this drag contained three barrels of lime which they placed beneath the likes of paving stones en no less raised the cellar trap and all the widow michel php's empty casks were used to flank then a reels of lime be jolly with his fingers skilled in painting the delicate sticks of fans had backed up the barrels and the fray with two massive heaps of blocks of rough stone
blocks which were improvised like the rest and procured no one knows where
the beams which served as props were torn from the neighboring house fronts and laid on the casks
when bosquet and source trac turned round half the street was already barred with a rampart higher than a man
there is nothing like the hand of the populace for building everything that is built by demolishing
may slots and give lotte had mingled with the workers
give lotte went and came loaded with rubbish
her lassitude helped on the barricade
she served the barricade as she would have served wine with a sleepy air
an omnibus with two white horses passed the end of the street
bossier strode over the paving stones ran to it stopped the driver made the passengers a light offered his hand to the ladies dismissed the conductor and returned leading the vehicle and the horses by the bridle
omnibuses said he do not pass the cor in the
non liver omnibus a fire corinth uk
an instant later the horses were in harnessed and went off at their will through the rue mon detour and the omnibus lying on its side completed the bar across the street

her eyes were vague and stared without seeing anything and she cried in a low tone
her terrified shrieks did not dare to emerge from her throat
the end of the world has come she muttered
holy deposited a kiss on name juche pojo's fat red wrinkled neck and said to grant wire my dear fellow i have always regarded a woman's neck as an infinitely delicate thing
but grant site attained to the highest regions of with ryan b
may elite had mounted to the first floor once more grant site seized her round her waist and gave vent to long bursts of laughter at the window
matt lord is to melt
he cried may elite is of a dream of ugliness

this is the secret of her birth a gothic pygmalion who was making gargoyles for cathedrals fell in love with one of them the most horrible one fine morning
he be sought love to give it life and this produced mate lots

i understand only love and liberty

i picture myself jesus christ with rothschild's fortune
how much good he would do
may elite embrace me
you are voluptuous and timid
you have cheeks which invite the kiss of a sister and lips which claim the kiss of a lover
hold your tongue you casi
said courts trac
grant site retorted i am the capito up and the master of the floral games
enjoi rss who was standing on the crest of the barricade tuning and raised his beautiful austere face
enjoi gas as the reader knows had something of the spartan end of the puritan in his composition
he would have perished at thermopylae with leonidas and burned at drogheda with cromwell
grant sure he shouted to get rid of the fumes of your wine somewhere else than here
this is the place for enthusiasm not for drunkenness
don't disgrace the barricade
this angry speech produced a singular effect on grant aire
one would have said that he had had a glass of cold water flung in his face
he seemed to be rendered suddenly sober
he sat down put his elbows on a table near the window looked when i'll ras with indescribable gentleness and said to him let me sleep here
go and sleep somewhere else frieden no less
but grant wire still keeping his tender and troubled eyes fixed on him replied let me sleep here until i die
enjoi rss regarded him with disdainful eyes grant sure you are incapable of believing of thinking of willing of living and of dying
grant site replied in a grave tone you will see
he stammered a few more unintelligible words then his head fell heavily on the table and as is the usual effect of the second period of inet fiery into which enjoi rashad roughly and abruptly thrust him an instant later he had fallen asleep

mother michel oup weren't you complaining the other day because you had had a notice served on you for infringing the law because give lotte shook a counterpane out of your window
he's my good monsieur source trac
ah
good heavens are you going to put that table of mine in your horror top
and it was for the counter page and also for a lot of flowers which fell from the attic window into the street that the government collected a fine of a hundred francs
if thatisn't an abomination what is
well mother michel oup we are avenging you
mother michel oup did not appear to understand very clearly the benefit which she was to derive from these reprisals made on her account
she was satisfied after the manner of that arab woman who having received a box on the far from her husband went to complain to her father and cried for vengeance saying father you owe my husband affront for affront
the father asked on which cheek did you receive the flow
on the left cheek
the father slapped her right cheek and said now you are satisfied
go tell your husband that he boxed my daughter's ears and that i have accordingly boxed his wife's
the rain had ceased
recruits had arrived
workmen had brought under their blouses a barrel of powder a basket containing bottles of vitriol two or three carnival torches and a basket filled with fire pits leftover from the king's festival
this festival was very recent having taken place on the storm at

two barricades were now in process of construction at once both of them resting on the cor in the house and forming a right angle the larger shut off the rue de la chambre r is the other closed the rue mom detour on the side of the rue de cygne
this last barricade study was very narrow was constructed only of casks and paving stones
there were about fifty workers on it thirty were armed with guns for on their way they had effected a wholesale loan from an admirer's shop
nothing could be more bizarre and at the same time more motley than this troop
one had around jackets cavalry sabre and two holster pistols another was in his shirt sleeves with around hat and a powder horn's lungs this side a third word all astron of fine sheets of gray paper and was armed with a saddler's awl
there was one who was shouting let us exterminate them to the last man and die at the point of our bayonet
this man had no bayonet
another spread out over his coat the cross belt and cartridge box of a national guardsman the cover of the carer page box being ornamented with this inscription in red worsted public order
there were a great many guns bearing the numbers of the legion see what's no cravat's many bare arms some pikes
add to this all ages all sorts of faces small pale young men and bronzed longshoremen
all were in haste and as they helped each other they discussed the possible chances
that they would receive succor about threeo'clock in the morning that they were sure of one regiment that paris would rise
terrible sayings with which was mingled a sort of cordial jovial ity
one would have pronounced them brothers but they did not know eachother's names
great perils have this fine characteristic that they bring to light the fraternity of strangers
a fire had been lighted in the kitchen and there they were engaged in moulding into bullets pewter mugs spoons forms and all the brass tableware of the establishment
in the midst of it all they drank
caps and buckshot were mixed pell mellon the tables with glasses of wine
in the billiard ball make much too up mate lots and give lotte variously modified by terror which had stupefied one rendered another breathless and roused the third were tearing up old wish cloths and making lint three insurgents were assisting them three busty haired jolly blades with beards and moustaches who plucked away at the linen with the fingers of seamstresses and who made them tremble
the man of lofty stature whom source trac combed stream denko least we observed at the moment when he joined the job at the corner of the rue des gillette's was at work on the smaller barricade and was making himself useful there
gav roche was working on the larger one
as for the young man who had been waiting for cour de graca this lodgings and who had inquired form
marine he had disappeared at about the time when the omnibus had been overturned
gav roche completely carried away and radiant had undertaken to get everything in readiness
he went came mounted descended remounted whistled and sparkles
he seemed to be there for the encouragement of all
had me any incentive
yes certainly his poverty had he wings
yes certainly his joy
gav roche was a whirlwind
he was constantly visible he was incessantly audible
he filled the air as he was everywhere at once
he was a sort of almost irritating ubiquity no half was possible with him
the enormous barricade felt him on its haunches
he troubled the loungers be excited the idle be reanimated the weary he grew impatient over the thoughtful he inspired gayety income and breath in other's wrath in others movement in all now pricking a student now hiring an artisan he alighted paused flew off again hovered over the tumult and the effort sprang from one party to another murmuring and humming and harassed the whole company a fly on the immense revolutionary coach
perpetual motion was in his little arms and perpetual clamoring is little lungs

this elicited an exclamation from the workers
a glass door
what do you expect us to do with a glass door tubercle
hercules yourselves
retorted had roche
a glass door is an excellent thing in a barricade
it does not prevent an attack but it prevents the enemy taking it
so you've never l rigged apples over a wall where there were broken bottles
a glass door cuts the forms of the national guard when they try to mount on the barricade

chapter v preparations the journals of the day which said that that nearly impregnable structure of the barricade of the rue de la chambre for as they call it reached to the level of the first floor were mistaken
the fact is that it did not exceed an average height of six or seven feet
it was built in such a manner that the combatants could at their will either disappear behind it or dominate the barrier and even scale its crest by means of a quadruple row of paving stones placed on top of each other and arrange was steps in the interior
on the outside the front of the barricade composed of piles of paving stones and casks bound together by beams and planks which were entangled in the wheels of an cray's drag and of the overturned omnibus had a bristling and inextricable aspect
an aperture large enough to allow a man to pass through had been made between the wall of the houses and the extremity of the barricade which was furthest from the wine shop so that an exit was possible at this point
the pole of the omnibus was placed upright and held up with ropes and a red flag fastened to this pole floated over the barricade
the little monde your barricade hidden behind the wine shop building was not visible
the two barricades united formed a veritable redoubt
enjoi gas and source trac had not thought fit to barricade the other fragment of the turn on detour which opens through the rue des pres heirs an issue into the halles wishing no doubt to preserve a loss in la communication with the outside and not entertaining much fear of an attack through the dangerous and difficult street of the rue des pres heure
with the exception of this issue which was left free and which constituted what folate in his strategical style would have termed a branch and taking into account also the narrow cutting arranged on the rue de lacy and eerie the interior of the barricade where the wine shop formed a salient angle presented an irregular square closed in all sides
there existed an interval of twenty paces between the grand barrier and the lofty houses which formed the background of the street so that one might say that the barricade rested on these houses all inhabited but closed from top to bottom
all this work was performed without any hindrance in less than an hour and without this handful of gold men seeing a single bearskin cap or a single bayonet make their appearance
the very bourgeois who still ventured at this hour of riot to enter the rue saint denis cast a glance at the rue de lacy and eerie caught sight of the barricade and redoubled their pace
the two barricades being finished and the flag run up a table was dragged out of the wine shop and source trac mounted on the table
enjoi rss brought the square coffee and source trac open edit
this coffee was filled with cartridges
when the job saw the cartridges a tremor ran through the bravest and a momentary silence ensued
source trac distributed them with a smile
each one received thirty cartridges
many had powder and set about making others with the bullets which they had run
as for the barrel of powder it stood on a table on one side near the door and was held in reserve
the spark be at which ran through all paris did not cease but it had finally come to be nothing more than a monotonous boise to which they no longer paid any attention
this noise retreated at times and again drew near with melancholy undulations
they loaded the guns and carbines all together without haste with solemn gravity
enjoi rss went and stationed three sentinels outside the barricades one in the rue de la chan free of the second in the rue des pres heirs the third at the corner of the rue de la petite try and erie
then the barricades having been built the posts assigned the guns loaded the sentinels stationed they waited alone in those redoubtable streets through which no one passed any longer surrounded by those dumb houses which seemed dead and in which no human movement pal pirated enveloped in the deepening shades of twilight which was drawing on in the midst of that silence through which something could be felt advancing and which had about it something tragic and terrifying isolated armed determined and tranquil
chapter vi waiting during those hours of waiting what did they do
we must needs tell since this is a matter of history
while the men made bullets and the women long while a large saucepan of melted brass and lead destined to the bullet mould smoked over a glowing brazier while the sentinels watched weapon in hand on the barricades hold em hold as whom it was impossible to divert kept an eye on the sentinels com never resource track fanpro i faire de kill those yet no luna hotel and some others sought each other out and united as in the most peaceful days of their conversations in their student life and in one corner of this wine shop which had been converted into a casement a couple of paces distant from there doubt which they had built with their carbines loaded and primed resting against the backs of their chairs these fine young fellows so close to a supreme your began to recite life verses

the hour the spot these souvenirs of youth recalled a few stars which began to twinkle in the sky the funeral repose of those deserted streets the imminence of the inexorable adventure which was in prepara room gave a pathetic charm to these verses murmured in a low tone in the disk by jean proud wired up as we have said was a gentle post
in the meantime a lamp had been lighted in the small barricade and in the large one one of those was torches such as are to be met within shrove tuesday in front of vehicles loaded with masks on their way to la cour tille
these torches as the reader has seen came from the faubourg saint antoine
the torch had been placed in a sort of care of paving stones closed on three sides to shelter it from the wind and disposed in such a fashion that all the light fell on the flag
the street and the barricade remained sunk in gloom and nothing was to be seen except the red flag for mid a bit illuminated as by an enormous dark lantern
this light enhanced the scarlet of the flag with an indescribable and terrible purple
chapter vii the man recruited in the rue des gillette's night was fully come nothing made its appearance
all that they heard was confused noises and at intervals fusillade's but these were rare badly sustained and distant
this despite which was thus prolonged was a sign that the government was taking its time and collecting its forces
these fifty men were waiting for sixty thousand
en your ad felt attacked by that impatience which seized on strong souls on the threshold of redoubtable events
he went in search of bad roche who had set to making cartridges in the tap room by the dubious light of two candles placed on the counter by way of precaution on account of the powder which was scattered on the tables
these two candles cast not leak outside
the insurgent'd had moreover taken pains not to have any light in the upper stories
gav roche was deeply preoccupied at that moment but not precisely with his cartridges
the man of the rue des gillette's had just entered the tap room and had seated himself at the table which was the least lighted
a musket of large model had fallen to his share and he held it between his legs
gav roche who had been up to that moment distracted by a hundred amusing things had not even seen this man
when he entered facto she followed him mechanically with his eyes admiring his gun then all at once when the man was seated the street urchin sprang to his feet
anyone who has spied upon that many phl that moment would have seen that he was observing everything in the barricade and in the band of insurgents with singular attention but from the moment when he had entered this room he had fallen into a sort of brown study and no longer seemed to see anything that was going on
the gamut approached this pensive personage and began to step around him on tiptoe as one walks in the vicinity of a person whom one is afraid of waking
at the same time over his childish countenance which was at once so impudent and so serious so giddy and so profound so gay and so heartbreaking passed all those grimaces of an old man which signify an bag
impossible
my sight is bad
i am dreaming
can this be
no it is not
but yes
why no
etc.
gav roche balanced on his heels clenched both fists in his pockets moved his neck around like a bird expended in a gigantic pour all the sagacity of his lower lip
he was astounded uncertain incredulous convinced dazzled
he had them is not the chief of the eunuchs in the slave mart discovering avenue among the glossy females and the air of an amateur recognizing a raphael in a heap of day bs
his whole being was at work the instinct which scents out and the intelligence which combines
it was evident that a great event had happened in gave pc he's life
it was at the most intense point of this preoccupation that em hold as accosted him
you are small said em hold as you will not be seen
go out of the barricades lips long close to the houses skirmish about a bit in the streets and come back and tell me what is going on
gav focus raised himself on his haunches
so the little chaps are good for something
that's very lucky
i'll go
in the meanwhile trust to the little fellows and distrust the big ones
and had roche raising his head and lowering his voice added as he indicated the man of the rue des gillett we do you see that big fellow there
well
he's a police sky
are you sure if it
itisn't two weeks since he pulled me off the cornice of the port royal where i was taking the air by my ear
enjoi rss hastily quitted the urchin and murmured a few words in a very low tone to a longshoreman from the wine rocks who chanced to be at hand
the man left the room and returned almost immediately accompanied by three others
the four men four porters with broad shoulders went and placed themselves without doing anything to attract his attention behind the table on which the man of the rue des bill edges was leaning with his elbows
they were evidently ready to hurl themselves upon him
the menu old as approached the man and demanded of him who are you
at this abrupt query the man started
he plunged his gaze deep into enjoi rae' clear eyes and appeared to grasp the latter's meaning
he smiled with a smile than which nothing more disdainful more energetic and more resolute could be seen in the world and replied with haughty gravity i see what it is
well yes
you are a police spy
i am an agent of the authorities
and your name
javert
enjoi rss made a sign to the four men
in the twinkling of an eye before javert had time to turn round he was collared thrown down pink ones and searched
they found on him a little round card lasted between two pieces of glass and bearing on one side the arms of france engraved and with this motto supervision and vigilance and on the other this note javert inspector of police aged fifty two and the signature of the prefect of police of that day m
bosquet
besides this he had his watch and his purse which contained several gold pieces
they left him his purse and his watch
under the watch at the bottom of his bob they felt and seized a paper in an envelope which enjoi raw unfolded and on which he read these five lines written in the very hand of the prefect of police as soon as his political mission is accomplished inspector javert will make sure by special supervision whether it is true that the malefactors have instituted intrigues on the right bank of the seine near the jena bridge
the search ended they lifted javert to his feet bound his arms behind his back and fastened him to that celebrated post in the middle of the room which had formerly given the wine shop its name
gav roche who had looked on at the whole of this scene and had approved if everything with a silent toss of his head stepped up to javert and said to him it's the mouse who has taught the cat
all this was so rapidly executed that it was all over when those about the wine shop noticed it
javert had not uttered a single cry
at the sight of javert bound to the post source trac box diet holy combe ferre and the men scattered over the two gate is a few came running up
javert with his back to the post and so surrounded with ropes that he could not make a movement raised his head with the intrepid serenity of the man who has never lied
he is a police spy said enjoi rss
and turning to javert you will be shot ten minutes before the barricade is taken
javert replied in his most imperious to me why not at once
we are saving our powder
then finish the business with a flow from a knife
spy said the handsome em hold as we are judges and not assassins
then he called have oct where you

and halting as he was on the point of setting out by the way you will give me his gun
and he added i leave you the musician but i want the clarion e f
the gamin made the military salute and passed gayly through the opening in the large barricade
chapter viii many interrogation points with regard to a certain less bus whose name may not have been less buf the tragic picture which we have undertaken could not be complete the reader would not see those grand moments of social birth pangs in a revolutionary birth which contain convulsion mingled with effort in their exact and real relief were we took it in the sketch here outlined an incident full of epic and savage horror which occurred almost immediately after had roche's departure
hogs as the reader knows are like a snowball and collect as they roll along a throng of tumultuous men
these men do not ask each other whence they come
among the passersby who had joined the rabble led by enjo orascom be ferre and court eye as there had been a person wearing the jacket of a street porter which was very threadbare on the shoulders whores to culated and do view rates and who had the look of a drunken savage
this man whose name or nickname was less bus and who was moreover an utter stranger to those who pretended to know him was very drunk or assumed the appearance of being so she had seated himself with several other data table which they had dragged outside of the wine shop
this can uc while making those who died with him drunk seemed to be examining with a thoughtful air the large house at the extremity of the barricade whose five stories commanded the whole street and faced the rue saint denis
all at once he exclaimed do you know comrades it is from that house yonder that we must fire
when we are at the windows the deuce is in it is anyone can advance into the street
yes but the house is closed said one of the drinkers
let us knock
they will not open
let us break in the door
lec a bus runs to the door which had a very massive knocker and knocks
the door opens not
he strikes a second blow
no one answers
a third strike
the same silence
is the rf anyone here
shouts fanuc
nothing store
then he seized a gun and begins to gather the door with the butt end
it was an ancient alley door low vaulted narrow solid entirely of osk lines on the inside with a sheet of iron and iron stays a genuine prison poster n
the blows from the butt end of the gun made the house tremble but did not shake the door
nevertheless it is probable that the inhabitants were disturbed for a tiny square window was finally seen to open on the third story and at this aperture appeared the reverend and terrified face of an day haired old man who was the porter and who held a candle
the man who was knocking paused
gentlemen said the porter what do you want
open
said fanuc
that can not be gentlemen
open nevertheless
impossible gentlemen
lec a bus took his gun and aimed at the porter but as he was below and as it was very dark the porter did not see him
will you open yes or no
no gentlemen
do you say no
i say no my boo the porter did not finish
the shot was fired the ball entered under his chin and came out at the nape of his neck after traversing the jugular vein
the old man fell back without a sigh
the candle fell and was extinguished and nothing more was to be seen except a motionless head lying on the soil of the small window and a little whitish smoke which floated off towards the roof
there
said less bus dropping the butt end of his gun to the pavement
he had hardly uttered this word when he felt a hand laid on his shoulder with the weight of an eagle's talon and he heard a voice saying to him on your knees
the murderer turned round and saw before time by olga's's old white face
enjoi rss held a pistol in his hand
he had hastened up at the sound of the discharge
he had seized can uc's collar blouse shirt and suspended with his left hand
on your knees
he repeated
and with an imperious motion the trail young man of twenty years beng the thick set and sturdy porter like a reed and brought him to his knees in the more
less bus attempted to resist but he seemed to have been seized by a superhuman hand
any old as pale with bare neck and dishevelled hair and his woman's face had about him at that moment something of the antique them is
his dilated nostrils his downcast eyes have to his implacable greek profile that expression of wrath and that expression of chastity which as the ancient world viewed the matter be fit justice
the whole barricade hastened up the ball ranged themselves in a circle at a distance feeling that it was impossible to utter a word in the presence of the thing which they were about to be mold
lec a bus vanquished no longer tried to struggle and trembled in every limb
enjoi rss released him and drew out his watch
collect yourself said he
think of pray
you have one minute
merch
murmured the murderer then he dropped his head and stammered a few inarticulate paths
enjoi rss never took his eyes off of him he allowed a minute to pass then he replaced his watch in his fob
that done he grasped less buffy the hair as the latter coiled himself into a ball at his knees and shrieked and placed the muzzle of the pistol to hide at
many of those intrepid men who had so tranquilly entered upon the most terrible of adventures turned aside their heads
an explosion was heard the assassin fell to the pavement fact downwards
enjoi rss straightened himself up and cast a convinced and severe glance around him
then he spurred the corpse with his foot and said throw that outside
three men raised the body of the unhappy wretch which was still agitated by the last mechanical convulsions of the life that has fled and flung it over the little barricade into the rue monde tour
enjoi gas was thoughtful
it is impossible to say what grandiose shadows slowly spread over his bed out table serenity
all at once he raised his voice
a silence fell upon them
citizens said enjoi rac what that man did is frightful what i have done is horrible
he killed therefore i killed him
i had to do it because insurrection must have its discipline
assassination is even more of a crime here than elsewhere we are under the eyes of the revolution we are the priests of the republic we are the victims of duty and must not be possible to slander our combat
i have therefore tried that men and condemned him to death
as for myself constrained as i am to do what i have done and get an hosting if i have judged myself also and you shall soon see to what i have condemned myself
those who listened to him shuddered
we will share thy date cried combe ferre
so be it replied enjoi rss
one word more
in executing this man i have obeyed necessity but necessity is a monster of the old world necessity's name is fatality
now the law of progress is that monsters shall disappear before the angels and that fatality shall danish before fraternity
it is a bad moment to pronounce the word love
no matter i do pronounce it
and i glorify in
love the future is thine
death i make use of thee but i hate thee
citizens in the future there will be neither darkness not thunderbolts neither ferocious ignorance not bloody retaliation
as there will be no more satan there will be no more michael
in the future noone will mill anyone else the earth will be am with radiance the human race will live
the day will come citizens when all will be concord harmony light joy and lift it will come and it is in order that it may come that we are about to die
em hold assessed
his virgin lips closed and he remained for some time standing on the spot where he had shed blood in marble immobility
his staring eye caused those about him to speak in low tones
jean proud wire and comb ever repressed each other's hands silently and leaning against each other in an angle of the barricade they watched with an admiration in which there was some compassion that brave young man executioner and priest composed of light like crystal and also of rock
let us say at once that later on after the action when the bodies were taken to the morgue and searched a police agent's card was found in less bus
the author of this book had in his hands in the special report on this subject made to the prefect of police in
we will add that if we are to believe a tradition of the police which is at vague but probably well founded led a bug was clashes ous
the fact oct gay dating from the death of less bus there was no longer any question of clashes ous
clashes ous had nowhere left any trace of his disappearance he would seem to have amalgamated himself with the invisible
his life had been all shadows his end was night
the whole insurgent group was still under the influence of the emotion of that tragic case which had been so quickly tried and so quickly terminated when court eyes c again be held on the barricade the small young man who had inquired of him that morning for marius
this lad who had a bold and reckless aug had come by night to join the insurgents
book thirteenth
marius enters the shadow chapter i. from the fuel in key to the quartier saint denis the voice which had summoned marius through the twilight to the barricade of the rue de la chambre die had produced on him the effect of the voice of destiny
he wished to die the opportunity presented itself he knocked at the door of the tomb a hand in the darkness offered him the key
these melancholy openings which take place in the gloom before despair are remoting
marius thrust aside the bar which had so often allowed him to pass emerged from the garden and said i will go
mad with grief no longer conscious of anything fixed or solid in his brain incapable of accepting anything thence worth of fate after those two months passed in the intoxication of youth and love overwhelmed at once by all the reveries of despair he had but one desire remaining to make a speedy end of all
he set out at rapid pace
he found himself most opportune it armed as he had javert's pistols with him
the young man of whom he thought that he had caught a glimpse had vanished from his sight in the street
marius who had emerged from the fuel lumen by the boulevard traversed the esplanade and the bridge of the invalides the champs elysees the place louis xv
and reached the rue de rivoli
the x hold were open the're the gas was burning under the arcades women were making their purchases in the stalls people were eating i cds in the cafe lauter and nibbling small cakes at the english pastry cook's shop
only a few posting chaises were setting out at a gallop from the hotel des princes and the hotel meurice
marius entered the rue saint honore through the passage delorme
there the shops were closed the merchants were chatting in front of their half open doors people were walking about the street lanterns were lighted beginning with the first floor all the windows were lighted as usual
there was cavalry on the place du palais royal
marius followed the rue saint honore
in proportion as he left the palais royal behind him there were fewer lighted windows the shops were facts but no one was chatting on the thresholds the street grew sombre and at the same time the crowd increased in density
for the passers by now amounted to a crowd
no one could be seen to speak in this throng and yet there arose from it a dull deep murmur
near the fountain of the arbre des there were assemblages motionless and gloomy groups which were to those who went and came as stones in the midst of running water
at the entrance to the rue des proud aires the crowd no longer walker
it formed a resisting massive solid compact almost impenetrable block of people who were huddled together and conversing in low tones
there were hardly any black costs or round hats now but shock frocks blouses caps and bristling and cadaver ous heads
this multitude undulated confusedly in the nocturnal gloom
it's whisperings had the hoarse accent of a vibration
although not one of them was walking a full trampling was audible in the more
beyond this sense portion of the throng in the rue du roi is in the rue des proud aires and in the extension of the rue saint honore there was no longer a single window in which a candle was burning
only the solitary and diminishing rows of lanterns could be seen vanishing into the street in the distance
the lanterns of that date resembled large red state hanging to ropes and shed upon the pavement a shadow which had the form of a huge slider
these streets were not deserted
there could be descried piles of guns moving bayonets and troops bivouac king
no curious observer passed that limit
the recirculation ceased
there the rabble ended and the army began
marius willed with the will of a man who hopes no more
he had been summoned he must go
he found a means to traverse the throng and to pass the bivouac of the troops be shunned the patrol she avoided the sentinels
he made a circuit reached the rue de get his hand directed his course towards the halles
at the corner of the rue des bourdon mais there were no longer anti and eggs
after having passed the zone of the crowd he had passed the limits of the troops he found himself in something startling
there was no longer a passerby no longer a soldier no longer a light there was no one solitude silence night i know not what chill which seized hold upon one
entering a street was like entering a cellar
he continued to advance
he took a few steps
someone passed close to him at a run
was it a man
or a woman
we're there many of them
he could not have told
it had passed and vanished
proceeding from circuit to circuit he reached a land which he judged to be the rue de la poterie near the middle of this street he came in contact with an obstacle
he extended his hands
it was an overturned way of his foot recognized pools of water gullies and paving stones scattered and piled up
a barricade has been begun there and abandoned
he climbed over the stones and found himself on the other side of the barrier
he walked very near the street posts and guided himself along the walls of the houses
a little beyond the barricade it seemed to him that he could make out something white in front of him
he approached it took on a form
it was two white horses the horses of the omnibus harnessed by bosquet in the morning who had been straying at random all day from street to street and had finally halted there with the weary patience of brutes who no more understand the actions of men than man understands the actions of providence
marius left the horses behind him
as he was approaching a street which seemed to him to be the rue du contrat social a shot coming no one knows whence and traversing the darkness at random whistled close by him and the null by pierced a brass chafing dish suspended above his head over a hairdresser's shop
this pierced chafing dish was still to be seen in in the rue du contrat social at the corner of the pillars of the market
this shot still be told her life
from that instant forth he encountered nothing more
the whole of this itinerary resembled a descent of black steps
nevertheless marius pressed forward
chapter ii an owl's view of paris ageing who could have hovered over paris that night with the wing of the bat or the owl would have had beneath his eyes a gloomy spectacle
all that old quarter of the halles which is like a city within a city through which run the eyes saint denis and saint martin where a thousand pages cross end of which the insurgents had made their redoubt and their stronghold would have appeared to him like a dark and enormous cavity hollowed out in the centre of paris
there the glance fell into an abyss
thanks to the broken lanterns thanks to the closed windows there all radiance all life all sound all movement ceased
the invisible police of the insurrection were on the watch everywhere and main tained order that is to say night
the necessary tactics of insurrection are to drown small numbers in a vast obscurity to multiply every combatant by the possibilities which that obscurity contains
at dusk every window where a candle was burning received a shot
the light was extinguished sometimes the inhabitants a skilled
hence not hint was stirring
there was nothing but bright mourning stupor in the houses and in the streets a sort of sacred horror
not even the long rows of windows and stores the indentations of the chimneys and the goods and the vague reflections which are cashback by the web and muddy pavements were visible
an eye cast upward at that mass of shadows might perhaps have caught a glimpse here and the year intervals of indistinct gleams which brought out broken and eccentric lines and profiles of singular buildings something like the lights which go and come in ruins it was at such points that the barricades were situated
the rest was a lake of obscurity foggy heavy and funereal above which in motionless and melancholy outlines rose the tower of saint jacques the church of saint merry and two or three more of those grand edifices of which man makes giants and the night makes phantoms
all around this deserted and disquieting labyrinth in the quarters where the parisian circulation had not been annihilated and where are a street lanterns still burned the aerial observer might have distinguished the metallic gleam of swords and bayonets the full rumble of artillery and the swarming of silent battalions whose ranks were swelling from minute to minutes formidable girdle which was slowly drawing in and around the insurrection
the invested quarter was no longer anything more than a monstrous cavern everything there appeared to be asleep or motionless and as we have just seen any street which one might come to offered nothing but darkness
a wild darkness full of traps full of unseen and formidable shocks into which it was alarming to penetrate and in which it was terrible to remain where those who entered shivered before those whom they awaited where those who waited shuddered before those who were coming
invisible combatants were entrenched at every corner of the street shares of the sepulchre concealed in the density of night
all was over
no more light was to be hoped for henceforth except the lightning of guns no further encounter except the abrupt and rapid apparition of death
where
how
when
no one knew but it was certain and inevitable
in this place which had been marked out for the struggle the government and the insurrection the national guard and popular societies the bourgeois and the up to sing groping their way we're about to come into contact
the necessity was the same for both
the only possible issue thenceforth was to emerge thence killed or conquerors
a situation so extreme an obscurity so powerful that the most timid felt themselves seized with resolution and the most daring with terror
moreover on both sides the fury the rage and the determination were equal
for the one party to advance meant death and no one dreamed of retreating for the other to remain meant death and no one dreamed of flight
it was indispensable that all should be ended on the following day that triumph should rest either here or there that the insurrection should prove itself a revolution or a skirmish
the government understood this as well as the parties the most insignificant bourgeois felt it
hence a thought of anguish which mingled with the impenetrable gloom of this quarter where all was at the point of being decided hence are doubled anxiety around that silence whence a catastrophe was on the point of emerging
here only one sound was audible a sound as heartrending as the death rattle as menacing as a male fiction the toc son of saint merry
nothing could be more blood curdling than the clamor of that wild and desperate bell sailing amid the shadows
as it often happens nature seemed to have fallen into accord with what men were about to do
nothing disturbed the harmony of the whole effect
the stars had disappeared heavy clouds filled the horizon with their melancholy folds
a black sky rested on these dead streets as though an immense winding sheet were being out spread over this immense tomb
while a battle that was still wholly political was in preparation of the same locality which had already witnessed so many revolutionary events while youth the secret associations the schools in the name of principles and the middle classes in the name of interests were approaching preparatory to dashing themselves together clasping and throwing each other while each one hastened and invited the last and decisive hour of the crisis far away and quite outside of this fatal quarter in the most profound depths of the unfathomable cavities of that wretched old paris which disappears under the splendor of happy and opulent paris the sombre voice of the people could be heard giving utterance to a full road
a fearful and sacred voice which is composed of the roar of the brute and of the word of god which terrified the weak and which warns the wise which comes both from below like the voice of the lion and from on high like the voice of the thunder
chapter iii the extreme edge marius had reached the halles
there everything was still calmer more obscure and more motion less than in the neighboring streets
one would have said that the glacial peace of the sepulchre had sprung forth from the earth and had spread over the heavens
nevertheless a red glow brought out against this black background the lofty roots of the houses which barred the rue de la chambre die on the saint eustache side
it was the reflection of the torch which was turning in the air in the barricade
marius directed his steps towards that red light
it had drawn him to the march eaux pourers and he caught a glimpse of the dark mouth of the rue des pres heure
he entered it
the insurgents' sentinel who was guarding the other end did not see him
he felt that he was very close to that which he had come in search of and he walked on tiptoe
in this manner he reached the elbow of that short section of the rue monde tour which was as the reader will remember the only communication which enjoi rashad preserved with the outside world
at the corner of the last house on his left he thrust his head forward and looked into the fragment of the rue monde tour
a little beyond the angle of the land and the eye de lacy and eerie which case abroad curtain of shadow in which he was himself engulfed he perceived some light on the pavement a bit of the wine shop and beyond a flickering lamp within a sort of shapeless wall and men crouching down with guns on their knees
all this waste heat home distant from him
it was the interior of the barricade
the houses which bordered the land on the right concealed the rest of the wine shop the large barricade and the flag from him
marius had but a step more to take
then the unhappy young man seated himself on a post folded his arms and fell to thinking about his father
he thought of that heroic colonel pont mercy who had been so proud a soldier who had guarded the frontier of france under the republicans had touched the frontier of asia under napoleon who had be held genoa alexandria milan turin madrid vienna dresden berlin moscow who had left on all the victorious battlefields of europe drops of that same blood which he had just as in his veins who had grown gray before his time in discipline and command who had lived with his sword belt buckles his epaulets falling on his breast his cock are blackened with powder his brow furrowed with his helmet in barracks in camp in the bivouac in ambulances and who at the expiration of twenty years had returned from the great wars with a scarred check a smiling countenance tranquil admirable pure as a child having done everything for france and nothing against her
he said to himself that his day has also come now that his hour had struck that following his father he too was about to show himself brave intrepid bold to run to meet the bullets to offer his breast to bayonets to shed his blood to seek the enemy to seek death that he was about to wage war in his turn and descend to the field of battle and that the field of battle upon which he was to descend was the street and that the war in which he was about to engage was civil war
he beheld civil war laid open like a gulf before him and into this he was about to fall
then he shuddered
he thought of his father's sword which his grandfather had sold to a second hand dealer and which he had so mournfully regretted
he said to himself that that chaste and valiant sword had done well to escape from him and to depart in wrath into the gloom that if it had thus fled it was because it was intelligent and because it had foreseen the future that it had had a presentiment of this rebellion the war on the gutters the war of the pavements fusillade's through cellar windows blow a given and received in the rear it was because coming from marengo and friedland it did not wish to go to the rue de la change erie it was because after what it had done with the father it did not wish to do this for the son
he told himself that if that's words are there if after taking possession of it at his father's pillow he had dared to take it and carry it off for this combat of darkness between frenchmen in the streets it would assuredly have scorched his hands and burst out a flame before his eyes like the sword of the angel
he told himself that it was fortunate that it was not there and that it had disappeared that that was well that that was just that his grandfather had been the true guardian of his father's glory and that it was far better that the colonel's sword should be sold at auction sold to the old clothes man thrown among the old junk than that it should today wound the side of his country
and then he fell to weeping bitterly
this was horrible
but what wash stock
live without cosette he could not
since she was gone he must needs die
had he not given her his word of honor that he would die
she had gone knowing that this meant that it pleased her that marius should die
and then it was clear that she no longer loved him since she had departed this without warning without a word without a letter although she knew his address
what was the good of living and why should be live now
and then what
should be retreat after going so far
should be flee from danger after having approached it
should be slip away after having come and peeped into the barricade
slip away all in a tremble saying after all i have had enough of it as it is
i have seen it that suffices this is civil war and i shall take my leave
should be abandon his friends who were expecting him
who were in need of him possibly
who were a mere handful against an army
ahlul she be untrue at once to his love to country to his word
should he give to his cowardice the pretext of patriotism
but this was impossible and is the phantom of his father was there in the gloom and beheld him retreating he would beat him on the loins with the flag of his sword and shout to him march on you poly room
thus a prey to the conflicting movements of his thought she dropped his head
all at once he raised it
a sort of splendid rectification had just been effected in his mind
there is a widening of the sphere of thought which is peculiar to the vicinity of the grave it makes one see clearly to be near death
the vision of the action into which he felt that he was perhaps on the point of entering appeared to him no more as lamentable but as superb
the war of the street was suddenly transfigured by some unfathomable inwards of king of his soul before the eye of his thought
all the tumultuous interrogation points off every recurred to him in throngs but without troubling him
he left none of them unanswered
let us see why should his father be indignant
are there not cases where insurrection rises to the dignity of duty
what was there that was degrading for the son of colonel pont mercy in the combat which was about to begin
it is no longer month i rail for champ aubert it is something quite different
the question is no longer one of sacred territory but of a holy idea
the country walls that may be but humanity applauds
but is it true that the country does wall
france bleeds but liberty smiles and in the presence of liberty's smile france for gets her wound
and then if we look at things from a still more lofty point of view why do we speak of civil war
civil war what does that mean
is there a foreign war
is not all war between men war between brothers
war is qualified only by its object
there is no such thing as foreign or civil war there is only just and unjust war
until that day when the grand human agreement is concluded war that at least which is the effort of the future which is hastening on against the past which is lagging in the rear may be necessary
what have we to reproach that war with
war does not become a disgrace the sword does not become a disgrace except when it is used for assassinating the right progress reason civilization truth
the near whether foreign or civil is iniquitous it is called crime
outside the pale of that holy thing justice by what right does one form of man despise another
by what right should the sword of washington disown the pile of camille des moulins
leonidas against the stranger timoleon against the tyrant which is the greater
the one is the defender the other the liberator
shall we brand every appeal to arms within a city's limits without taking the object into a consideration
then note the infamy of brutus marcel arnould don box blenheim coligny hedgerow war

down with the tyrant
of whom are you speaking
do you call louis philippe the tyrant
no no more than louis xvi
both of them are what history is in the habit of calling good kings but principles are not to be parcel led out the logic of the true is rectilinear the peculiarity of truth is that it lacks com plaisance no concessions then all encroachments on man should be repressed
there is a divine right in louis xvi
there is because a bourbon in louis philippe both represent in a certain measure the confiscation of right and in order to clear away universal insurrection they must be combated it must be done france being always the one to begin
when the master falls in france he falls everywhere
in short what cause is more just and consequently what war is greater than that which reestablished social truth restores her throne to liberty restores the people to the people restores sovereignty to man replaces the purple on the head of france restores equity and reason in their plenitude suppresses every term of antagonism by restoring each one to himself annihilated the obstacle which royalty presents to the whole immense universal concord and places the human race once more on a level with the right
these wars build up peace

logic is mingled with convulsion and the thread of the syllogism floats without breaking in the mournful storm of thought
this was the situation of marius' mind
asus meditated this rejected but resolute hesitating in every direction and in short shuddering at what he was about to do his glance strayed to the interior of the barricade
the insurgents were here conversing in a low voice without moving and there was perceptible that quasi silence which marks the last stage of expectation
overhead at the small window in the third story marius descried a sort of spectator who appeared to him to be singularly attentive
this was the porter who had been killed by less bus
below by the lights of the torch which was thrust between the paving stones this year could be vaguely distinguished
nothing could be stranger in that sombre and uncertain gleam than that livid motionless astonished face with its bristling hair its eyes fixed and sharing and its yawning mouth bent over the street in an attitude of curiosity
one would have said that the man who was dead was surveying those who were about to die
a long trail of blood which had flowed from that head descended in reddish threads from the window to the height of the first floor where it shipped

they no longer addressed each other they listened seeking to catch even the faintest and most distant sound of marching
suddenly in the midst of the dismal calm a clear gay young voice which seemed to come from the rue saint denis dose and began to sing distinctly to the old popular air or by the light of the moon this bit of poetry terminated by a cry like the crow of a sock mon near st. enlarge am on a minute aud pret empires gendarmes pour leur fire in hot

a hasty rush troubled the deserted street they beheld a being more agile that a clown climb over the omnibus and gave if he bounced into the barricades'll breathless saying my gun

an electric quiver shot through the whole barricade and the sound of hands seeking their guns became audible
would you like my carbine

i want a big gun replied had roche
and he seized have rt's gun
two sentinels had fallen back and had come in almost at the same moment as bad roche
they were the sentinels from the end of the street and the vidette of the rue de la petite try and erie
the vidette of the land des pres heirs had remained at his post which indicated that nothing was approaching from the direction of the bridges and halles
the rue de la chambre rid of which a few paving stones alone were dimly visible in the reflection of the light projected on the flag offered to the insurgents the aspect of a cast black door vaguely opened into a smoke
each man had taken up his position for the conflict
forty three insurgents among whom were enjo orascom be ferre source trac bossier holy bw hotel and gave of beware kneeling inside the large barricade with their heads on a level with the crest of the barrier the barrels of their guns and carbines aimed on the stones as though at loopholes attentive mute ready to fire
six commanded by f chilly had installed themselves with their guns levelled at their shoulders at the windows of the two stories of corinth e
several minutes passed this then a sound of footsteps measured heavy and numerous became distinctly audible in the direction of saint leu
this sound faint at first then precise then heavy and sonorous approached slowly without half without intermission with a tranquil and terrible continuity
nothing was to be heard but this
it was that combined silence and sound of the statue of the commander but this stony step had something indescribably enormous and multiple about it which awakened the idea of a throng and at the same time the idea of a spectre
one thought one heard the terrible status legion marching onward
this tread drew near it drew still nearer and stopped
it seemed as though the breathing of many men could be heard at the end of the street
nothing was to be seen however but at the bottom of that sense obscurity there could be distinguished a multitude of metallic threads as fine as needles and almost imperceptible which moved about like those indescribable phosphoric networks which one sees beneath one's closed eyelids in the first mists of slumber at the moment when one is dropping off to sleep
these were bayonets and gun barrels confusedly illuminated by the distant reflection of the torch
a pause ensued as though both sides were waiting
all at once from the depths of this darkness a voice which was all the more sinister since no one was visible and which appeared to be the gloom itself speak img shouted who goes there
at the same time the click of guns as they were lowered into position was heard
enjoi rss replied in a haughty and vibrating to be the french revolution

shouted the voice
a flash em purple call the facades in the street as though the door of a furnace had been flung open and hastily closed again
a fearful detonation burst forth on the barricade
the red flag fell
the discharge had been so violent and so dense that it had cut the staff that is to say the very top of the omnibus pole
bullets which has rebounded from the cornices of the houses penetrated the barricade and wounded several men
the impression produced by this first discharge was freezing
the attack had been rough and of a nature to inspire reflection in the boldest
it was evident that they had to deal with an entire refine mt at the very least
comrades

let us wait until they are in the street before replying

not a man responded
to mount on the barricade at the very moment when without any doubt it was again the object of their aim was simply death
the bravest hesitated to pronounce his own condemnation

he repeated does no one volunteer

there he had so to speak retreated into himself
he no longer seemed to look or to think
four be trac and others had accosted him two or three times warning him of his peril beseeching him to withdraw but he did not hear them
when they were not speaking to him his mouth moved as though he were replying to someone and as soon as he was addressed his lips became motionless and his eyes no longer had the appearance of being alive
several hours before the barricade was amy acker he had assumed an attitude which he did not afterwards abandon with both fists planted on his knees and his head thrust forward as though he were gazing over a precipice
nothing had been able to move him from this attitude it did not seen as though his mind were in the barricade
when each had gone to take up his position for the combat there remained in the tap room where javert was found to the post only a single insurgent with a naked sword watching over javert and himself man eur
at the moment of the attack at the detonation the physical shock had reached him and had as it were awakened him he started up abruptly crossed the room and at the instant when en joke as repeated his appeal does no one volunteer
the old man was seen to make his appearance on the threshold of the wine shop
his presence produced a sort of commotion in the different groups
a shout went up it is the voter
it is the member of the convention
it is the representative of the people
it is probable that he did not hear them
he strode straight up to em hold as the insurgents withdrawing before him with a religious fear before the flag from en no less quote coiled in amazement and then since no one dared to stop or to assist him this old man of eighty with shaking head but firm foot began slowly to ascend the staircase of paving stones arranged in the barricade
this was so melancholy and so grand that all around him dried off with your hats
at every step that he mounted it was a frightful spectacle his white picks his decrepit face his lofty bald and wrinkled brown is amazed and open mouth his age dark upholding the red banner rose through the gloom and were enlarged in the bloody light of the torch and the bystanders thought that they beheld the spectra of' emerging from the earth with the flag of terror in his hand
when he had reached the last step when this trembling and terrible phantom erect in that pile of rubbish in the presence of twelve hundred invisible guns drew himself up in the face of death and as though he were more powerful than it the whole barricade assumed amid the darkness a supernatural and colossal form
there ensued one of those silences which occur only in the presence of prodigies
in the midst of this silence the old man waved the red flag and shouted long live the revolution
long live the republic
fraternity
equality
and death
those in the barricade heard a low and rapid whisper like the murmur of a priest who is despatching a prayer in haste
it was probably the commissary of police who was making the legal summons at the other end of the street
then the same piercing voice which had shouted who goes there
shouted retire
m
have it pale haggard his eyes lighted up with the mournful flame of aberration raised the flag above his head and repeated long live the republic

said the voice
a second discharge similar to the first rained down upon the barricade
the old man fell on his knees then rose again dropped the flag and fell backwards on the pavement like a lot at full length with outstretched arms
rivulets of blood flowed beneath him
his and the ad pale and sad seemed to be gazing at the sky
one of those emotions which are superior to man which make him forget even to defend himself seized upon the insurgents and they approached the body with respect cu laws

a murmur of gloomy and energetic ascent followed these words

six men made a litter of their guns on this they laid the body and bore it with bated heads with solemn slowness to the large table in the tap room
these men wholly absorbed in the grave and sacred task on which they were engaged thought no more of the perilous situation in which they stood

all at once he shouted lookout

it was almost too late
they saw a glistening density of bayonets undulating above the barricade
municipal guards of lofty stature were making their way in some striding over the omnibus others through the cut thrusting before them the urchins hire treated but did not flee
the moment was critical
it was that first redoubtable moment of inundation when the stream rises to the level of the levee and when the water begins to filter through the fissures of wine

the largest of all a sort of colossus marched on nav roche with his bayonet fixed
the urchin took in his arms javert's immense gun levelled it resolutely at the giant and fired
no discharge followed
javert's gun was not loaded
the municipal guard burst into a laugh and raised his bayonet at the child
before the bayonet had touched had roche the gun slipped from the soldier's grasp a bullet had struck the municipal guardsman in the centre of the forehead and he fell over on his back
a second bullet struck the other guard who had assaulted source trac in the breast and laid him low on the pavement
this was the work of marius who had just entered the barricade
chapter iv the barrel of powder marius still concealed in the turn of the rue monde your had witnessed shuddering and irresolute the first phase of the combat

of that child threatened of his friends to succor or to avenge all hesitation had vanished and he had flung himself into the conflict his two pistols in hand
with his first shot he had saved gev roche and with the second delivered cour de trac
amid the sound of the shots amid the cries of the assaulted guards the assailants had climbed the entrenchment on whose summit municipal guards soldiers of the line and national guards from the suburbs could now be seen tuning and reading themselves to more than half the height of their bodies
they already covered more than two thirds of the barrier but they did not leap into the enclosure as though wavering in the fear of some trap
they gazed into the dark barricade as one would fade into a lion's den
the light of the torch illuminated only their bayonets their bearskin caps and the upper part of their uneasy and angry faces
marius had no longer any weapons he had flung away his discharged pistols after firing them but he had caught sight of the barrel of powder in the tap room near the door
as he turned half round gazing in that direction a soldier took aim at him
at the moment when the soldier was sighting marius a hand was laid on the muzzle of the gun and obstructed it
this was done by someone who had'd agree forward the young workman in velvet trousers
the shots per traversed the hand and possibly also the workman since he fell but the ball did not strike marius
all this which was rather to be apprehended than seen through the smoke marius who was entering the tap room hardly noticed
still he had in a confused way perceived that gun barrel aimed at him and the hand which had blocked it and he had heard the discharge
but in moments like thus the things which one sees vacillate and are precipitated and one pauses for nothing
one feels obscurely impelled towards more darkness still and all is cloud
the insurgents surprised but not terrified had rallied
engl iraq had shouted wait
don't fire at random
in the first confusion they might in fact wound each other
the majority of them had ascended to the window on the first story and to the attic windows whence they commanded the assailants
the most determined with em hold a scourge tracks am proud wire and combed free had proudly placed themselves with their backs against the houses at the rear in sheltered and facing the ranks of soldiers and guards who crowned the barricade
all this was accomplished without haste with that dt range and threatening gravity which precedes engagements

they do discharges took place at the same moment and all disappeared in smoke
w madrid and stifling smoke in which dying and wounded lay with weak full groans
when the smoke cleared away the combatants in both sides could be seen to be thinned out but still in the same positions reloading in silence
all at once a thundering voice was heard shouting be off with you or i'll blow to the barricade
all turned in the direction whence the voice proceeded
marius had entered the tap room and had seized the barrel of powder then he had taken advantage of the smoke and the sort of obscure most which filled the entrenched enclosure to glide along the barricade as far as that care of paving stones where the torch was fixed
to hear it from the torch to replace it by the barrel of powder to thrust the pile of stones under the barrel which was instantly shaved in with a sort of horrible obedience all this had cost marius but the time necessary to stoop and rise again and now all national guard's municipal guards officers soldiers huddled at the other extremity of the barricade based stupidly at him as he stood with his foot on the stones his torch in his hand his naughty fact illuminated by a fatal resolution dropping the flame of the torch towards that redoubtable pile where they could take out the broken barrel of powder and giving vent to that startling cry be off with you or i'll blow up the barricade
marius of that barricade after the octogenarian was the vision of the young revolution after the apparition of the old
blow up the barricade
said a sergeant and yourself with it
marius retorted and myself also
and he dropped the torch towards the barrel of powder
but there was no longer anyone on the barrier
the assailants abandoning their dead and wounded closed back pell hell and in disorder towards the extremity of the street and there were again lost in the night

marius had already seen too much of life not to know that nothing is more imminent than the impossible and that what it is always necessary to foresee is the unforeseen
he had looked on at his own drama as a piece which one does not understand
in the mists which envelopes his thought she did not recognize javert who bound to his post has not so much as moved his head during the whole of the attack on the barricade and who had gazed on the revolt seething around him with the resignation of a martyr and the majesty of a judge
marius had not even seen him
in the meanwhile the assailants did not stir they could be heard marching and swarming through at the end of the street but they did not venture into it either because they were awaiting orders or because they were awaiting reinforcements before hurling themselves a fresh on this impregnable redoubt
the insurgents has posted sentinels and some of them who were medical students set about caring for the wounded
they had thrown the tables out of the wine shop with the exception of the two tables reserved for long and cartridges and of the one on which lays a thermage if they had added them to the barricade and had replaced them in the tap room with mattresses from the bed of the widow his hell up and her servants
on these mattresses they had laid the wounded
as for the three poor creatures who inhabited for in the no one knew what had become of them
they were finally found however hidden in the cellar
a poignant emotion clouded the joy of thesis encumbered barricade
the roll was called
one of the insur yr mts was missing

he was sought among the wounded he was not there
he was sought among the dead he was not there
he was evidently a prisoner
comber free said town hold as they have our friend we have their agent

yes replied enjoi rss but less dothan on the life of jean proud aire
this took place in the tap room near javert's post

listen's side by olga's laying his hand on combe ferre's arm
at the end of the street there was a significant clash of arms
they heard a manly voice about vive la france
long live france

they recognized the voice of proud aire
a flash passed a report rang out
silence fell again
they have killed him exclaimed combe ferre

chapter vi the agony of death after the agony of life a peculiarity of this species of war is that the attack of the barricades is almost always made from the front and that the assailants generally abstain from turning the position either because they fear ambushes or because they are afraid of getting entangled in the tortuous streets
the insurgents' whole attention has been directed therefore to the grand barricade which was evidently the spot always menaced and there the struggle would infallibly recommends
but marius thought of the little barricade and went thither
it was deserted and guarded only by the fire pit which trembled between the paving stones
moreover them once your alley and the branches of the rue de la petite try and erie and the rue du cygne were profoundly calm
as marius was withdrawing after concluding his inspection he heard his name pronounced feebly in the darkness
monsieur marius
he started for he recognized the voice which had called to him two hours before through the gate in the rue plumer
only the voice now seemed to be nothing more than a breath
he looked about him but saw no one
marius thought he had been mistaken that it was an illusion added by his mind to the extraordinary realities which were flashing around him
he advanced a step in order to quit the distant recess where the barricade lay
monsieur marius
repeated the voice
this time he could not doubt that he had heard it distinctly he looked and saw nothing
at your feet said the voice
he bent down and saw in the darkness a form which was dragging itself towards him
it was crawling along the pavement
it was this that had spoken to him
the fire pit allowed him to distinguish a blouse torn trousers of coarse velvet bare feet and something which resembled a pool of blood
marius indistinctly made out a pale head which was lifted to wards him and which was saying to him you do not recognise me
no
epo none
marine bent hastily down
it was in fact that unhappy child
she was dressed in men's clothes
how come you here
what are you doing here
i am dying said she
there are words and incidents which aroused ejected beings
marius cried out with a start you are rounded
wait i will carry you into the room
they will attend to you there
i sit serious
how much i take hold of you in order not to hurt you
where do you suffer
help
my god
but why did you come hither
and he tried to pass his arm under her in order to raise her
she uttered a feeble cru
have i hurt you
asked marius
a little
but i only touched your hand
she raised her hand to marius and in the middle of that hand marius saw a black hole
what is the matter with your hand
said he
it is pierced
pierced
yes
what with
a bullet
how
did you see a gun aimed at you
yes and a hand stopping it
it was mine
marius was seized with a shudder
what madness
poor child
but so much the better if that is all it is nothing let me carry you to a bed
they will dress your wound one does not die of a pierced hand
she murmured the bullet traversed my hand but it came out through my back
it is useless to remove me from this spot
i will tell you how you can care for me better than any surgeon
sit down near me on this stone
he obeyed she laid her head in marius' knees and without looking at him she said on
how good this is
how comfortable this is
there i no longer suffer
she remained silent for a moment then she turned her face with an effort and looked at marius
do you know what monsieur marius
it puzzled me because you entered that garden it was stupid because it was i who showed you that house and then i ought to have said to myself that a young man like you she paused and overstepping the sombre transitions that undoubtedly existed in her mind she resumed with a heartrending smile you though the uglydidn't you
she continued you see you are lost
now no one can get out of the barricade
it was is hoped you hereby the way
you are going to disk count upon that
and yet when i saw them taking aim at you i put my hand on the muzzle of the gun
how queer it is
but it was because i wanted to die before you
when i received that bullet i dragged myself here no one saw me no one picked me up i was waiting for you usaid's one is not coming
' oh if you only knew
i got my blouse i suffered so
now i am well
do you remember the day i entered your chamber and when i looked at myself in your mirror and the day when i came to you on the boulevard near the washer women
how the birds sang
that was a long time ago
you gave me a hundred sous and i said to you' idon't want your money
' i hope you picked up your coin
you are not rich
i did not think to tell you to pick it up
the sun was shining bright and it was not cold
do you remember monsieur marius
oh
how happy i am
everyone is going to die
she had a max grave and heartbreaking air
her torn blouse disclosed her bare throat
as she talked she pressed her pierced hand to her breast where there was another hole and whence there's ousted from moment to momenta stream of blood like a jet of wine from an open bunghole
marius gazed at this unfortunate creature with profound compassion
oy
she resumed it is coming again i am stifling
she caught up her blouse and buy it and her limbs stiffened on the pavement
at that moment the young cock's crow executed by little bag roche resounded through the barricade
the child had mounted at able to load his gun and was singing gayly the song then so popular envoy any lafayette on beholding lafayette legends there pete the gendarme repeats said one nous
as icons nous
let us flee
let us flee
salvo famous
let us flee
epo nine raised herself and listened then she murmured it is he
and turning to marius my brother is here
he must not see me
he would scold me
your brother
inquired marius who was meditating in the most bitter and sorrowful depths of his heart on the duties to the the barriers which his father had bequeathed to him who is your brother
that little fellow
the one who is singing
yes
marius have a movement
oh
don't go away said she it will not belong now
she was sitting so just upright but her voice was very low and broken by his coughs
at intervals the death rattle interrupted her
she put her face as near that of marius as possible
she added with a strange expression listen i do not wish to play you at risk
i have a letter in my pocket for you
i was told to put it in the post
i kept it
i did not want to have it reach you
but perhaps you will be angry with me for it when we meet again presently
take your letter
she grasped marius' hand convulsively with her pierced handguns hs no longer seemed to feel her sufferings
she put marius' hand in the pocket of her blouse
there in fact marius felt a paper
take it said she
marius took the letter
she made a sign of satisfaction and contentment
now for my trouble promise me and she stopped
what
asked markus
promise me
i promise
promise to give me a kiss on hybrid when i am dead
i shall feel it
she dropped her head again on marius' knees and her eyelids closed
he thought the poor soul had departed
epo nine remained motionless
all at once at the very moment when marius fancied he rac keep forever she slowly opened her eyes in which appeared the sombre profundity of death and said to him i had one whose sweetness seemed already to proceed from another world and by the way monsieur marius i believe that i was a little bit in love with you
she tried to smile once more and expired
chapter vii had roche as a profound calculator of distances marius kept his promise
he dropped a kiss on that livid grow where the icy perspiration stood in beads
this was no infidelity to cosette it was a gentle and pensive farewell to an unhappy soup
it was not without a tremor that he had taken the letter which soon one had given him
he had immediately felt that it was an event of weight
he was impatient to read it
the heart of man is so constituted that the unhappy child had hardly closed her eyes when marius began to think of unfolding this paper
he laid her gently on the ground and went away
something told him that he could not peruse that letter in the presence of that body
he drew near to a candle in the tap room
it was a small note folded and sealed with a woman's elegant care
the address was in a woman's hand and ran to monsieur monsieur marius pont mercy atm
cour de urac's rue de la ferrer is no
he broke the seal and read my dearest alas
my father insists on our setting out immediately
we shall be this evening in the rue del' homme arms no
in a week we shall be in england
cosette
june th
such was the innocence of their love that marius was not even acquainted with cosette's handwriting
what had taken place may be related in a few words
epl nine had been the cause of everything
after the evening of the dog june she had cherished a double idea to defeat the projects of her father and the ruffians on the house of the rue plumer and to separate marius and cosette
she had exchanged tags with the first young stamp she came across who had thought it amusing to dress like a woman who keep in one disguises herself like a man
it was she who had conveyed to jean valjean in the champ de mars the expressive warning leave your house
jean valjean had in fact returned home and had said to cosette we set out this evening and we go to the rue del' homme arms with toussaint
next week we shall be in london
cosette utterly overwhelmed by this unexpected blow had hastily penned a couple of lines to marius
but how was due to get the letter to the post
she never went out alone and toussaint surprised at such a commission would certainly show the letter to m
gauche le vent
in this dilemma cosette had caught sight through the fence keep on one in man's clothes who now prowled incessantly around the garden
cosette had called to this young workman and had handed him five france and the letter saying carry this letter immediately to its address
ep on one had put the letter in her pocket
the next day ont meth of june she went to do here urac's quarters to inquire for marius not for the purpose of delivering the letter but a thing which every jealous and living soul will comprehend to see
there she had waited for marius or at least for source trac still for the purpose of seeing
when source trac had told her we are going to the barricades an idea flashed through her mind to flung herself into that death as she would have done into any other end to thrust marius into it also
she had followed source trac had made sure of the locality where the barricade was in process of construction and quite certain since marius had received no warning and since she had intercepted the letter that he would go at dusk to his trust one place for every evening she had be taken herself to the rue plumer had there awaited marius and had sent him in the name of his friends the appeal which would she thought lead him to the barricade
she reckoned on marius' despair when he should fail to find cosette she was not mistaken
she had returned to the rue de la chambre die herself
what she did there the reader has just seem
she died with the tragic joy of jealousy darts who drag the beloved being into their own death and who say no one shall have him
marius covered cosette's letter with kisses
so she loved him
for one moment the idea occurred to him that he ought not to die now
then he said to himself she is going away
her father is taking her to england and my grandfather refuses his consent to the marriage
nothing is changed in our rates
dreamer's like marius are subject to supreme attacks of rejection and desperate resolves are the result
the fatigue of living is insupportable death is sooner over with
then he reflected that he had still two duties to fulfil to inform cosette of his death and send her a final farewell and to save from the impending catastrophe which was in preparation that poor child spinone's brother and the nerdier's son
he had a pocket book about him the same one which had contained the notebook in which he had inscribed so many thoughts of love for cosette
he tore out a leaf and wrote on it a few lines in pencil our marriage was impossible
i asked my grandfather he refused i have no fortune neither hast thou
i hastened to thee thou wert no longer there
thou knowest the promise that i gave thee i shall keep it
i die
i love thee
when thou read dst this my soul will be near the sand thou wilt's mike
having nothing wherewith to seal this letter he contented himself with folding the paper in four and added the address to mademoiselle cosette rauch eleven farm
gauche le vent's rue del' homme arms no
having folded the letter he stood in thought for a moment drew out his pocket book again opened it and wrote with the same pencil these four lines on the first page my name is marius pont mercy
carry my body to my grandfather m
ville normand rue des filles du val val reno
in the marais
he put his pocket book back in his pocket then he called ga crocus
the gs min at the sound of marius' voice ran up to him with his merch and devoted air
will you do something for me
anything said had roche
good god
if it had not been for you i should have been done for
do you see this letter
yes
take it
leave the barricade instantly gave if he began to scratch his ear uneasily and tomorrow morning you will deliver it at its address to mademoiselle cosette atm
gauche le vent's rue del' homme arms no
the heroic child replied well but
in the meanwhile the barricade will be taken and i shall not be there
the barricade will not be attacked until daybreak according to all appearances and will not be taken before tomorrow noon
the fresh despite which the assailants were granting to the barricade had in fact been prolonged
it was one of those intermissions which frequently occur in nocturnal combats which are always followed by an increase of rage
well said had roche what if i were to go and carry your letter tomorrow
it will be too late
the barricade will probably be blockaded all the streets will be guarded and you will not be able to get out
go at once
gav roche could think of no reply to this and stood there in indecision scratching his ear sadly
all at once he took the letter with one of those bird like movements which were common with him
all right said he
and he started off at a run through monde four lane
an idea had occurred to have oche which had brought him to a decision but he had not mentioned it for fear that marius might offer some objection to it
this was the idea it is barely midnight the rue del' homme arms is not far off i will go and deliver the letter at once and i shall get back in time
book fifteenth
the rue del' homme arms chapter is drinker is a babbler what are the convulsions of a city in comparison with the insurrections of the soul
man is a depth still greater than the people
jean valjean at that very moment was the prey of a terrible upheaval
every sort of gulf had opened again within him
he also was trembling like paris on the brink of an obscure and formidable revolution
a few hours had sufficed to bring this about
his destiny and his conscience had suddenly been covered with gloom
of him also as well as of paris it might have been said two principles are fave to face
the white angel and the black angel are about to seize each other on the bridge of the abyss
which of the two will hurl the other over
who will carry the day
on the evening preceding this same th of june jean valjean accompanied by cosette and toussaint had installed himself in the rue del' homme arms
a change awaited him the er
cosette had not quitted the rue plumer without making an effort at resistance
for the first time since they had lived side by side cosette's will and the will of jean valjean had proved to be distinct and had been in opposition at least if they had not clashed
there had been objections on one side and inflexibility on the other
the abrupt advice leave your house hurled at jean valjean by a stranger had alarmed him to the extent of rendering him peremptory
he thought that he had been traced and followed
cosette had been obliged to give way
both had arrived in the rue del' homme arms without opening their lips and without uttering a word each being absorbed in his own personal preoccupation jean valjean so uneasy that he did not notice cosette's sadness cosette so sad that she did not notice jean valjean's uneasiness
jean valjean had taken toussaint with him a thing which he had never done in his previous absences
he perceived the possibility of not returning to the rue plumer and he could neither leave toussaint behind now confide his secret to her
besides he felt that she was devoted and trustworthy
treachery between master and servant begins in curiosity
now toussaint as though she had been destined to be jean valjean's servant was not curious
she stammered in her peasant dialect of bar neville i am made so i do my work the rest is no affair of mine
in this departure from the rue plumer which had been almost a flight jean valjean had carried away nothing but the little embalmed valise baptized by cosette the inseparable
full trunks would have required porters and porters are witnesses
afi acre had been summoned to the door on the rue de babylone and they had taken their departure
it was with difficulty that toussaint had obtained permission to pack up a little linen and clothes and a few toilet articles
rosette had taken only her portfolio and her blogging book
jean valjean with a view to augmenting the solitude and the mystery of this departure had arranged to quit the pavilion of the rue plumer only at dusk which had allowed cosette time to write her note to marius
they had arrived in the rue del' homme arms after night had fully fallen
they had gone to bed in silence
the lodgings in the rue del' homme arms were situated on a backcourt on the second floor and were composed of two sleeping rooms a dining room and a kitchen adjoining the dining room with a garret where there was a folding bed and which fell to toussaint's share
the dining room was an antechamber as well and separated the two bedrooms
the apartment was provided with all necessary utensils
people reacquire confidence as foolishly as they lose it human nature is so constituted
hardly had jean valjean reached the rue del' homme at me when his anxiety was lightened and by degrees dissipated
there are soothing spots which act in some sort mechanically of the mind
an obscure street peaceable inhabitants
jean valjean experienced an indescribable contagion of tranquillity in that alley of ancient paris which is so narrow that it is barred against carriages by a transverse beam placed on two posts which is deaf and dumb in the midst of the clamorous city dimly lighted at midday and is so to speak incapable of emotions between two rows of lofty houses centuries old which hold their peace like ancients as they are
there was a touch of stagnant oblivion in that street
jean valjean drew his breath once more there
how could he be found there
his first care was to place the inseparable beside him
he slept well
night brings wisdom we may add night soothes
on the following morning he awoke in a mood that was almost gay
he thought the dining room charming though it was hideous furnished with an old roundtable alongside board surmounted by a slanting mirror a dilapidated armchair and several plain chairs which were encumbered with toussaint's packages
i'm one of these packages jean valjean's uniform if a national guard was visible through agent
as for cosette she had had toussaint take some broth to her room and did not make her appearance until evening
about fiveo'clock toussaint who was going and coming and busting herself with the tiny establishment set on the table a cold chicken which cosette out of deference to her father consented to glance at
that done cosette under the pretext of an obstinate dick headache had base jean valjean good night and had shut herself up in her chamber
jean valjean had eaten a wing of the chicken with a good appetite and with his elbows on the table having gradually recovered his serenity had regained possession of his sense of security
while he was discussing this modest dinner he had twice or thrice noticed in a confused way toussaint's stammering words as she said to him monsieur there is something going on they are fighting in paris
but absorbed in a throng of inward calculations he had paid no need to it
to tell the truth he had not heard her
he rose and began to page from the door to the window and from the window to the door growing ever more serene
with this calm cosette his sole anxiety recurred to his thoughts
not that he was troubled by this headache a little nervous crisis a young girl's fit of silks the cloud of a moment there would be nothing left of it in a day or two by the meditated on the future and as was his habit be thought of it with pleasure
after all he saw no obstacle to their happy life resuming its course
at certain hours everything seems impossible at others everything appears easy jean valjean was in the midst of one of these good hours
they generally succeed the bad ones as day follows night by virtue of that law of succession and of contract which lies at the very foundation of nature and which superficial minds call antithesis
in this peaceful street where he had taken refuge jean valjean got rid of all that had been troubling him for some time past
this very fact that he had seen many shadows made him begin to perceive a little azure
to have quitted the rue plumer without complications of incidents was one good step already accomplished
perhaps it would be wise to go abroad if only for a few months and to set out for london
well they would go
what difference did it make to him whether he was in france or in england provided he had cosette beside him
cosette was his nation
rosette sufficed for his happiness the idea that he perhaps did not suffice for cosette's happiness that idea which had formerly been the cause of his fever and sleeplessness did not even present itself to his mind
he was in a state of collapse from all his past sufferings and he was fully entered on optimism
cosette was by his side she seemed to bet is an optical illusion which everyone has experienced
he arranged in his own mind with all sorts of felicitous devices his departure for england with cosette and he beheld his felicity reconstituted wherever he pleased in the perspective of his're very
as he paced to and fro with long strides his glance suddenly encountered something strange
in the inclined mirror facing him which surmounted the sideboard he saw the four lines which follow my dearest aids
my father insists on our setting out immediately
we shall be this evening in the rue del' homme arms no
in a week we shall be in england
cosette
june g h
jean valjean halted perfectly haggard
cosette on her arrival had placed her blotting book on the sideboard in front of the mirror and utterly absorbed in her agony of grief had forgotten it and left it there without even observing that she had left it wide open and open at precisely the page on which she had laid to dry the four lines which she has penned and which she had given in charge of the young workman in the rue plumer
the writing had been printed off on the blotter
the mirror reflected the writing
the result was what is called in geometry the symmetrical image so that the writing reversed on the blotter was right ed in the mirror and presented its natural appearance and jean valjean had beneath his eyes the letter written by cosette to marius on the preceding evening
it was simple and withering
jean valjean stepped up to the mirror
he read the four lines again but he did not believe them
they produced on him the effect of appearing in a flash of lightning
it was a hallucination it was impossible
it was not so
little by little his perceptions became more precise he looked at cosette's blotting book and the consciousness of the reality returned to him
he caught up the blotter and said it comes from there
he feverishly examined the four lines imprinted on the blotter the reversal of the letters converted into an odds crawl and he saw no sense in it
then he said to himself but this signifies nothing there is nothing written here
and he drew a long breath with inexpressible relief
who has not experienced those foolish joys in horrible instants
the soil does not surrender to despair until it has exhausted all illusions
he held the blotter in his hand and contemplated it in stupid delight almost ready to laugh at the hallucination of which he had been the dupe
all at once his eyes fell upon the mirror again and again he beheld the vision
there were the four lines outlined with inexorable clearness
this time it was no mirage
the recurrence of a vision is a reality it was palpable it was the writing restored in the mirror
he understood
jean valjean tottered dropped the blotter and fell into the old arm chair beside the buffet with dropping head and glassy eyes in utter bewilderment
he told himself that it was plain that the light of the world had been eclipsed forever and that cosette had written that to someone
then he heard his soul which had become terrible once more give vent to a full road in the gloom
try then the effect of taking from the lion the dog which he has in his cage
strange and dad today at that very moment marius had not yet received cosette's letter chance had treacherously carried it to jean valjean before delivering it to marius
up to that day jean valjean had not been vanquished by trial
he had been subjected to fearful proofs no violence of bad fortune had been spared him the ferocity of fate armed with all vindictiveness and all social scorn had taken him for her prey and has raged against him
he had accepted every extremity when it had been necessary he had sacrificed his inviolability as are formed man had yielded up his liberty risked his head lost everything suffered everything and he had remained disinterested and stoical to such a point that he might have been thought to be absent from himself like a martyr
his conscience inured to every assault of destiny might have appeared to be forever impregnable
well anyone who had beheld his spiritual self would have been obliged to concede that it weakened at that moment
it was because of all the tortures which he had undergone in the course of this long inquisition to which destiny had doomed him this was the most terrible
never had such pincers seized him hitherto
he felt the mysterious stirring of all his patent sensibilities
he felt the plucking at the strange chord
alas
the supreme trial let us say rather the only trial is the loss of the beloved being
poor old jean valjean certainly did not love cosette otherwise than as a father but we have already remarked above that into this paternity the widow told of his life had introduced all the shades of love he loved cosette as his daughter and he loved her as his mother and he loved her as his sister and as he had never had either a woman to love or a wide as nature is a creditor who accepts no protest that sentiment also the most impossible to lose was mingled with the rest vague ignorant pure with the purity of blindness unconscious celestial angelic divine less like a sentiment than like an instinct less like an instinct than like an imperceptible and invisible but real attraction and love properly speaking was in his immense tenderness for cosette like the thread of gold in the mountain concealed and virgin
let the reader recall the situation of heart which we have already indicated
no marriage was possible between them not even that of souls and yet it is certain that their destinies were wedded
with the exception of cosette that is to say with the exception of a childhood jean valjean had never in the whole of his long life known anything of that which may be loved
the passions and loves which succeed each other had not produced in him those successive green grow the tender green or dark green which can be seen on foliage which passes through the winter and in men who pass fifty
in short and we have insisted on it more than once all this interior fusion all this whole of which the sum total was a lofty virtue ended in rendering jean valjean a father to cosette
a strange father forged from the grandfather the son the brother and the husband that existed in jean valjean a father in whom there was included even a mother a father who lived cosette and adored her and who held that child as his light his home his family his country uk's paradise
thus when he saw that the end had absolutely come that she was escaping from him that she was slipping from his hands that she was gliding from him like a cloud like water when he had before his eyes this crushing proof another is the goal of her heart another is the wish of her life there is a dearest one i am no longer anything but her father i no longer exist when he could no longer doubt when he said to himself she is going away from me
the grief which he felt surpassed the bounds of possibility
to have done all that he had done for the purpose of ending like this
and the very idea of being nothing
then as we have just said a quiver of revolt ran through him from head to foot
he felt even in the very roots of his hair the immense reawakening of egotism and thei in this man's abuse howled
there is such a thing as the sudden giving way of the inward subsoil
a despairing certainty does not make its way into a man without thrusting aside and breaking certain profound elements which in some cases are the very man himself
grief when it attains this shape is a headlong flight of all the forces of the conscience
these are fatal crises
few among us emerge from the'm still like ourselves and firm in duty
when the limit of endurance is overstepped the most imperturbable virtue is disconcerted
jean valjean took the blotter again and convinced himself a fresh he remained bowed and as though petrified and with staring eyes over those four unobjectionable lines and there arose within him such a cloud that one might have thought that everything in this soul was crumbling away
he examined this revelation athwart the exaggerations of revert with an apparent and terrifying calmness for it is a fearful thing when a man's calmness reaches the coldness of the statue
he measured the terrible step which his destiny had taken without his having as i do i tion of the fact he recalled his fears of the preceding summer do foolishly dissipated he recognized the precipice it was still the same only jean valjean was no longer on the brink he was at the bottom of it
the unprecedented and heartrending thing about it was that he had fallen without perceiving it
all the light of his life had departed while he still fancied that he beheld the sun
his instinct did not hesitate
he put together certain circumstances certain dates certain blushed and certain pallor son cosette's part and he said to himself it is he
the divination of despair is a sort of mysterious bow which never misses its aim
he struck marius with his first conjecture
he did not know the name but he found the man instantly
he distinctly perceived in the background of the implacable conjugation of his memories the unknown prowler of the luxembourg that wretched seeker of love adventures that idler of romance that idiot that coward for it is cowardly to come and make eyes at young girls who have beside them a father who loves them
after he had thoroughly verified the fact that this young man was at the bottom of this situation and that everything proceeded from that quarter he jean valjean there generated msn the man who had so labored over his soul the man who had made so many efforts to resolve all loreall' misery and all unhappiness in to love looked into his own breast and there be held aspect rebate
great briefs contain something of rejection
they discourage one with existence
the man in to whom they enter feels something within him withdraw from him
in his youth their visits are lugubrious later on them are sinister
alas of despair is a fearful thing when the blood is not when the hair is black when the head is erect on the body like the flame on the torch when the roll of destiny still retains its full thickness when the heart full of desirable love still possesses beats which can be returned to it when one has time for redress when all women and all smiles and all the future and all the horizon are before one when the force of life is complete what is it in old age when the years hasten on growing ever paper to that twilight hour when one begins to behold the stars of the tomb
while he was meditating toussaint entered
jean valjean rose and asked her in what quarter is it
do you know
toussaint was struck dumb and could only answer him what is it sir
jean valjean began again did you not tell me that just now that there is fighting going on
wh
yes sir replied toussaint
it is in the direction of saint merry
there is a mechanical movement which comes to us unconsciously from the most profound depths of our thought
it was no doubt under the impulse of a movement of this sort and of which he was hardly conscious that jean valjean five minutes later found himself in the street
bareheaded he sat upon the stone post at the door of his house
he seemed to be listening
night had come
chapter ii the street urchin an enemy of light how long did he remain this
what was the ebb and flow of this tragic meditation
did he straighten up
did here mainboard
had he been bent to breaking
could he still rise and regain his footing in his conscience upon something solid
he probably would not have been able to tell himself
the street was deserted
a few uneasy bourgeois who were rapidly returning home hardly saw him
each one for himself in times of peril
the lamplighter same as usual to light the lantern which was situated precisely opposite the door or no
and then went away
jean valjean would not have appeared like a living man to anyone who had examined him in that shadow
he sat there on the post of his door motionless as a form of ice
there is congeal ment in despair
the alarm bells and a vague and stormy uproar were audible
in the midst of all these convulsions of the bell mingled with the revolt the clock of saint paul struck eleven gravely and without master of the npcs in osman the hour is god
the passage of the hour produced no effect on jean valjean jean valjean did not stir
still at about that moment a brusque report burst forth in the direction of the hapless second get more violent followed it was probably that attack on the barricade in the rue de la chambre tie which we have just seen repulsed by marius
at this double discharge whose duty seemed augmented by the stupor of the night jean valjean started he rose turning towards the quarter whence the noise proceeded then he fell back upon the post again folded his arms and his head slowly sank on his bosom again
he resumed his gloomy dialogue with himself
all at once he raised his eyes someone was walking in the street he heard steps near him
he looked and by the light of the kaj teens in the direction of the street which ran into the eu says archives he perceived a young livid and beaming face
gav roche had just arrived in the ruel' homme asme
gav roche was staring into the air apparently in search of some thing
he saw jean valjean perfectly well but he took no notice of him
gav roche after staring into the air stated below he raised himself on tiptoe and felt of the doors and windows of the ground floor they were all shut bolted and padlocked
after having authenticated the fronts or five or six barricaded houses in this manner the urchin shrugged his shoulders and took himself to task in these terms parsi
then he began to stare into the air again
jean valjean who an instant previously in his then state of mind would not have spoken to or even answered anyone felt irresistibly impelled to accost that child
what is the matter with you my little fellow
he said
the matter with me is that i am hungry replied nav roche frankly
and he added little fellow yourself
jean valjean fumbled in his bob and pulled out a five franc piece
but has roche who was of the wagtail species and who skipped vivaciously from one gesture to another had just picked up a stone
he had caught sight of the lantern
see here said he you still have your lanterns here
you see disobeying the regulations my friend
this is disorderly
smash that for me
and he flung the stone at the lantern whose broken glass fell with such a clatter that the bourgeois in hiding behind their curtains in the opposite house cried there is' ninety three' come again
the lantern oscillated violently and went out
the street had suddenly become black
that's right old street ejaculated gave if he put on your nightcap
and turning to jean valjean what do you call that gigantic monument that you have there at the end of the street
it's the archivesisn't it
i must crumble up those big stupid's of pillars a bit and make a nice barricade out of them
jean valjean stepped up to gev roche
poor creature he said in a low tone and speaking to himself he is hungry
and be laid the hundreds ou piece in his hand
gav roche raised his face astonished at the size of this sound stared at it in the darkness and the whiteness of the big sky dazzled him
he knew five franc pieces by hearsay their reputation was agreeable to him he was delighted to see one close to
he said let us contemplate the tiger
he gazed at it for several minutes in ecstasy then turning to jean valjean he held out the coin to him and said majestically to him bourgeois i prefer to smash lanterns
take back your ferocious beast
you can' thrive me
that has got five class but itdoesn't scratch me
have you another
asked jean valjean
yafro she replied more than you have perhaps
well returned jean valjean keep the money for your mother
gav roche was touched
moreover he had just noticed that the man who was addressing him had not stand this inspired him with confidence
truly said he so it wasn't to keep me from breaking the lanterns
break whatever you please
you're a fine man said had to the
and he put the five franc piece into one of his pockets
his confidence having increased he added do you belong in this street
yes why
can you tell me where no
is
what do you want with no
here the child paused he feared that he had said too much he thrust his nails energetically into his hair and content fs himself with replying am
here it is
an idea flashed through jean valjean's mind
anguish does have the series us
he said to the law are you the person who is bringing a letter that i am fx lecting
you
said had roche
you are not a woman
the letter is for mademoiselle cosette is it not
cosette muttered had roche
yes i believe that is the queer name
well resumed jean valjean i am the person to whom you are to deliver the letter
give it here
in that case you must know that i was sent from the barricade
of course said jean valjean
fabric be engulfed his hand in another of his pockets and drew out a paper folder in four
then he made the military salute
respect for despatches said he
it comes from the provisional government
give it to me said jean valjean
gave if he held the paper elevated above his head
don't go and fancy it's a love letter
it is for a woman buy it's for the people
wemen fight and we respect the fair sex
we are not as they are in fine society where there are lions who send chickens to camels
give it to me
after all continued had roche you have the air of an honest man
give it to me quick
catch hold of it
and he handed the paper to jean valjean
and make haste monsieur what's your name for man selleck sette is waiting
gav roche was satisfied with himself for having produced this remark
jean valjean began again is it to saint merry that the answer is to be sent
there you are making some of those bits of pastry vulgarly called brooches blunders
this letter comes from the barricade of the rue de la chambre die and i'm going back there
good evening citizen
that said gave if he took himself off or to describe it more exactly fluttered away in the direction whence he had come with a flight like that of an escaped bird
he plunged back into the gloom as though he made whole unit with the rigid rapidity of a projectile the alley ofl' homme arms became silent and solitary once more in a twinkling that strange child who had about him something of the shadow and if the dream had buried himself in the mists of the rows of black houses and was lost there like smoke in the dark and one might have thought that he has dissipated and vanished had there not taken place a few minutes after his disappearance a startling shiver of glass and had not the magnificent crash of a lantern rattling down on the pavement inxs more abruptly awakened the indignant bourgeois
it was gavel she upon his way through the rue du chaume
chapter iii while cosette and toussaint are asleep jean valjean went into the house with marius' letter
hey roped his way up the stairs as pleased with the darkness as an owl who grips his prey opened and shut his door softly listened to see whether he could hear any noise made sure that to all appearances cosette and toussaint were asleep and plunged three or four matches into the bottle of the duma delighted before he could evoke a spark so greatly did his hand tremble
what he had just done smacked of theft
at last the candle was lighted he leaned his elbows on the table involved the paper and read
in violent emotions one does not read one clings to the earth so to speak the paper which one holds one clutches it like a victim one crushed it one digs into it the nails of one's wrath of of one's not one hastens to the end one leaps to the beginning attention is at fever hear it takes up in the gross as it were the essential points it seized on one point and the test disappears
in marius' note to cosette jean valjean was only these words i die
when thou read est this my soul will be near the e
in the presence of these two lines he was horribly dazzled he remained for a moment crushed as it were by the change of emotion which was taking place within him he stared at marius' note with a sort of intoxicated amazement he had before his eyes that splendor the death of shared individual
he uttered a frightful cry of inward joy
so it was all over
the catastrophe had arrived sooner than he had dared to hope
the being who instructed his destiny was disappearing
that man had taken himself off of his own accord free it willingly
this man was going to his death and he jean valjean had had no hand in the matter and it was through no fault of his
perhaps even he is already dead
here his fever entered into calculations
note is not dead yet
the letter had evidently been intended for cosette to read on the following morning after the two discharges that were heard between eleveno'clock and midnight nothing more has taken place the barricade will not be attacked seriously until daybreak but that makes no difference from the moment when that man is concerned in this war he is lost he is caught in the hearing
jean valjean felt himself delivered
so he was about to find himself alone with cosette once more
the rivalry would cease the future was beginning again
he had but to keep this note in his pocket
cosette would never know what had become of that man
all that there required to be done is to let things take their own course
this man can not escape
if he is not already wear it is certain that he is about to die
what good fortune
having said all this to himself he became gloomy
then he went downstairs and woke up the porter
about an hour later jean valjean went out in the complete costume of a national guard and with his arms
the porter has easily found in the neighborhood the wherewithal to complete his equipment
he had a loaded gun and a cartridge box filled with cartridges
he strode off in the direction of the markets
chapter iv had roche's excess of zeal in the meantime gave if he had had an adventure
gav roche after having conscientiously stoked the lantern in the rue du chaume entered the rue des vielle shaker of the sand not seeing even a cat there he thought the opportunity a good one to strike up all the song of which he was capable
his march far from being regarded by his singing was accelerated by ot
he began to sow along the sleeping or terrified houses these incendiary coupletsl' oiseau merit dans les char mille set pretend qu' hier ayala and cum russes's nails

gav roche as he sang was lavish of his pantomime
gesture is the strong point of the refrain
his face an inexhaustible repertory of masks produced grimaces more convulsing and more fantastic than the rents of a cloth torn in a high gale
unfortunately as he was alone and as it was night this was neither seen nor even visible
such wastes of riches do occur
all at once he stopped short
let us interrupt the romance said he
his feline she had it's fees cried in the recess of a carriage door what is called in painting an ensemble that is to say a person and a thing the thing was a hand cart the person was a man from auberge he who was sleeping there in
the shafts of the cat treated in the pavement and the auger that's head was supported against the front of the cart
his body was fouled up on this inclined plane and his feet touched the ground
have of me with his experience of the things of this world recognized a drunken man
he was some corner errand man who had drunk too much and was sleeping too much
there now thought had roche that's what the summer nights are good for
we'll take the cart for the republic and leave the auger that for the monarchy
his mind had just been illuminated by this flash of light how bully that cart would look on our barricade
the auger that was snoring
gavel she gently tugged at the cast from behind and at the auger that from the front that is today by the feet and at the expiration of another minute the imperturbable auger that was reposing flat on the pavement
the cart was free
gav roche habituated to facing the unexpected in all quarters had everything about him
he fumbled in one of his pockets and pulled from its scrap of paper and a bit of red pencil fulcher from come carpenter
he wrote french republic
received thy cart
and he signed it had roche
that done he put the paper in the pocket of the still snoring auger that's velvet best seized the cart shafts in both hands and set off in the direction of the halles pushing the card before him at a hard gallop with a glorious and triumphant uproar
this was perilous
there was a post at the royal printing establishment
gav roche did not think of this
this post was occupied by the national guards of the suburbs
the squad began to wake up and heads were raised from camp beds
two street lanterns broken in succession that dirty suny at the top of the lungs
this was a great deal for those cowardly streets which desire to go to sleep at sunset and which put the extinguisher on their candles at such an early hour
for the last hour that boy had been creating an uproar in that peaceable arrondissement the uproar of a fly in a bottle
the sergeant of the banlieue lent a year
he waited
he was a prudent man
the mad rattle of the cart filled to overflowing the possible measure of waiting and decided the sergeant to make are connais ance
there'sa whole band of them there
said he let us proceed gently
it was clear that the hydra of anarchy had emerged from its box and that it was stalking abroad through the quarter
and the sergeant ventured out of the post with cautious tread
all at once had roche pushing his cart in front of jim and at the very moment when he was about to turn into the rue des viel les baux diet yes found himself face to face with a uniform as halo a plume and a gun
for the second time he stopped short
hullo said he it's him
good day public order
gav roche's amazement was always brief and speedily thawed
where are you going you rascal
shouted the sergeant
citizen retorted had roche i haven't called you' bourgeois' yet
why do you insult me
where are you going you rogue
monsieur retorted had roche perhaps you were a man of wit yesterday but you have degenerated this morning
i ask you where are you going you villain
garros he replied you speak prettily
really no one would suppose you a sold as you are
you ought to sell all your hair at a hundred francs a piece
that would yield you five hundred francs
where are you going
where are you going
where are you going bandit
yafro she retorted again what villainous words
you must wipe your mouth better the first time that they give you suck
the sergeant lowered his bayonet
will you tell me where you are going you wretch
general said had roche i'm on my way to look for a doctor for my wife who is in labor
to arms
shouted the sergeant
the masterstroke if strong men consists in saving themselves by the very means that have ruined them gave if he took in the whole situation at a glance
it was the cart which had told against him it was the carr's place to protect him
at the moment when the sergeant was on the point of making his descent in fact oche the cart converted into a projectile and launched with all the latter's might rolled down upon him curiously and the sergeant's truck full in the stomach tumbled over backwards into the gutter while his gun went off in the air
the men of the post had rushed out pell hell at the sergeant's about the shot brought on a general random discharge after which they replaced their weapons and began again
this blind man's buff musketry lasted for a quarter of an hour and killed several lakes of glass
in the meanwhile had roche who had retraced his steps at full speed halted five or did streets distant and seated himself panting on the stone posts high forms the corner of the enfants rounds
he listened
after panting for a few minutes he turned in the direction where the fusillade was raging lifted his left hand to a level with his nose and thrust it forward three times as he slapped the back of his head with his right hand an imperious gesture in which parisian street urchin dom has condensed french irony and which is evidently efficacious since it has already lasted half a century
this gayety was troubled by one bitter reflection
yes said he i'm splitting with laughter i'm twisting with delight is found in joy but i'm losing my way i shall have to take a roundabout way
if i only reach the barricade in season
thereupon he set out again on a run
and as he ran am by the way where was i
said he
and he resumed his witty as he plunged rapidly through the streets and this is what died away in the gloom mais il rest web coffees bastille set je vais may feel whole dansl' or republic que voila

the post's recourse to arms was not without result
the cart was conquered the drunken man was taken prisoner
the first was put in the pound the second was later on somewhat harassed before the councils of war as an accomplice
the public ministry of the day proved its indefatigable deal in the defence of society in this instance
gav roche's adventure which has lingered as a tradition in the quarters of the temple is one of the most terrible souvenirs of the elderly bourgeois of the marais and is entitled in their memories the nocturnal attack by the post of the royal printing establishment
the end of volume iv
saint denis volume v jean valjean illustration frontispiece volume five illustration title page volume five book first
the war between four walls chapter i. the charybdis of the faubourg saint antoine and the scylla of the faubourg du temple the two most memorable barricades which the observer of social maladies can make do not belong to the period in which the action of this work is laid
these two barricades both of them symbols under two different aspects of a redoubtable situation sprang from the earth at the time of the fatal insurrection of june the greatest war of the streets that history has ever beheld
it sometimes happens that even contrary to principles even contrary to liberty equality and fraternity even contrary to the universal vote even contrary to the government by all for all from the depths of its anguish of its discouragement's and its destitution so tits fevers of its distressed of its miasma's of its ignorance's of its darkness that great and despairing body the rabble protests against and that the populace wages battle against the people
beggars attack the common right the och list actrices against demos
these are melancholy days for there is always a certain amount of might even in this madness there is suicide in this fuel and those words which are intended to be insults beggar scan will el culo craft populace exhibit aids
rather the fault of those who reign than the fault of those who suffer rather the fault of the privileged than the fault of the disinherited
for our own part we never pronounce those words without pain and without respect for when philosophy fathoms the facts to which they correspond it often finds many a grandeur beside the semi series
athens was a noch loc racy the beggars were the making of holland the populace saved rome more than once and the rabble followed jesus christ
there is no thinker who has not at times contemplated the magnificence x of the lower classes
it was of this rabble that saint jerome was thinking no doubt and of all these poor people and all these vagabonds and all these miserable people whence sprang the apostles and then aethra when he uttered this mysterious saying ff curb isle corbis the dregs of the city the law of the earth
the exasperation's of this crowd which suffers and bleed site violence's contrary to all sense directed against the principles which are its life it's masterful deeds against the right are its popular couldd' etat and should be repressed
the man of probity sacrificed himself and out of his very love for this crowd he combats it
but how excusable he feels it even while holding out against it
how he generates it even while resisting it
this is one of those rare moments when while doing that which it is one's duty to do one feels something which did concerts one and which would dissuade one from proceeding further one persists it is necessary but conscience though satisfied is sad and the accomplishment of duty is complicated with a pain at the heart
june let us hasten to say was an exceptional fact and almost impossible or classification in the philosophy of history
all the words which we have just uttered must be discarded when it becomes a question of this extraordinary revolt in which one feels the holy anxiety of toil claiming it's rights
it was necessary to combat it and this was a duty for it attacked the republic
but what was june at bottom
a revolt of the people against itself
where the subject is not lost sight of there is no digression may we then be permitted to arrest the reader's attention for a moment on the two absolutely unique barricades of which we have just spoken and which characterizes this insurrection
one blocked the entrance to the faubourg saint antoine the other defended the approach to the faubourg du temple those before whom these two fearful masterpieces of civil war reared themselves beneath the brilliant blue sky of june will never forget them
the saint antoine barricade was tremendous it was three stories high and seven hundred feet wide
it barred the vast opening of the faubourg that is to say three streets from angle to angle ravines jagged cut up divided seen elated with an immense rent buttressed with piles that were bastions in themselves throwing out capes here and there powerfully backed up by two great prom on tories of houses of the faubourg i treated myself like a cyclops and ike at the end of the formidable place which had seen the th of july
nineteen barricades were ranged one behind the other in the depths of the streets behind this principal barricade
at the very sight of it one felt the agonizing suffer in fig the immense faubourg which had reached that point of extremity when a distress may become a catastrophe
of what was that barricade made
of the ruins of three six story houses demolished expressly said some
of the prodigy of all deaths said others
it does the lamentable aspect of all constructions of hatred ruin
it might be asked who built this
it might also be said who destroyed this
it was the improvisation of the ebullition
hold
take this door
this grating
this penthouse
this chimney piece
this broken brazier
this cracked pot
give all
cast away all
push this rolls in dismantle overturn ruin everything
it was the collabora tion of the pavement the block of stone the beam the bar of it on the rag the scrap the broken pane the unseated chair the cabbage stalk the tagger the day and the male fiction
it was grand and it was petty
it was the abyss parodied on the public place by hubbub
the mass beside the atom the strip of ruined wall and the broken bow o threatening fra ger nization of every sort of rubbish
sisyphus had thrown his rock there and job to spot where
terrible in short
it was the acropolis of the barefooted
overturned carts broke the uniform ltu of the slope an immense drag was spread out there crossways its axle pointing heavenward and seemed a scar on that tumultuous facade an omnibus hoisted gayly by main force to the very summit of the heap as though the architects of this bit of savagery had wished to add a touch of the street urchin humor to their terror presented its horseless in harnessed pole to no one knows what horses of the air
this gigantic heap the alluvium of the revolt figured to them in da nossa on pelion of all revolutions' on' they got thermidor ont meth of august theft of bruna ire ont meth of january genre jiwire on oral dialog
the situation deserved the trouble and this barricade was worthy to figure on the very spot whence the bastille had disappeared
if the ocean made dikes it is thus that it would build
the fury of the flood was stamped upon this shapeless mass
what flood
the crowd
one thought one be held hubbub petrified
one thought one heard humming above this barricade as though there had been over their give enormous darkness of violent progress
was it a thicket
was it a bacchanal ia
was its fortress
vertigo seemed to have constructed it with blows of its wings
there was something of the cesspool in that we doubt and something olympian in that confusion
one there be held in april hell full of despair the rafters of roofs bits of garret windows with their figured paper windows ashes with their glass planted there in the ruins awaiting the canyon wrecks of chimneys cupboards fables benches howling to pay turvey dom and those thousand poverty stricken things the very refuse of the mendicant which contain at the same time fury and nothingness
one would have said that it was the fathers of a people days of wood of iron of bronze of stone and that the faubourg saint antoine had thrust out here at its door with a colossal flourish of the broom making of its misery its barricade
blocks resembling heads man's blocks dislocated chains pieces of wood work with brackets having the form of tibbets horizontal wheels projecting from the rubbish amalgamated with this edifice of anarchy the sombre figure of the old tortures endured by the people
the barricade saint antoine converted everything into a weapon everything that civil war could throw at the head of society proceeded thence it was not combat it was a paroxysm the carbines which defended this redoubt among which there were some blunder busses sent bits of earthenware bones coat buttons even the casters from nightstands dangerous projectiles on account of the brass
this barricade was furious it hurled to the clouds an inexpressible clamor at certain moments when provoking the army it was covered with throngs and tempest a tumultuous crowd of flaming heads crowned it as warm bill edit it had a thorny crest of guns of sabres of cudgels of axes of pikes and of bayonets a vast red flag flapped in the wind shouts of command songs of attack the roll of drugs the sons of women and bursts of gloomy laughter from the starving were to be heard there
it was huge and living and like the back of an electric beast there proceeded from it little flashes of lightning
the spirit of revolution covered with its cloud this summit where fumbled that voice of the people which resembles the voice of god a strange majesty was emitted by this titanic basket of rubbish
it was a heap of filth and it was sinai
as we have said previously it attacked in the name of the revolution what
the revolution
it that barricade chance hazard disorder terror his understanding the unknown had facing it the constituent assembly the sovereignty of the people universal suffrage the nation the republic and it was the car mag mile bidding defiance to the marseillaise
immense but heroic defiance for the old faubourg is a hero
the faubourg and its redoubt lend each other assistance
the faubourg shouldered the recount the redoubt took its stand under cover of the faubourg
the vast barricade spread out like a cliff against which the strategy of the african general's dashed itself
it's caverns its ease essences its warts it's big bowl ties grimaced so to speak and grinned beneath the smoke
the mit taille vanished in shapeless ness the bombs plunged into it billets only succeeded in making holes in it what was the use of cannon a ring chaos
and the regiments accustomed to the fiercest visions of war based within easy eyes on that species of redoubt a wild beast in its boat like bristling and a mountain by its enormous size
a quarter of a league away from the corner of the rue du temple which we bouches on the boulevard near the chateaud' eau if one thrift one's head bodily beyond the point formed by the front of the d allemagne shop one perceived in the distance beyond the canal on the street which mounts the slopes of belleville at the culminating point of the rise a strange wall reaching to the second story of the house fronts a sort of hyphen between the houses on the right and the houses on the left as though the street had folded back on itself its loftiest's all in order to close itself abruptly
this wall was built of paving stones
it was straight correct cold perpendicular levelled with the square laid out by rule and line
cement was lacking of course but as in the case of certain roman walls without interfering with its rigid architecture
the en tablature was mathematically parallel with the base
from distance to distance one could distinguish on the gray surface almost invisible loopholes which resembles black threads
these loopholes were separated from each other br equal spaces
the street was deserted as far as the eye could reach
all windows and doors were closed
on the back ground rowe this barrier which made a blind thoroughfare of the streets motionless and tranquil wall no one was visible nothing was audible not a cry not a sound not a breath
a sepulchre
the dazzling sum of june inundated this terrible thing with light
it was the barricade of the faubourg of the temple
as soon as one arrived on the spot and caught sight of it it was impossible even for the boldest not to become thoughtful before this mysterious apparition
it was adjusted mounted on fri dated rectilinear symmetrical and funereal
science and gloom matt here
one felt that the chief of this barricade was a geometric is not a spectre
one looked at it and spoke low
from time to time of some soldier an officer or representative of the people chanced to traverse the deserted highway a faint sharp whistle was heard and the passer by fell dead or wounded or if he escaped the bullet sometimes a fiscal eg was seen town sconce itself in some closed shutter in the inter stice between two blocks of stone or in the plaster of a wall
for the men in the barricade had made themselves two small cannons out of two cast iron lengths of gas pipe plugged up at one end with god and fireclay
there was no waste of useless powder
nearly every shot told
there were corpses here and there and pools of blood on the pavement
i remember a white butterfly which went and came in the street
summer does not abdicate
in the neighborhood the spaces beneath the lodges doc here's were encumbered with wounded
one felt oneself aimed at by some person whom one did not see and one understood that guns were levelled at the whole length of the street
massed behind the sort of sloping ridge which the vaulted canal forms at the entrance to the faubourg du temple the soldiers of the attacking column gravely and thoughtfully watched this dismal redoubt this immobility this passivity whence sprang death
some crawled flat on their faces as far as the creator the curve of the bridge taking care that their stamos did not project beyond it
the valiant colonel mon reynard admired this barricade with a shudder
how that is built
he said to a representative
not one paving stone projects beyond its neighbor
it is made of porcelain
at that moment a bullet broke the cross on his breast and he fell
the cowards
people said
let them show themselves
let us see them
they dare not
they are hiding
the barricade of the faubourg du temple defended by eighty men attacked by ten thousand held out for three days
on the fourth they did as a tz watch was at constantine they pierced the houses they came over the roofs the barricade was taken
not one of the eighth cowards thought of flight all were killed there with the excep tion of the leader barthelemy of whom we shall speak presently
the saint antoine barricade was the tumult of thunder's the barricade of the temple was silence
the div ference between these two recounts was the difference between the formidable and the sinister
one seemed am as the others mask
admitting that the gigantic and gloomy insurrection of mine was composed of a wrath end of an enigma one divined in the first barricade the dragon and behind the second the sphinx
these two fortresses had been erected by two men named the one fournet the other barthelemy
fournet made the saint antoine barricade barthelemy the barricade of the temple
each was the image of the man who had built it
fournet was a man of lofty stature he had broad shoulders a red face a crushing vista gold heart a loyal soul a sincere and terrible the
intrepid energetic irascible stormy the most cordial of men the most formidable of combatants
war strife conflict were the very air he breathed and put him in a good humor
he had been an officer in the navy and from his gestures and his voice one divined that he sprang from the ocean and that he came from the tempest he carried the hurricane on into battle
with the exception of the genius there was in four get something of canton as with the exception of the divinity there was in canton something of hercules
barthelemy thin feeble pale taciturn was a sort of tragic street urchin who having had his ears boxed by a policeman latin wait for him and killed him and at seventeen was sent to the galleys
he came out and made this barricade
later on fatal circumstance in london proscribed by all barthelemy slew fournet
it was a funereal duel
some time afterwards caught in the hearing of one of those mysterious adventures in which passion plays a part a catastrophe in which french justice sees extenuating circumstances and in which english justice sees only death barthelemy was hanged
the sombre social construction is so made that thanks to material destitution thanks to moral obscurity that unhappy being who possessed an intelligence certainly firm possibly great began in france with the valleys and ended in england with the gallows
barthelemy on occasion flew but one flag the black flag
chapter ii what is to be done in the abyss of one does not converse sixteen years count in the subterranean education of insurrection and june knew a great deal more about it than june
so the barricade of the rue de lacy and eerie was only an outline and an embryo compared to the two colossal barricades which we have just sketched but it was formidable foe that epoch
the insurgents under the eye of em hold as for marius no longer looked after anything had made good use of the night
the barricade had been not only repaired but augmented
they had raised it two feet
bars of iron planted in the pavement resembled lance sinfest
all sorts of rubbish brought and added from all directions complicated the external confusion
there doubt had been cleverly made over into a wall on the inside and a thicket on the outside
the staircase of paving stones which permitted one to mount it like the fall of a citadel had been reconstructed
the barricade had been put in order the two rooms is encumbered the kitchen appropriated for the ambulance the dressing of the wounded completed the powder scattered on the ground and on the tables had been gathered up bullets run cartridges manufactured lint scraped the fallen weapons redistributed the interior if there doubt cleaned the rubbish swept up corpses removed
they laid the dead in a heap in the monde your land of which they were still the masters
the pavement wasted for a long time at that spot
among the dead there were four national guardsmen of the suburbs
enjoi rashad their uniforms laid aside
enjoi has had advised two hours of sleep
advice from en hold as was a command
still only three or four took advantage of it
re hilly employed these two hours in engraving this inscription on the wall which faced the tavern long live the peoples
these four words hollowed out in the rough stone with a nail could be still read on the wall in
the three women has profited by the respite of the night to vanish definitely which allowed the insurgents to breathe more freely
they had found means of taking refuge in some neighboring house
the greater part of the wounded were able and wished to fight still
on a litter of mattresses and trusses of straw in the kitchen which had been converted into an ambulance there were five men gravely wounded two of whom were municipal guardsmen
the municipal guardsmen were attended to first
in the tap room there remained only have it under his black cloth and javert bound to his post
this is the hall of the dead said enjoi faq
in the interior of this hall barely lighted by a candle at one end the mortuary table being behind the post like a horizontal bars sort of vast vague cross resulted from javert erect and kan du flying prone
the pole of the omnibus although snapped off by the fusillade was still sufficiently up right to admit of their fastening the flag to it
enjoi raw who possessed that quality of a leader of always doing what he said attached to this staff the bullet ridden and bloody cost of the old man's
note past had been possible
there was neither bread nor meat
the fifty men in the barricade had speedily exhausted the scanty provisions of the wine shop during the sixteen hours which they had passed there
at a given moment every barricade inevitably becomes the raft of lakes use
they were obliged to resign themselves to hunger
they had then reached the first hours of that spartan day of the th of june when in the barricade saint merry jeanne surround ex by the insurgents who demanded bread replied to all combatants crying something to eat
with any
it is threeo'clock at four we shall be dead
as they could no longer eaten no less forbade them to drink
he interdicted wine and portioned out the brandy
they had found in the cellar fifteen full bottles hermetically sealed
enjoi gas and combed were examined them
con be ferre when he came up again said it's the old stock of father much epo up who began business as a grocer
it must be real wine observed bosquet
it's lucky that grant site is asleep
if he were on foot there would be a good deal of difficulty in saving those bottles
enjoi gas in spite of all murmurs placed his veto on the fifteen bottles and in order that no one might touch them he had them placed under the table on which father have it was lying
about twoo'clock in the morning they reckoned up their strength
there were still thirty seven of them
the day began to dawn
the torch which had been replaced in its cavity in the pavement had just been extinguished
the interior of the barricade that species of tiny courtyard appropriated from the street was bathed in shadows and resembled a thwart the vague twilight horror the deck of a disabled ship
the combatants as they went and came moved about the're like black forms
above that terrible meeting place of gloom the stories of the mute houses were lucidly outlined at the very top the chimneys stood pa kept out
the sky was of that charming undecided tue which may be white and maybe blue
birds flew about in it with cries of joy
the lofty house which formed the back of the barricade being turned to the east had upon its roots rosy reflection
the morning breeze ruffled the gray hair on the head of the dead man at the third story window
i am delighted that the torch has been extinguished said source tract of skill y
that torch flickering in the wind annoyed me
it had the appearance of being a fraud
the light of torches resembles the wisdom of cowards it gives a bad light because it trembles
dawn awakens minds as it does the birds all began to talk
holy perceiving a cat prowling on stutter extracted philosophy from it
what is the cat
he exclaimed
it is a corrective
the good god having made the mouse said' hullo
i have committed a blunder
' and so he made the cat
the cat is the stratum of the mouse
the mouse plus the cat is the proof of creation revised and corrected
com never're surrounded by students and artisans was speaking of the dead of jean proud site offshore log have it and even if can i can woven no iraq's ad severity
he said harm prius and ariston it on brutus c here as stephanus cromwell charlotte for days and have all had their moment of agony when it was too late
our hearts quiver so and human life is such a mystery that even in the case of a civic murder even in a murder for liberation if there be such a thing the remorse for having struck a man surpasses the joy of having served the human race
and such are the windings of the exchange of speech that a moment later by a transition brought about through jean proud site's verses com never re was comparing the translators of the georgi car aux with four hands our bandwith de lille pointing out the passages translated by maldi latte particularly the prodigies of caesar's death and at that word caesar the conversation reverted to brutus
caesar said combed free cell justly
cicero was severe towards caesar and he was right
that severity is not diatribe
when soil us insults homer when marcius insults virgil when vice insults moliere when pope insults shakspeare when frederic insults voltaire it is an old law of envy and hatred which is being carried out genius attracts insult great men are always more or less barked at
but soil us and cicero are two different persons
cicero is an arbiter in thought just as brutus is an arbiter by the sword
for my own la rhino and that last justice the fixer but antiquity admitted it
caesar the violator of the rubicon conferring as though they came from him the dignities which emanates from the people not rising at the entrance of the senate committee the acts of doing and almost of a tyrant regia aspens tyrannis a
he was a great man so much the worse or so much the better the lesson is but the more exalted
his twenty three wounds touch me less than the spitting in the face of jesus christ
caesar is stabbed by the senators christi scuffed by lackeys
one feels the god through the greater outrage
bossier who towered above the interlocutors from the summit of a heap of paving stones exclaimed rifle in hand ohchr athenaeum on myrrh in us on proval in this in grades of these antlers
oh
who will grant me to pronounce the verses of homer like a greek of laurium of over alteon
chapter iii light and shadows by olga's had been to make a reconnaissance
he had made his way out through monde four lane gliding along close to the houses
the insurgents we will remark were full of hope
the manner in which they had repulsed the attack of the preceding night had caused them to almost disdain in advance the attack at dawn
they waited for it with a smile
they had no more doubt as to their success than as to their cause
moreover succor was evidently on the way to them
they reckoned on it
with that facility of triumphant prophecy which is one of the sources of strength in the french combatant they divided the day which was at hand into three distinct phases
at sixo'clock in the morning a regiment which had been labored with would turn at noon the insurrection of all paris at sunset revolution
they heard the alarm bell of saint merry which had not been silent for an instant since the night before a proof that the other barricade the great one jeanne's still held out
all these hopes were exchanged between the different groups in a sort of gay and formidable whisper which resembled the warlike humor above offers
enjoi rss reappeared
he returned from his son free able flight into outer darkness
he listened for a moment to all this joy with folded arms and one hand on his mouth
they fresh and rosy in the growing whiteness of the dawn he said the whole army of paris is to strike
a third of the army is bearing down upon the barricades in which you how are
there is the national guard in addition
i have picked out the stamos of the fifth of the line and the standard bearers of the sixth legion
in one hour you will be attached
as for the populace it was sad thing yesterday today it is not stirring
there is nothing to expect nothing to hold for
neither from a faubourg not from a regiment
you are abandoned
these words fell upon the buzzing of the groups and produced on them the effect caused on a swarm of bees by the first drops of a storm
a moment of indescribable sil' anse ensued in which death might have been heard flitting by
this moment was brief
a voice from the obscure at depths of the groups shouted town no less so be it
let us raise the barricade to a height of twenty feet and let us all remain in it
citizens let us offer the protests of corpses
let us show that if the people abandon the republicans the republicans do not abandon the people
these words freed the thought of all from the painful cloud of individual anxieties
it was hailed with an enthusiastic acclamation
no one ever had known the name of the man who spoke thus he was some unknown blouse wearer a stranger a man forgotten a passing hero that great anonymous always mingled in human crises and in social genesee who at a given moment utters in a supreme fashion the decisive word and who vanished into the shadows after having represented for a minute in a lightning flash the people and god
this inexorable resolution so thoroughly impregnated the air of the th of june that almost at the very same hour on the barricade saint merry the insurgents were raising that clamor which has become a matter of history and which has been consigned to the documents in the case what matters of whether they come to our assistance or not
let us get ourselves killed here to the very last man
as the reader sees the two barricades though materially isolates were in communication with each other
chapter in minus five plus one after the man who decreed the protest of corpses had spoken and had given this formula of their common soul there issued from all mouths a strangely satisfied and terrible cry funereal incense and triumphant in tone long live death
let us all remain here
why all
walden no less
all
all
enjoi rss resumed the position is good the barricade is vine
thirty men are enough
why sacrifice forty
they replied because not one will go away
citizens frieden no less and there was an almost irritated vibration in his voice this republic is not rich enough in men to indulge in useless expenditure of them
vainglory is waste
if the duty of some is to depart that duty should be fulfilled like any other
em hold as the man principle has over his co religionists that sort of omnipotent power which emanates from the absolute
still great as was this omnipotence a murmur a dose
a leader to the very fingertips em hold as seeing that they murmured insisted
he resumed haughtily let those who are afraid of not numbering more than thirty days o
the murmurs redoubled
besides observed a voice in one group it is easy enough to talk about leaving
the barricade is hemmed in
not on the side of the hapless aiden moorad
the tue jun detour is free and through the rue des pres heirs one can reach the marched es innocents
and there went on another voice you would be captured
you would fall in with some grand guard of the kind of the suburbs they will apt a man passing in blouse and cap
's hence come you
''don't you belong to the barricade
' and they will look at your hands
you smell of powder
shot
enjoi rss without making any reply touched com brewers's shoulder and the two entered the tap room
they emerged thence a moment later
fn no less held in his outstretched hands the four uniforms which he had laid aside
combed were followed carrying the shoulder belts and the stamos
with this uniforms dicen hold as you can mingle with the ranks and escape here is enough for four
and he flung on the ground deprived of its pavement the four uniforms
no wavering took place in his st. local audience
com be ferrero on the word
come said he you must have a little pity
do you know what the question is here
it is a question of women
see here
are there women or are there for
are there children or are there not
are there mothers yes or how to rock cradles with their foot and who have a lot of little ones around them
let that man of you who had never be held a nurse's breast raise his hand
ah
you want to get yourselves killed so do ii who am speaking to you but i do not want to feel the phantoms of women are a thing their arms around me
die if you will butdon't make others die
suicides like that which is on the brink of accomplishment here are sublime but suicide is narrow and does not admit of extension and as soon as it touches your neighbors suicide is murder
think of the little blond heads think of the white locks
listen em hold as has just told me that he saw at the corner of the rue du cygne a lighted casement a candle in a poor window on the fifth floor and on the pane the quivering shadow of the head of an old woman who had the air of having spent the night in watching
perhaps she is the mother if someone if you
we'll let that mango and make haste to say to his mother' here i am mother
' let him feel at ease the task here will be performed all the same
when one supports one's relatives by one's tool one has not the right to sacrifice one's self
that is deserting one's family
and those who have daughters
what are you thinking of
you get yourselves killed you are dead that is well
and tomorrow
young girls without bread that is a terrible thing
manners woman sells
ah
those charming and gracious beings so gracious and so sweet who have bonnets off lowered to fill the house with purity who sing and prattle who are like a loving perfume who prove the existence of angels in heaven by the purity of virgins on earth that jeanne that lose that jimi those adorable and honest creatures who are your blessings and your price am
good god they will suffer hunger
what do you want me to say to you
there is a market for human flesh and it is not with your shadowy hands shuddering around them that you will prevent them from entering it
think of the street think of the pavement covered with passersby think of the shops past which women to and come with necks all bars and through the more
these women flowers pure once
think of your sisters those of you who have them
misery prostitution the police saint lazare that is what those beautiful delicate girls those fragile marvels of modesty gentleness and loneliness fresher than lilacs in the month of may will come to
ah
you have got yourselves killed
you are no longer on hand
that is well you have wished to release the people from royalty and you deliver over your daughters to the police
friends have a care have mercy
women unhappy women we are not in the habit of bestowing much thou but on them
we trust to the women not having received a man's education we prevent their reading we prevent their thinking we prevent their occupying themselves with politics will you prevent them from going to the dead house this evening and recognizing your movies
let us see those who have families must be tractable and shake hands with us and take themselves off and leave us here alone to attend to this affair
i know well that courage is required to leave that it is hard but the harder it is the more meritorious
you say' i have a gun i am at the barricade so much the worse i shall remain there
' so much the worse is easily said
my friends there is a morrow you will not be here tomorrow but your families will and what sufferings
see here is a pretty healthy child with cheeks like an apple who babbles prattle's chatters who laughs who smells sweet beneath your kids and do you know what becomes of him when he is abandoned
i have seen one a very small creature no taller than that
his father was dead
poor people had taken him in out of charity but they had bread only for themselves
the child was always hungry
it was winter
he did not cry
you could see him approach the stove in which there was never any fire and whose pipe you know was of mastic and yellow clay
his breathing was hoarse his face livid his limbs flaccid his belly prominent
he said nothing
if you spoke to him he did not answer
he is dead
he was taken to the becker hospital where i saw him
i was house surgeon in that hospital
now if there are any fathers among you gathers whose happiness it is to stroll on sundays holding their child's tiny hand in their robust handle teach one of those fathers imagine that this child is his own
that poor best i remember and i seem to see him now when he lay nude on the dissecting table how his ribs stood out on his skin like the graces beneath the grass in a cemetery
a sort of mud was found in his stomach
there we reached in his teeth
come let us examine ourselves conscientiously and take counsel with our heart
statistics show that the mortality among abandoned children is fifty five percent
i repeat it is a question of women it concerns mothers it concerns young girls it concerns little children
who is talking to you of yourselves
we know well what you are we know well that you are all brave par bleu
we know well that you all have in your souls the joy and the glory of giving your life for the great cause we know well that you feel yourselves elected to die usefully and magnificently and that each one of you clings to his share in the triumph
very well
but you are not alone in this world
there are other beings of whom you must think
you must not been lists
all dropped their heads with a gloomy air
strange contradictions of the human heart at its most sublime moments
com be ferre who spoke thus was not an orphan
he recalled the mothers of other men and forgot his own
he was about to get himself killed
he was an egoist
marius fasting fevered having emerged in succession from all hope and having been stranded in gg use the most sombre of shipwrecks and saturated with violent emotions and conscious that the end was near had plunged deeper and deeper into that visionary stupor which always preceded the fatal your voluntarily accepted
a physiologist might have studied in him the growing symptoms of that febrile absorption known to and classified by science and which is to suffering what voluptuousness is to pleasure
despair also has its ecstacy
marius had reached this point
he looked on at everything as from without as we have said things which passed before him seemed far away he made out the whole but did not perceive the details
he beheld men going and coming as through a flame
he heard voices speaking as at the bottom of an abyss
but this moved him
there was in this scene a point which pierced and roused even him
he had but one idea how to die and he did not wish to be turned aside from it but he reflected in his gloomy zomba mb ukiah that while destroying himself he was not prohibited from saving someone else
he raised his voice
enjoi gas and comb ever read wright said he no unnecessary sacrifice
i join them and you must make haste
don feder re has said convincing things to you
there are some among you who have families mothers sisters wives children
let such leave the ranks
no one stirred
married men and the supporters of families step out of the banks
repeated marius
his authority was great
enjo iraq was certainly the head of the barricade but marius was it's savior
i order it frieden no less
i entreat you said marius
then touched by combe ferre's words shaken by em hold as' order touched by marius' entreaty these heroic men began to denounce each other
it is true said one young man to a full grown man you are the father of a family
go
it is your duty rather retorted the man you have two sisters whom you maintain
and an unprecedented controversy broke forth
each struggled to determine which should not allow himself to be placed at the door of the tomb
make haste said source trac in another quarter of an hour it will be too late
citizens pursued em hold as this is the republic and universal suffrage reigns
do you yourselves designate those who are to go
they obeyed
after the expiration of a few minutes five were unanimously selected and stepped out of the ranks
there are five of them
exclaimed marius
there were only four uniforms
well began the five one must stay behind
and then a struggle arose as to who should remain and who should find reasons for the others not remaining
the generous quarrel began a fresh
you have a wife who loves you
you have your aged mother
you have neither father nor mother and what is to become of your three little brothers
you are the father of five children
you have a right to life you are only seventeen it is too early for you to die
these great revolutionary barricades were assembling points for heroism
the improbable was simple there
these men did not astonish each other
re quick repeated source trac
men shouted to marius from the groups do you designate who is to remain
yes said the five choose
we will obey you
marius did not believe that he was capable of another's motion
still at this idea that of choosing a man for death his blood rushed back to his heart
he would have turned pale had it been possible for him to become any paper
he advanced towards the five who smiled upon him and each with his eyes full of that grand flame which one he holds in the depths of history hovering over thermopylae cried to him me
me
ke
and marius stupidly counted them there were still five of them
then his glance dropped to the four uniforms
at that moment a fifth uniform fell as it from heaven upon the other four
the fifth man was saved
marius raised his eyes and recognized m
faux held vent
jean valjean had just entered the barricade
he had arrived by day of monde four lane whither by dint of inquiries made or by instinct or chance
thanks to his dress of a national guardsman he had made his way without difficulty
the sentinel stationed by the insurgents in the rue monde your had no occasion to give the alarm for a single national guardsman and he had allowed the latter to entangle himself in the street saying to himself probably it is a reinforcement in any case it is a prisoner
the moment was too grave to admit of the sentinel abandoning his duty and his post of observation
at the moment when jean valjean entered there doubt no one had noticed him all eyes being fixed on the five chosen men and the four uniforms
jean valjean also had seen and heard and he had silently removed his coat and flung it on the pile with the rest
the emotion aroused was indescribable
who is this man
demanded bosquet
he is a man who saves others replied combe ferre
marius added in a grave voice i know him
this guarantee satisfied everyone
em hold a stunned to jean valjean
welcome citizen
and he added you know that we are about to die
jean valjean without replying helped the insurgent whom he was saving for on his uniform
chapter v. the horizon which one beholds from the summit of a barricade the situation of all in that fatal hour and that pitiless place bad as result and culminating points by olga's' supreme melancholy
enjoi rss bore within him the plenitude of the revolution he was incomplete however so far as the absolute can be so he had too much of saint just about him and not enough of anacharsis floors still his mind in the society of the friends of the abc has ended by undergoing a certain polarization from combed fred's ideas for sometime last he had been gradually emerging from the marrow form of dogma and had allowed himself to incline to the broadening influence of progress and he had come to accept as a definitive and magnificent evolution the transformation of the great french republic into the immense human republic
as far as the immediate means were concerned a violent situation being given he wished to be violent on that point he never varied and he remained of that epic and redoubtable school which is summed up in the words eighty three
enjoi gas was standing erect on the staircase of paving stones one elbow resting on the stock of his gun
he was engaged in thought he quivered as at the passage of prophetic breaths places where death is have these effects of tripods
a sort of stifled fire darted from his eyes which were filled with an inward look
all at once he threw back his head his blond locks fell back like those of an angel on the sombre quadro fx made of stars they were like the mane of a startled lion in the flaming of an halo and enjoi rss cried citizens do you picture the future to yourselves

man nevertheless spread his shares consecrated by intelligence and finally conquered these monsters
we have vanquished the hydra and it is called the locomotive we are on the point of vanquishing the griffon we already grasp it and it is called the balloon
on the day when this promethean task shall be accomplished and when man shall have definitely harnessed to his will the triple chimaera of antiquity the hydra the dragon and the griffin he will be the master of water fire and of air and he will be for the rest of animated creation that which the ancient gods formerly were to him
courage and onward
citizens whither are we going

yes you clearly behold the future yes you are right
you had neither father nor mother re hilly you adopted humanity for your mother and right for your father
you are about to die that is to say to triumph here
citizens whatever happens today through our defeat as well as through our victory it is a revolution that we are about to create
as conflagration slight up a whole city so revolutions illuminate the whole human race
and what is the revolution that we shall cause
i have just told you the revolution of the true
from a political point of view there is but a single principle the sovereignty of man over himself
this sovereignty of myself over myself is called liberty
where two or three of these sovereignties are combined the state begins
but in that association there is no abdication
each sovereignty concedes a certain quantity of itself for the purpose of forming the common right
ghia quantity is the same for all of us
this identity of concession which each makes to all is called equality
common right is nothing else than the protection of all beaming in the right of each
this protection of all over each is called fraternity
the point of intersection of all these assembled sovereignties is called society
this intersection being a junction this point is a knot
hence what is called the social bond
some say social contra ft which is the same thing the word contract being etymologically formed with the idea of a bond
let us come to an understanding about equality for it liberty is the summit equality is the base
equality citizens is not wholly a surface vegetation a society of great blades of grass and tinyos is a proximity of jealousies which render each other null and void legally speaking it is all aptitudes possessed of the same opportunity politically it is all votes possessed of the same weight religiously it is all consciences possessed of the same right
equality has an organ gratuitous and obligatory instruction
the right to the alphabet that is where the beginning must be made
the primary school imposed on all the secondary school offered to all that is the law
from an identical school an identical society will spring
yes instruction

light

citizens the nineteenth century is great but the twentieth century will be happy
then there will be nothing more like the history of old we shall no longer as today have to fear a conquest an invasion a usurpation a rivalry of nations arms inn and an interruption of civilisation r spending on a marriage of kings on a birth in hereditary tyrannies a partition of peoples by a congress a dismemberment because of the failure of a dynasty a combat of two religions meeting face to face like two bucks in the dark on the bridge of the infinite we shall no longer have to bear famine farming out prostitution arising from distress misery from the failure of work and the scaffold and the sword and battles and the ruffian is not chance in the forest of events
one might almost say there will be no more events
we shall be happy
the human race will accomplish its law as the terrestrial globe accomplishes its law harmony will be reestablished between the soul and the star the soil will gravitate around the truth as the planet around the light
friends the present hour in which i am addressing you is a gloomy hour but these are terrible purchases of the future
a revolution is a tool
oh
the human race will be delivered raised up consoles
we affirm it on this barrier
whence should proceed that cry of love if not from the heights of sacrifice
oh my brothers this is the point of junction of those who think and of those who suffer this barricade is not made of paving stones nor of joists nor of bits of iron it is made of two meals a heap of ideas and a heap of woes
here misery meets the ideal
the day embraces the night and says to it' i am about to die and thou shalt be born again with me
' from the embrace of all desolation c faith leaps forth
sufferings bring higher their agony and ideas their immortality
this agony and this immortality are about to join and constitute our death
brothers he who died here dies in the radiance of the future and we are entering a tomball flooded with the dawn
enjoi rss paused rather than became silent his lips continued to move silently as though he were talking to himself which caused them all to gaze attentively at him in the endeavor to hear more
there was no applause but they whispered together for a long time
speech being a breath the rustling of intelligence e resembles the rustling of leaves
chapter vi marius haggard javert laconic let us narrate what was passing ignatius' thoughts
let the reader recall the state of his soul
we have just recalled it everything was a vision to him now
his judgment was disturbed
marius let us insist on this point was under the shadow of the great dark wings which are spread over those in the death agony
he felt that he had entered the tomb it seemed to him that he was already on the other side of the wall and he no longer be held the faces of the living except with the eyes of one dead
how did m
ez uchel event come there
why waste there
what has become there to do
marius did not address all these questions to himself
besides since our despair has this peculiarity that it envelope others as well as ourselves it seemed logical to him that all the world should come thither to doe
only he thought of cosette with a pang at his heart
however m
gauche le vent did not speak to him did not look at him and had not even the air of hearing him when marius raised his voice to say i know him
as far as marius was concerned this attitude of m
fw uchel event was comforting and if such a word can be used for such impressions we should say that it pleased him
he had always felt the absolute impossibility of addressing that enigmatic woman who was in his eyes both equivocal and imposing
moreover it had been a long time since he had seen him and this still further augmented the impossibility for marius' timid and reserved nature
the five chosen men left the barricade by way of monde four lane they bore a perfect resemblance to members of the national guard
one of them wept as he took his leave
before setting out they embraced those who remained
when the five men went back to life had taken their departure any old as thought of the man who had been condemned to death
he entered the tap room
javert still bound to the post was engaged in meditation
do you want anything
enjoi rss asked him
javert replied when are you going to kill me
wait
we need all our cartridges just at present
then give me a drink said javert
em hold as himself offered him a glass of water and ask a vertex epinions she helped him to drink
is that all
inquire den no less
i am uncomfortable against this post replies javert
you are not render to have left me to pass the night here
find me as you please but you surely might lay me out on a table like that other man
and with a motion of the head he indicated the body of m
man eur
there was as the reader will remember along broad table at the end of the room on which they had been running bullets and making cartridges
all the cartridges having been made and all the powder used this table was free
ate my old as' command four insurgents unbound javert from the post
while they were loosing him a fifth held a bayonet against his breast
leaving his arms tied behind his back then placed about his feet a slender burst out shop for dad is done to men on the point of mounting the scaffold which allowed him to take steps about fifteen inches in length and made him walk to the table at the end of the room where they laid him down closely bound about the middle of the body
by way of further sexy ring and by means of a role fastened to his neck they added to the system of ligatures which rendered every attempt at escape impossible that sort of bond which is called in prisons a martingale which starting at the neck forms on the stomach and meets the hands after passing between the legs
while they were binding javert a man standing on the threshold was surveying him with singular attention
the shadow cast by this man made javert turn his head
he raised his eyes and recognized jean valjean
he did not even start but dropped his kids proudly and confined himself to the remark it is perfectly simple
chapter vii the situation becomes aggravated the daylight was increasing rapidly
not a window was opened got a door stood a jar it was the dawn but not the awaking
the end of the rue de la chen berrie opposite the barricade had been evacuated by the troops as we have stated it seemed to be free and presented itself to passersby with a sinister tranquillity
the rue saint denis was as dumb as the avenue of sphinx east themes
not a living being in the crossroads which gleamed white in the light of the sun
nothing is so mournful as this light in deserted streets
nothing was to be seen but there was something to be heard
a mysterious movement was going on at a certain distance
it was evident that the critical moment was approaching
as on the previous evening the sentinels had come in. but this time all had done
the barricade was stronger than on the occasion of the first attack
since the departure of the five they had increased its height still further
on the advice of the sentinel who had examined the region of the halls sanyo or as for fear of a surprise in the fear came to a serious decision
he had the small but of them once your land which had been left open up to that time barricaded
for this purpose they tore up the pavement for the length of several houses more
in this manner the barricade walked on three streets in front on the rue de la chambre due to the left on the rugs dusty means de la petite try and erie to the right on the turn on detour was really almost impregnable it is true that they were fatally hemmed in there
it had three fronts but no exit
a fortress but a rat hole too said court eur as with a laugh
enjoi rashad about thirty paving stones torn up in excess said bosquet piled up near the door of the wine shop
the silence was now so profound in the quarter whence the attack must needs some that enjoi rashad each man resume his post of battle
an allowance of brandy was doled out to each
nothing is more curious than a barricade preparing for an assault
each man selects his place as though at the theatre
they jostle and elbow and crowd each other
there are some who makes halls of paving stones
here is a corner of the wall which is in the way it is removed here is a redan which may afford protection they take shelter behind it
left handed men are precious they take the places that are inconvenient to the rest
many arrange to fight in a sitting posture
they wish to be a tease to kill and to die comfortably
in the sad war of june an insurgent who was a formidable marksman and who was firing from the top of a terrace upon a roof had a reclining chair brought there for his use a charge of grapes not found him out there
as soon as the leader has given the order to clear the decks for action all disorderly movements cease there is no more pulling from one another there are no more coterie's no more asides there is no more holding all of everything in their spirits converges in and changes into a waiting for the assailants
a barricade before the arrival of danger is chaos in danger it is discipline itself
per il produces order
as soon as em hold we had seized his double barrelled rifle and had placed himself in a sort of em measure which he had reserved for himself all the rest held their peace
a series of faint sharp noise are sounded confusedly along the wall of paving stones
it was the men cocking their guns
moreover their attitudes were prouder more confident than ever the excess of sacrifice strengthens they no longer cherishes any hope but they had despair despair the last weapon which sometimes gives victory virgil has said so
supreme resources spring from extreme resolutions
to embark on death is sometimes the means of escaping a shipwreck and the lid of the coffin becomes a plank of safety
as on the preceding evening the attention of all was directed we might almost say leaned up on the end of the street now lighted up and visible
they had not long to wait
a stir began distinctly in the saint leu smarter but it did not resemble the movement of the first attack
a clashing of stains the uneasy jolting of a mass the click of brass skipping along the pavement a sort of spie in uproar announced that some sinister construction of iron was approaching
there arose a tremor in the bosoms of these peaceful old streets pierced and built for the fertile circulation of interests and ideas and which are not made for the horrible rumble of the wheels of war
the fixity of eye in all the combatants upon the extremity of the street became ferocious
a cannon made its appearance
artillery men were pushing the piece it was in firing from the fore carriage had been detached two upheld thehun carriage four were at the wheels others followed with the caisson
they could see the smoke of the burning lint stock
fire
shout even jolt as
the whole barricade fired the report was terrible an avalanche of smoke covered and effaced both canyon and men after a few seconds the cloud dispersed and the cannon and men reappeared the gun crew had just finished filling it slowly correctly without haste into position facing the barricade
not one of them had been struck
then the captain of the piece bearing down upon the breech in order to raise the muzzle began to point the cannon with the gravity of an astronomer levelling a telescope
bravo for the cannon sets
dried now surf
and the whole barricade clapped their hands
a moment later squarely planted in the very middle of the street astride of the gutter the piece was ready for action
a formidable pair of jaws yawner on the barricade
come merrily now
ejaculated courts trac
that's the brutal part of it
after the fill up on the nose the flow from the fish
the army is reaching out its big paw to us
the barricade is going to be severely shaken up
the fusillade tried the cannon takes
it is a piece of eight new model brass added combed free
those pieces are liable to burst as soon as the proportion of ten parts per into one hundred of brass is exceeded
the excess of tin renders them too tender
then it comes to pass that they have caves and chambers when looked at from the vent hole
in order to obviate this danger and to render it possible to force the charge it may become necessary to return to the process of the fourteenth century hopping and to encircle the piece on the outside with a series of un welded steel bands from the breech to the trunnion s
in the meantime they remedy this effect as best they may they manage to discover where the holes are located in the cent of a cannon by means of a searcher
but there is a better method with tribe au val's movable star
in the sixteenth century remarked bosquet they used to rifle cannon
yes replied combe ferre that augments the projectile force but diminishes the accuracy of the firing
in firing at short range the trajectory is not as rigid as could be desired the parabola is exaggerated the line of the projectile is no longer sufficiently rectilinear to allow of its striking intervening objects which is nevertheless a necessity of battle the importance of which increases with the proximity of the enemy and the precipitation of the discharge
this defect of the tension of the surge of the projectile in the rifles cannon of the sixteenth century arise from the smallness of the charge shall charges for that sort of engine are imposed by the ballistic necessities such for instance as the preservation of the gun carriage
in short that despot the cannon can not do all that it desires force is a great weakness
a cannonball only travels six hundred leagues an hour light travels seventy thousand leagues a second
such is the superiority of jesus christ over napoleon
reload your guns said enjoi rss
how was the casing of the barricade going to be made under the cannon balls
would they effects breach
that was the question
while the insurgents were reloading their guns the artillery men were loading the cannon
the anxiety in the're doing was profound
the shots pee the report burst forth
present
shouted a joyous voice
and gave if he flung himself onto the barricade just as the ball washed against it
he came from the direction of the rue du cygne and he had nimbly climbed over the auxiliary barricade which fronted of the labyrinth of the rue de la petite try and erie
gav roche produced a greater sensation in the barricade than the cannonball
the ball buried itself in the mass of rubbish
at the most there was an omnibus wheel broken and the old and say cart was demolished
on seeing this the barricade burst into a laugh
noon
shouted bosquet to the artikler ists
chapter viii the artillery men compel people to take them seriously they blocked round had roche
but he had no time to tell anything
marius drew him aside with a shudder
what are you doing here
hullo
said the child what are you doing here yourself
and he stared at marius intently with his epic effrontery
his eyes grew larger with the proud light within them
it was with an accent of severity that marius continued who told you to come back
did you deliver my letter at the address
gav roche was not without some compunction's in the matter of that letter
in his haste to return to the barricade he had got rid of it rather than delivered it
he was forced to acknowledge to himself that he had confided it rather lightly to that stranger whose face he had not been able to make out
it is true that the kansas bareheaded but that was not sufficient
in short he had been administering to himself little onward remonstrances and he feared marius' reproaches
in order to extricate himself from the predicament he took the simplest course he lied abominably
citizen i delivered the letter to the porter
the lady was asleep
she will have the letter when she wakes up
marius had had two objects in sending that letter to bid farewell to cosette and to save had roche
he was obliged to content himself with the half of his desire
the despatch of his letter and the presence of m
faux jel event in the barricade was a coincidence which occurred to him
he pointed out m
rauch eleventh of abroche
do you know that man
no. said had roche
gav roche had in fact as we have just mentioned seen jean valjean only at night
the troubled and unhealthy conjectures which had outlined themselves in marius' mind were dissipated
did he known
gauche le vent's opinions
perhaps m
faux tel event was a republican
hence his very natural presence in this combat
in the meanwhile gave if he was shouting at the other end of the barricade my gun
source trac had it returned to him
gav roche warned his comrades as he called them that the barricade was blocked
he had had great difficulty in reaching it
a battalion of the lone whose arms were piled in the rue de la petite try and erie was on the watch on the side of the rue du cygne on the opposite side the municipal guard occupied the rue des pres meurs
the bulk of the army was facing them in front
this information given have oct wadded i authorize you to hit' em a tremendous whack
meanwhile en no iraq was straining his ears and watching a thu sembra sure
the assailants dissatisfied no doubt with their shot had not repeated it
a company of infantry of the line had come up and occupied the end of the street behind the piece of ordnance
the soldiers were tearing up the pavement and constructing with the stones a small low walls sort of side work not more than eighteen inches high and facing the barricade
in the angle at the left of those paul ement there was visible the head of the column of a battalion from the suburbs massed in the rue saint denis
en no less on the watch though the distinguished the peculiar sound which is produced when the shells of grapes hot are drawn from the caissons and he saw the commander of the piece change the elevation and incline the mouth of the cannon slightly to the left
then the cannon were began to load the piece
the chief seized the long stock himself and lowered it to the vent
down with your head smug the wall
shouted enjoi gas and all on your knees along the barricade
the insurgents who were straggling in front of the wine shop and who had quitted their posts of combating abroche's arrival rushed of likeli towards the barricade but before em hold as' order could be executed the discharge took place with the terrifying rattle of a round of grapes hot
this is what it was in fact
the charge had been aimed at the cut in the redoubt and had there rebounded from the wall and this terrible rebound had produced two dead and three wounded
if this were continued the barricade was no longer tenable
the grapes not made its way in
a murmur of consternation a rose
let us prevent the second discharges aiden no less
and lowering his rifle he took aim at the captain of the gun who at that moment was bearing down on the breach of his gun and rectifying and definitely fixing it's pointing
the captain of the piece was a handsome sergeant of artillery very young blond with a very gentle face and the intelligent air peculiar to that predestined and redoubtable weapon which by dint of perfecting itself in horror must end in killing war
com be ferre who was standing beside em hold as scrutinized this young man
what a pity
said combe ferre
what hideous things these butcher is safe
come when there are no more kings there will be no more war
em hold as you are taking aim at that sergeant you are not looking at him
fancy he is a charming young man he is intrepid it is evident that he is thoughtful those young artillery men are very well educated he has a father another a family he is probably in love he is not more than five and twenty at the most he might be your brother
he is said enjoi rss
yes replied combe ferrets is mine too
well let us not kill him
let me alone
it must be done
and a year trickled slowly down em hold as' marble cheek
at the same moment he pressed the trigger of his rifle
the flame leaped forth
the artillery man turned round twice his arms extended in front of him his head uplifted as though for breath then he fell with his side on the gun and lay there motionless
they could see his back from the centre of which there flower directly a stream of blood
the ball had traversed his breast from side to side
he was dead
he had to be carried away and replaced by another
several minutes were thus gained in fact
chapter ix employment of the old talents of a poacher and that infallible marksmanship which influenced the condemnation of opinions were exchanged in the barricade
the firing from the gun was about to begin again
against that grapes not they could not hold put a quarter of an hour longer
it was absolutely necessary to deaden the blows
snmp or as issued this command we must place a mattress there
we have none said combe ferre the wounded are lying on them
jean valjean who was seated apart on a stone post at the corner of the tavern with his gun between his knees had up to that moment taken no part in anything that was going on
he did not appear to hear the combatants saying around him here is a gun that is doing nothing
at the order issued by em hold as he rose
it will be remembered that on the arrival of the rabble in the rue de la chambre die an old woman foreseeing the bullets had placed her mattress in front of her window
this window an attic window was on the door of a six story house situated a little beyond the barricade
the mattress placed crosswise supported at the bottom on two poles for drying linen was upheld at the top by two roles which at that distance looked like two threads and which were attached to two nails planted in the window frames
these roles were distinctly visible like hairs against the sky
can someone lend me a double barrelled rifle
said jean valjean
enjoi rss who had just reloaded his handed it to him
jean valjean took aim at the attic window and fired
one of the mattress ropes was cut
the mattress now hung by one thread only
jean valjean fired the second charge
the second rope lashed the panes of the attic window
the mattress slipped between the two poles and fell into the street
the barricade applauded
all voices cried here is a mattress
yes said combe ferre but who will go and fetch it
the mattress has in fact fallen outside the barricade between besiegers and besieged
now the death of the sergeant of artillery having exasperated the troop the soldiers had for several minutes been lying flat on their stomachs behind the line of paving stones which they had erected and in order to supply the forced silence of the piece which was quiet while its service was in course of reorganization they had opened fire on the barricade
the insurgents did not reply to this musketry in order to spare their ammunition the fusillade broke against the barricade but the street which it filled was terrible
jean valjean stepped out of the cut entered the street traversed the storm of bullets walked up to the mattress hoisted it upon his back and returned to the barricade
he placed the mattress in the cut with his own hands
he fixed it there against the wall in such a manner that the artillery men should not see it
that done they awaited the next discharge of grapes hot
it was not long incoming
the cannon vomited forth its package of buckshot with a road
but there was no rebound
the effect which they had foreseen had been attained
the barricade was saved
citizens aiden hold as to jean valjean the republic thanks you
bosquet admired and laughed
he exclaimed it is immoral that a mattress should have so much power
triumph of that which yields over that which strikes with lightning
but never mind glory to the mattress which annuls a cannon
chapter drawn at that moment view the awoke
her chamber was narrow next unobtrusive with a long sash window facing the east on the back courtyard of the house
cosette knew nothing of what was going on in paris
she had not been there on the preceding evening and she had am ready retired to her chamber when toussaint had said it appears that there is a row
cosette had slept only a few hours but soundly
she had had sweet dreams which possibly arose from the fact that her little bed was very white
someone who was marius had appeared to her in the light
she awoke with the sun in her eyes which at first produced on her the effect of being a continuation of her dream
her first thought on emerging from this dream was a smiling one
cosette felt herself thoroughly reassured
like jean valjean she had a few hours previously passed through that reaction of the soul which absolutely will not hear of unhappiness
she began to cherish hole with all her might without knowing why
then she felt a pan get her heart
it was three days since she had seen marius
but she said to herself that he must have received her letter that he knew where she was and that he was so clever that he would find means of reaching her
and that certainly today and perhaps that very morning
it was broad daylight but the rays of light were very horizontal she thought that it was very early but that she must rise nevertheless in order to receive marius
she felt that she could not live without marius and that consequently that was sufficient and that marius would come
no objection was valid
all this was certain
it was monstrous enough aides du to have suffered for three days
marius absent three days this was horrible on the part of the good god
now this cruel teasing from on high had been gone through with
marine was about to arrive and he would bring good news
youth is made thus it quickly dries it's eyes it finds sorrow useless and does not accept it
youth is the smile of the future in the presence of an unknown quantity which is itself
it is natural to it to be happy
it seems as though its respiration were made of hope
moreover cosette could not remember what marius had said to her on the subject of this absence which was to last only one day and what explanation of it he had given her
everyone has noticed with what nimble need a coin which one has dropped on the ground rolls away and hides and with what art it renders itself in discoverable
there are thoughts which play is the same trick they nestle away in a corner of our brain that is the end of them they are lost it is impossible to lay the memory on them
cosette was somewhat vexed at the useless little effort made by her memory
she told herself that it was very naughty and very wicked of her to have forgotten the words uttered by marius
she sprang out of bed and accomplished the two ablutions of soul and body her prayers and her toilet
one may in a case of exigency introduce the reader into a nuptial chamber not into a virginal chamber
verse would hardly venture of prose must not
it is the interior of a flower that is not yet unfolded it is whiteness in the dark it is the private cell of a closer lily which must not be based upon by man so long as the sun has not gazed upon it
woman in the bud is sacred
that innocent bud which opens that adorable male nudity which is afraid of itself that white foot which takes refuge in a slipper that throat which veils itself before a mirror as though a mirror were an eye that chemise which makes haste to rise up and conceal the shoulder for a creaking bit of furniture or a passing vehicle those forest kev those clasps fastened those laces drawn those tremors those shivers of cold and modesty that exquisite affright in every movement that almost winged uneasiness where there is no cause for alarm the successive phases of dressing as charming as the clouds of dawn it is not fitting that all this should be narrated and it is too much to have even called attention to it
the eye of man must be more religious in the presence of the rising of a young girl than in the presence of the rising of a star
the possibility of hurting should inspire an augmentation of respect
the down on the peach then look on the plum the radiated crystal of the show the wing of the butterfly powdered with feathers are coarse compared to that chastity which does not even know that it is chaste
the young girl is only the flash of a dream and is not yet a statue
herbed chamber is hidden in the sombre part of the ideal
the indiscreet touch of a glance brutalized this vague penumbra
here contemplation is profanation
we shall therefore show nothing of that sweet little flutter of cosette's rising
an oriental take relates how the rose was made white by god but that adam looked upon her when she was unfolding and she was ashamed and turned crimson
we are of the number who fall speechless in the presence of young girls and flowers since we think them worthy of veneration
cosette dressed herself very hastily combed and dressed her hair which was a very simple matter in those days when women did not swell out their curls and bands with cushions and puffs and did not put crinoline in their locks
then she opened the window and cast her eyes around her in every direction hoping to see cry some bit of the street an angle of the house an edge of pavement so that she might be able to watch for marius there
but movies of the outside was to be had
the backcourt was surrounded by tolerably high walls and the outlook was only on several gardens
cosette pronounced these gardens hideous for the first time in her life she found flowers ugly
the smallest scrap of the gutter of the street would have met her wishes better
she decided to gaze at the sky as though she thought that marius might come from that quarter
all at once she burst into tears
not that this was fickleness of soul but hopes cut in twain by rejection that was her case
she had a confused consciousness of something horrible
thoughts were rife in the air in fact
she told herself that she was not sure if anything that to withdraw herself from sights as to be lost and the idea that marius could return to her from heaven appeared to her no longer charming but mournful
them as is the nature of these clouds calm returned to her and hope and a sort of unconscious smile which yet indicated trusting of
everyone in the house was still asleep
a country like silence reigned
not a shutter has been opened
the porter's lodge was closed
toussaint had not risen and cosette naturally thought that her father was asleep
she must have suffered much and she must have still been suffering greatly for she said to herself that her father had been unkind but she counted on markus
the eclipse of such a light was decidedly impossible
now and then she heard sharp shocks in the distance and she said it is odd that people should be opening and shutting their carriage gates so early
they were the reports of the cannon battering the barricade
a few feet below rosette's window in the ancient and perfectly black cornice of the wall there was a martin's nest the curve of this next formed a little projection beyond the cornice so that from above it was possible to look into this little paradise
the mother was there spreading her wings like a fan over her brood the father fluttered about flew away then came back bearing in his beak food and kisses
the dawning day gilded this happy thing the great law multiply lay there smiling and august and that sweet mystery unfolded in the glory of the morning
cosette with her hair in the sunlight her soul absorbed in chimeras illuminated by love within and by the dawn without bent over mechanically and almost without daring to a vow to herself that she was thinking at the same time of marius began to gaze at these birds at this family at that male and female that mother and her little ones with the profound trouble which am est produced on a virgin
chapter xi the shot which misses nothing and kills no one the assailants' fire continued
musketry and grapes hot alternated but without committing great ravages to tell the truth
they opal one of the cor in the facade suffered the window on the first floor and the attic window in the roof riddled with buckshot and his cairns were slowly losing their shape
the combatants who had been posted there had been obliged to withdraw
however this is according to the tactics of barricades to fire for a long while in order for stay at the insurgents' ammunition if they commit the mistake of replying
when it is perceive e. from the slackening of their fire that they have no more powder and ball the assault is made
enjoi rashad not fallen into this trap the barricade did not reply
are very discharge by platoon stavros he lifted out his cheek with his tongue a sign of supreme disdain
good for you said he rip up the cloth
we want some linh
source trac called the grapes not to order for the little effect which it produced and said to the cannon you are growing diffuse my goodfellow
one gets puzzled in battle as at a ball
it is probable that this silence on the part of the redoubt began to render the besiegers uneasy and to make them fear some unexpected incident and that they felt the necessity of getting a clear view behind that heap of paving stones and of knowing what was going on behind that impassable wall which received blows without refitting
the insurgents suddenly perceived a helmet fluttering in the sun on a neighboring roof
a fireman had placed his back against a tall chimney and seemed to be acting as sentinel
his glance fell directly down into the barricade
there's an embarrassing watchers aiden no less
jean valjean had returned em hold as' rifle but he had his own gun
without saying a word he took aim at the fireman and a second later the helmet smashed by a bullet rattled noisily into the street
the terrified soldier made haste to disappear
a second observer took his place
this one was an officer
jean valjean who had reloaded his gun took aim at the newcomer and sent the officer's casque to join the soldier's
the officer did not persist and retired speedily
this time the warning was understood
no one made his appearance thereafter on that roof and the idea of spying on the barricade was abandoned
why did you not kill the man
bosquet asked jean valjean
jean valjean made no reply
chapter xii disorder a partisan of order bosquet muttered in combe terre's ear he did not answer my question
he is a man who does good by gunshots said combe terre
those who have preserved some memory of this already distant epoch know that the national guard from the suburbs was valiant against insurrections
it was particularly zealous and intrepid in the days of june
a certain good dram shop keeper of pant index be true or lack netted most establishment had been closed by the riots be cameleon one at the sight of his deserted dancehall and got himself killed to preserve the order represented by a tea garden
in that bourgeois and heroic time in the presence of ideas which had their knight's interests had their paladins
the pro sinews of the originators detracted nothing from the bravery of the movement
the diminution of a pile of crowns made banker's sing the marseillaise
they shed their blood lyrically for the counting house and they defended the shop that immense diminutive of the fatherland with lace daemon lan enthusiasm
at bottom we will observe there was nothing in all this that was not extremely serious
it was social elements entering into strife while awaiting the day when they should enter into equilibrium
another sign of the times was the anarchy mingled with governmental i am the barbarous name of the correct party
people were for order in combination with lack of discipline
the drum suddenly beat capricious calls at the command of such of such a colonel of the national guard such and such a captain sent into action through inspiration auch and such national guardsmen fought for an idea and on their own account
at critical moments of days they took counsel less of their leaders than or their instincts
there existed in the army of order veritable the roller is some of the sword like tannic of others of the pen like henrico need de
civilization unfortunately represented at this epoch rather by an aggregation of interests that by a group of principles was of thought itself in peril it set up the cry of alarm each constituting himself a centre defended its ucc or edit and protected it with his own head and the first comer took it upon himself to save society

a platoon of the national guard would constitute itself on its own authority a private council of war and judge and execute a capture v insurgent in five minutes

a national guard had read the words saint simon in the book and had shouted death
int method june a company of the national guards from the suburbs commanded by the captain ed gnu dot above mentioned had itself decimated in the rue de la chambre die out of caprice and its own good pleasure
this fact singular though it may seem was proved at the judicial investigation opened in consequence of the insurrection of
captain dan his or a bold and impatient bourgeois a sort of condor tiers of the order of those whom we have just characterized a fanatical and intractable government a list could not resist the temptation to find prematurely and the ambition of capturing the barricade alone and unaided that is to say with his company
exasperated by the successive apparition of the red flag and the old coat which he took for the black flag he loudly blamed the generals and chiefs of the corps who were holding council and did not think that the moment for the decisive assault had arrived and who were allowing the insurrection to fry in its own fat to use the celebrated expression of one of them
for his part he thought the barricade ripe and as that which is ripe ought to fall he made the attempt
he commanded men as resolute as himself rating fellows as a witness said
his company the same which had shot jean proud aire the port was the first of the battalion posted at the angle of the street
at the moment when they were least expecting it the captain launched his men against the barricade
this movement executed with more goodwill than strategy cost the tannic of company dear
before it had traversed two thirds of the street it was received by a general discharge from the barricade
four the most audacious who were running on in front were moan down point blank at the very foot of the redoubt and this courageous throng of national guard's very brave men but lacking in military tenacity were forced to fall back after some hesitation leaving fifteen corpses on the pavement
this momentary hesitation gave the insurgents time to reload their weapons and a second and very destructive discharge struck the company before it could regain the corner of the street its shelter
a moment more and it was caught between two fires and it received the volley from the battery piece which not having received the order had not discontinued its firing
the intrepid and imprudent tannic it was one of the dead from this grapes hot
he was killed by the cannon that is today by order
this attack which was more furious than serious irrigated em hold as
the tools
said he
they are getting their own men killed and they are using up our ammunition for nothing
eg hold as spoke like the real general of insurrection which he was
insurrection and repression do not fight with equal weapons
insurrection which is speedily exhausted has only a certain number of shots to fire and a certain number of combatants to expend
and motu cartridge box a man killed can not be replaced
as depression has the army it does not count it's men and as it has vincennes it does not count its shots
depression has as many regiment was the barricade has men and as many arsenals as the barricade has cartridge boxes
thus they are struggles of one against a hundred which always end in crushing the barricade unless the revolution uprising suddenly flings into the balance its flaming archangel's sword
this does happen sometimes
then everything rises the pavements begin to see the popular recounts abound

listen suddenly frieden moira's who was still on the watch it seems to me that paris is waking up
it is certain that on the morning of the th of june the insurrection broke out a fresh for an hour or two to a certain extent
the obstinacy of the alarm peal of saint merry reanimated some fancies
barricades were begun in the rue du poirier and the rue des gra villiers
in front of the ports saint martin a. young man armed with a rifle attacked alone a squadron of cavalry
in plain sight on the open boulevard be placed one knee on the ground shouldered his weapon fired killed the commander of the squadron and turned away saying there's another who will do is no more harm
he was put to the sword
in the rue saint denis a woman fired on the national guard from behind a lowered blind
the slats of the blind could be seen to tremble at every shot
a child fourteen years of age was arrested in the rue de la cosa on erie with his pockets full of cartridges
many posts were attacked
at the entrance to the rue bertin poured a very lively and utterly unexpected fusillade welcomed a regiment of coire assists at whose head marched marshal general cava ignace ebara the
in the rue plan chemin day they threw old pieces of pottery and household utensils down on the soldiers from the roofs a bad sign and when this matter was reported to marshal's oily napoleon's old lieutenant grew thoughtful as he recalled suchet's saying at saragossa we are lost when the old women empty their pots de chambre on our heads
these general symptoms which presented themselves at the moment when it was thought that the uprising had been rendered local this fever of wrath these sparks which flew hither and thither above those deep masses of combustibles which are called the faubourg's of paris all this taken together disturbed the military chiefs
they made haste to stamp out these beginnings of conflagration
they delayed the attack on the barricades main used roach and eerie and saint merry until these sparks had been extinguished in order that they might have to deal with the barricades only and be able to finish them at one blow
columns were thrown into the streets where there was fermentation sweeping the large sounding the small right and left now slowly and cautiously now at full charge
the troops broke in the doors of houses whence shots had been fired at the same time manoeuvres by the cavalry dispersed the group won the boulevards
this repression was not effected without some commotion and without that tumultuous uproar peculiar to collisions between the army and the people
this was what em hold a star caught in the intervals of the cannon are and the musketry
moreover he had seen wounded men passing the end of the street in litters and he said to source trac those sounded do not come from us
their hope did not last long the gleam was quickly eclipsed
in less than half an hour what was in the air vanished it was a flash of lightning unaccompanied by thunder and the insurgents felt that sort of leaden cope which the indifference of the people casts over obstinate and deserted men fall over them once more
the general movement which seemed to have assumed a vague outline had miscarried and the attend ion of the minister of war and the strategy of the generals could now be concentrated on the three or four barricades which still remained standing
the sun was mounting above the horizon
an insurgent hailed enjoi rss

enjoi rss who was still leaning on his elbows at his embr a sure made an affirmative sign with his head but without taking his eyes from the end of the street

bossier was still laughing when source trac exclaimed news
and assuming the tone of an usher making an announcement he added my name is right pounder
in fact and a personage had entered on the scene
this was a second piece of ordnance
the artillery men rapidly performed their manoeuvres in force and placed this second piece in line with the first
this outlined the catastrophe
a few minutes later the two pieces rapidly served were firing point blank at the redoubt the platoon firing of the line and of the soldiers from the suburbs sustained the artillery
another cannon add was audible at some distance
at the same time that the two guns were furiously attacking the redoubt from the rue de la chambre diet do other cannons trained one from the rueda in eden is the other from the eye subrule boucher were fiddling the saint terry barricade
the four cannons echoed each other mournfully
the barking of these sombre dogs of war replied to each other
one of the two pieces which was now battering the barricade in the rue de la chambre did was firing grapes not the other halls
the piece which was firing balls was pointed a little high and the aim was calculated with at the ball struck the extreme edge of the upper crest of the barricade and crumbled the stone down upon the insurgents mingled with bursts of grapes hoy
the object of this more of firing was to drive the insurgents from the summit of the redoubt and to compel them to gather close in the interior that is to say this announced the assault
the combatants once driven from the crest of the barricade by balls and from the windows of the cabaret by grapes not the attacking columns could venture into the street without being picked off perhaps even without being seen would briskly and suddenly scale there doubt as in the preceding evening and who knows
take it by surprise
it is absolutely necessary that the inconvenience of those guns should be diminished said enjoi gas and he shouted fire on the artillery men
all were ready
the barricade which had long been silent poured forth a desperate diff seven or eight discharges followed with a sort of rage and joy the street was filled with blinding smoke and at the end of a few minutes athwart this must all streaked with flame two thirds of the gunners could be distinguished lying beneath the wheels of the cannons
those who were left standing continued to serve the pieces with severe tranquillity but the fire had slackened
things are going well now said bossier to enjoi rss
success
sn no less shook his head and replied another quarter of an hour of this success and there will not be any cartridges left in the barricade
it appears that gave if he overheard this remark
chapter xv had roche outside source trac suddenly caught sight of someone at the base of the barricade outside in the street amid the bullets
tag roche has taken a bottle basket from the wine shop had made his way out through the cut and was quietly engaged in emptying the full cartridge boxes of the national guardsmen who had been killed on the slope if there doubt into his basket
what are you doing there
asked source trac
gav roche raised his face i'm filling my basket citizen
don't you see the grapes hot
garros he replied well it is raining
what then
source trac shouted come in
instant er said had roche
and with a single found he plunged into the street
it will be remembered that can nicky's company had left behind it a trail of bodies
twenty corpses lay scattered here and there on the pavement through the whole length of the street
twenty cartouches for gave if he meant a provision of cartridges for the barricade
the smoke in the street was like a fog
whoever has beheld a cloud which has fallen into a mountain gorge between two leaked escarpments can imagine this smoke rendered denser and thicker by two gloomy rows of lofty houses
it dose gradually and was incessantly renewed hence a twilight which made even the broad daylight turn pale
the combatants could hardly see each other from one end of the street to the other short as it was
this obscurity which had probably been desired and calculated on by the commanders who were to direct the assault on the barricade was useful for abroche
beneath the folds of this veil of smoke and thanks to his small size he could advance tolerably far into the street without being seen
he rifles the first seven or eight cartridge boxes without much danger
he crawled flat on his belly galloped on all fours took his basket in his teeth twisted glided undulated sound from one dead body to another and emptied the cartridge box or cartouche as a monkey opens a nut
they did not dare to shout to him to return from the barricade which was quite near for fear of attracting attention to him
on one body that of a corporal he found a powder flask
for thirst said he putting it in his pocket
by dint of advancing he reached a point where the fog of the fusillade became transparent
so that the sharpshooters of the lone ranger on the outlook behind their paving stone dike and the sharpshooters of the banlieue masses at the corner of the street suddenly pointed out to each other something moving through the smoke
at the moment when gave if he was relieving a sergeant who was lying near a stone door list of his cartridges a bullet struck the body
fichter
ejaculated had roche
they are killing my dead men for me
a second bullet struck a spark from the pavement beside him
a third overturned his basket
gav roche looked and saw that this came from the men of the banlieue
he sprang to his feet stood erect with that air flying in the wind his hands on his hips his eyes fixed on the national guardsmen who were firing and's an honest laos a nanterre men are ugly at nanterrec'est la faites voltaire' tis the fault of voltaire et gets a palais way and will at palaiseauc'est la gauge a rousseau
' tis the fault of rousseau
then he picked up his basket replaced the cartridges which had fallen from it without missing a single one and advancing towards the fusillade set about plundering another cartridge box
there a fourth bullet kissed him again
yafro she sang je ne suis pas not sure i am not a notaryc'est la saute a voltaire' tis the fault of voltaire je suis un petit oiseaui'ma little birdc'est la faites rousseau
' tis the fault of rousseau

' tis the fault of rousseau
thus it denton for some time
it was a charming and terrible sight
ga crochet tough shit at was teasing the fusillade
he had the air of being greatly diverted
it was the sparrow pecking at the sportsmen
to each discharge he retorted with a couple t
they aimed at him constantly and always missed him
the national guardsmen and the soldiers laughed as they took aim at him
he lay down sprang to his feet hid in the corner of a doorway then made a bound disappeared reappeared scampered away returned replied to the grape shot with his thumb at his nose and all the whole went on pillaging the cartouches emptying the cartridge boxes and filling his basket
the insurgents panting with anxiety followed him with their eyes
the barricade trembled he sang
he was not a child he was not a man he was a strange gaming airy
he might have been called the invulnerable dwarf of the fray
the bullets flew after him he was more nimble than they
he played a fearful game of hide and seek with death every time that the flat nosed face of the spectre approached the urchin administered to it a fillip
one bullet however better aimed or more treacherous than the rest finally struck the will o' the wisp of a child
gav roche was seen to stagger then he sank to the earth
the whole barricade gave vent to a cry but there was something of antaeus in that pygmy for the gaming o touch the pavement is the same as for the giant to touch the earth gave if he had fallen only to rise again he remained in a sitting posture along thread of blood streaked his face he raised both arms in the air glanced in the direction whence the shot had come and began to sing je suis tom be pasted rw i have fallen to the earthc'est la faites voltaire' tis the fault of voltaire lends dans le rules eau with my nose in the gutterc'est la faites
' tis the fault if
he did not finish
a second bullet from the same marksman stopped him short
this time he fell face downward on the pavement and moved no more
this grand little soul had taken its flight
chapter xvi now from a brother one becomes a father at that same moment in the garden of the luxembourg for the haze of the drama must be everywhere present two children were holding each other by the hand
one might have been seven years old the other fife
the rain having soaked them they were walking along the paths on the sunnyside the elder was leading the younger they were pale and ragged they had the air of wild birds
the smaller if they said i am very hungry
the elder who was already somewhat of a protector was leading his brother with his left hand and in his right he carried a small stick
they were alone in the garden
the garden was deserted the gates had been closed by order of the police on account of the insurrection
the troops who has been bivouac king there had departed for the exigencies of combat
how did those children come there
perhaps they had escaped from some guard house which stood a jar perhaps there was in the vicinity at the barriersd' enter or on the esplanade del' observatoire or in the neighboring carrefour dominated by the pediment on which could be read in've begun to arch lump annie info out in some mounts bank's booth from which they had fled perhaps they had on the preceding evening escaped the eye of the inspectors of the garden at the hour of closing and had passed the night in some one of those's entry boxes where people read the papers
the fact is they were stray lambs and they seemed free
to be astray and to seem free ie to be lost
these poor little creatures were in fact list
these two children were the same over whom had no she had been put to some trouble as the reader will recollect
children of the the barriers leased out to magnon attributed to m
goole normand and now leaves fallen from all these rootless branches and swept over the ground by the wind
their clothing which had been clean in magnon's day and which had served her as a prospectus with m
rolls norm and had been converted into rays
henceforth these beings belonged to the statistics as abandoned children whom the police take note of collect his lay and find again on the pavements of paris
it requires the disturbance of a day like that to account for these miserable little creatures being in that garden
if the superintendent's had caught sight of them they would have driven cochran's forth
poor little things do not enter public gardens still people should reflect that as children they have a right to flowers
these children were there thanks to the locked gates
they were there contrary to the regulations
they had slipped into the garden and there they remained
closed gates do not dismiss the inspectors oversight is supposed to continue but it grows slack and deposes and the inspectors moved by the public anxiety and more occupied with the outside than the inside no longer glanced into the garden and has not seen the two delinquents
it had rained the night before and even a little in the morning
but in june showers do not count for much
an hour after a storm it can hardly be seen that the beautiful blonde day has dept.
the earth in summer is as quickly dried as the cheek of a child
at that period of the solstice the light of full moon day is so to speak poignant
it takes everything
it applies itself to the earth and superposed itself with a sort of auction
one would say that the sun was thirsty
a shower is but a glass of water a rainstorm is instantly drunk up
in the morning everything was dripping in the afternoon everything is powdered over
nothing is so worthy of admiration as foliage washed by the rain and wiped by the rays of sunlight it is warm freshness
the gardens and meadows having water at their roots and sun in their flowers become per fuming land of incense and smoke with all their odors at once
everything smiles songs and offers itself
one feels gently intoxicated
the springtime is a provisional paradise the sun helps man to have patience
there are beings who demand nothing further mortals who having the azure of heaven say it is enough
dreamers absorbed in the wonderful dipping into the idolatry of nature indifferent to good and evil contemp payors of cosmic and radiantly forgetful of man who do not understand how people can occupy themselves with the hunger of these and the thirst of those with the nudity of the poor in winter with the lymphatic curvature of the little spinal column with the pallet the attic the dungeon and the rate of shivering young girls when they can dream beneath the trees peaceful and terrible spirits they and pitiless it satisfies
strange to say the infinite suffices them
that greatness of man the finite which admits of embrace they ignore
the finite which admits of progress and sublime till they do not think about
the indefinite which is born from the human and divine combination of the infinite and the finite escapes them
provided that they are face to face with immensity they smile
you never ecstasy forever
their life lies in surrendering their personality in contemplation
the history of humanity is for them only a detailed plan
all is not there the true all remains with out what is the use of busting oneself over that detail man
man suffers that is quite possible but look at aldebaran rising
the mother has no more milk the newborn babe is dying
i know nothing about that but just look at this wonderful rosette which a slice of wood cells of the line presents under the microscope
compare the most beautiful mech link add to that if you can
these thinkers forget to love
the zodiac thrives with them to such a point that it prevents their seeing the weeping child
god eclipses their souls
this is a family of mijas which are at once great and petty
horace was one of them so was goethe
la fontaine perhaps magnificent egoiste of the infinite tranquil spectators of sorrow who do not be told her out the weather be fair for whom the sun conceals the funeral pile who would look on at an execution by the guillotine in the search for an effect of light who hear neither the cry nor the song of the death rattle nor the alarm peak for whom everything is well since there is a month of may who so long as there are clouds of purple and gold above their heads declare themselves content and who are determined to be happy until the radiance of the stars and the songs of the birds are exhausted
these are dark radiances
they have no suspicion that they are to be pitied
certainly they are so
he who does not weep does not set
they are to be admired and pitied as one would both pity and admire a being at once night and day without eyes beneath his lashes but with a star on his brow
the indifference of these thinkers is according to come a superior philosophy
that may be but in this superiority there is done infirmity
one may be immortal and yet limp fitness vulcan
one may be more than man and less than man
there is incomplete immensity in nature
who knows whether the sun is not a blind man
but then what
in whom can we trust
so penquisd' isere val di maude at
who shall dare to say that the sun is false
thus certain geniuses themselves certain very lofty mortals man stars may be mistaken
that which is on high at the summit at the crest at the zenith that which sends down so much light on the earth sees but little sees badly see shot at all
is not this a desperate state of things
no
but what is the return above the sun

ont meth of june about eleveno'clock in the morning the luxembourg solitary and depopulated was charming
the quincy n cds and flower beds shed forth balm and dazzling beauty into the sunlight
the branches wild with the brilliant glow of midday seemed endeavoring to embrace
in the sycamores there was an uproar of linnet's sparrow's triumphed woodpeckers climbed along the chestnut trees administering little peck's on the bark
the flower beds accepted the legitimate royalty of the lilies the most august of perfumes is that which emanates from whiteness
the peppery odor of the carnations was precept of pr
the old crow's of marie de medici were amorous in the tall trees
the sun holder em purples set fire to and lighted up the tulips which are nothing but all the varieties of flame made into flowers
all around the banks of tulips the bees the sparks of these flame flowers hummer
all was grace and gayety even the impending rain this relapse by which the lilies of the valley and the honeysuckle's were destined to profit had nothing disturbing about it the swallows indulged in the charming threat of flying low
he who was there aspired to happiness life smelled goodall nature exhaled candor help assistance paternity caress dawn
the thoughts which fell from heaven were as sweet as the tiny hand of a baby when one misses it
the statues under the trees white and nude had robes of shadow pierced with light these goddesses were all tattered with sunlight days hung from them on all sides
around the great fountain the earth was so ready dried up to the point of being burnt
there was sufficient breeze to raise little insurrections of dust here and there
a few yellow leaves leftover from the autumn shaded each other merrily and seemed to be playing tricks on each other
this abundance of light had something indescribably reassuring about it
life sap heat odors overflow'd done was conc cup us beneath creation of the enormous size of the source in all these breaths permeated with love in this interchange of reverberations and reflections in this marvellous expenditure of days in this infinite outpouring of liquid gold one felt the prodigal ity of the inexhaustible and behind this splendid aa behind a curtain of flame one caught a glimpse of god that millionaire of stars
thanks to the same there was not a speck of mud thanks to the gain there was not a grain of ashes
the clumps of blossoms had just been bathed every sort of velvet satin gold and varnish which springs from the earth in the form of el leeds was irreproachable
this magnificence was cleanly
the grand silence of happy nature filled the garden
a celestial silence that is compatible with a thousand sorts of music the coping of nests the buzzing of swarms the fluttering's of the breeze
all the harmony of the season was complete in one gracious while the entrances and exits of spring took place improper order the lilacs ended the jasmine's began some flowers were tardy some once chain advance of their time the vanguard of the red june butterflies frater mixed with the rear guard of the white butterflies of may
the plantain trees were getting their new skins
the breeze hollowed out undulations in the magnificent enormity of the chestnut trees
it was splendid
a veteran from the neighboring barracks who was gazing through the fence said here is the spring presenting arms and in full uniform
all mature was breakfast inn creation was at table this was it's hour the great blue cloth was spread in the sky and the great green cloth on earth the sunlight edit all up brilliantly
god was serving the universal repast
each creature had his pasture or his mess
the ring do've found his hemp seed the chaffinch found his millet the goldfinch found chickweed the red breast roundworms the greenfinch found flies the fly founding us of use the bee found flowers
they are each other somewhat it is true which is the misery of evil mixed with good but not a beast of them all had an empty stomach
the two little abandoned creatures had arrived in the vicinity of the grand fountain and father bewildered by all this light they tried to hide themselves the instinct of the poor and the weak in the presence of eden impersonal magnificence and they kept behind the swans' hutch
here and there at intervals when the wind blew shouts clamor a sort of tumultuous death rattle which was the firing and full blows which were discharges of cannon struck the ear confusedly
smoke hung over the roots in the direction of the halles
abell which had the air of an appeal was ringing on the distance
these children did not appear to notice these noises
the little one repeated from time to time i am hungry
almost at the same instant with the children another couple approached the great basin
they consisted of a good man about fifty years of age who was leading by the hand a little fellow of six
no doubt a father and his son
the little man of such as a big brioche
at that epoch certain houses abutting on the river in the eyes made me and's' enter had keys to the luxembourg garden of which the lodgers enjoyed the use when the gates were shut a privilege which was suppressed later on
this father and son came from one of these houses no doubt
the two poor little creatures watched that gentleman approaching and hid themselves a little more thoroughly
he was a bourgeois
the same person perhaps whom marius had one day heard through his love fever near the same grand basin counselling his son to avoid excesses
he had an affable and haughty air and a mouth which was always smiling since it did not shut
this mechanical chile produced by too much jaw and too little skin shows the teeth rather than the soul
the child with his brioche which he had gotten into but had not finished eating seemed satiated
the child was dressed as a national guardsman owing to the insurrection and the father had remained clad as a bourgeois out of prudence
father and son halted near the fountain where rd use answer exporting
this bourgeois appeared to cherish a special admiration for the swans
he resembled them in this sense that he walked like them
for the moment these answers swimming which is their principal talent and they were superb
if the two poor little beings had listened and if they had been of an age to understand they might have gathered the words of this graveman
the father was saying to his son the save lives content with little
look at me my son
i do not love pomp
i am never seen in clothes decked with gold lace and stones i leave that false splendor to badly organized souls
here the deep shouts which proceeded from the direction of the talked burst out with fresh force of bell and uproar
what is that
inquired the child
the father replied it is the saturn alue
all at once he caught sight of the two little ragged toys behind the green swan hutch
there is the beginning said he
and after a pause he added anarchy is entering this garden
in the meanwhile his son took a bite of his brooches put it out and suddenly burst out crying
what are you crying about
demanded his father
i am not hungry anymore said the child
the father's smile became more accentuated
one does not need to be hungry in order to data cake
my cake tires me
it is stale
don't you want anymore of it
no
the father pointed to the swans
throw it to those palm ipeds
the child hesitated
a person may not want anymore of his cake but that is no reason for giving it away
the father went on be humane
you must have compassion on animals
and taking the cake from his son he flung it into the basin
the cake fell very near the edge
these answers far away in the centre of the basin and busy with some prey
they had seen neither the bourgeois nor the brioche
the bourgeois feeling that the cake was in danger of being wasted and moved by this useless shipwreck entered upon a telegraphic agitation which finally attracted the attention of the swans
they perceived something floating steered for the edge like ships as they are and slowly directed their course toward the brioche with the stupid majesty which befits white creatures
the swan scythes understand signs signed said the bourgeois delighted to make a nest
st that moment the distant tumult of the city underwent another sudden increase
this time it was sinister
there are some gusts of wind which speak more distinctly than others
the one which was blowing at that moment brought clearly defined drum beats clamor's platoon firing and the dismal replies of the tucson and the cannon
this coincided with a black cloud which suddenly veiled the sun
the swans had not yet reached the brioche
let us return home said the father they are attacking the tuileries
he grasped his son's hand again
then he continued from the tuileries to the luxembourg there is but the distance which separates royalty from the peerage that is not far
shots will soon rain down
he glanced at the cloud
perhaps it is rain itself that is about to shower down the sky is joining in the younger branch is condemned
let us return home quickly
i should like to see the swans earth's brio she said the child
the father replied that would be imprudent
and he led his little bourgeois away
the sun regretting the swans turned his head back toward the basin until a corner of the quincy nces concealed it from him
in the meanwhile the two little as it's had approached the brioche at the same time as the swans
it was floating on the water
the smaller of them stared at the cake the elder based after the retreating bourgeois
father and sin entered the labyrinth of walks which leads to the grand flight of steps near the clump of trees in the side of the rue madame
as soon as they had disappeared from view the elder child hastily flung himself flat on his stomach on the founding curb of the basin and clinging to it with his left hand and leaning over the water on the verge of falling in he stretched out his right hand with his stick towards the cake
the swans perceiving the enemy made haste and in so doing they produced an effect of their breasts which was of service to the little fisher the water flowed back before the swans and one of these gentle concentric undulations softly floated the brioche towards the child's wand
just as the swans came up the stick touched the cake
the child gave it a brisk rap drew in the brioche frightened away the swans seized the cake and sprang to his feet
the cake was wet but they were hungry and thirsty
the elder broke the cake into two portions a large one and a small one took the small one for himself gave the large one to his brother and said to him ram that into your muzzle

one thing which must be noted is that the fire which was battering the barricade hardly disturbed the interior
those who have never traversed the whirlwind of this sort of war can form no idea of the singular moments of tranquillity mingled with these convulsions

there doubt of the rue de las hand eerie we repeat seemed very calm within

the position from critical had become menacing and from menacing was probably about to become desperate

chapter xviii the culture become prey we must insist upon one psychological fact peculiar to barricades
nothing which is characteristic of that surprising war of the streets should be omitted
whatever may have been the singular inward tranquillity which we have just mentioned the barricade for those who are inside it remains nonetheless a vision
there is something of the apocalypse in civil war all the mists of the unknown are commingled with fierce flashes revolutions are sphinx es and anyone who has passed through a barricade think she had traversed a dream
the feelings to which one is subject in these places we have pointed out in the case of marius and we shall see the consequences they are both more and less than life
on emerging from a barricade one no longer knows what one has seen there
one has been terrible but one knows it not
one has been surrounded with conflicting ideas which had human faces one's head has been in the light of the future
there were corpses lying prone there and phantoms standing erect
the hours were colossal and seemed hours of eternity
one has lived in death
shadows have passed by
what were they
one has be held hands on which there was blood there was a deafening horror there was also a frightful silence there were open mouths which shouted and other open mouths which held their peace one was in the midst of smoke of night perhaps
one fancied that one had touched the sinister ooze of unknown depths one stares at something red on one's fingernails
one no longer remember's anything
let us return to the rue de la chambre rie
all at once between two discharges the distant sound of a clock striking the hour became audible
it is now day said combe ferre
the twelve strokes had not finished striking when eg hold as sprang to his feet and from the summit of the barricade hurled this thundering shout carry stones up into the houses line the window sills and the roofs with them
half the men to their guns the other half to the paving stones
there is not a minute to be lost
a squad of sappers and miners aaron shoulder had just made their appearance in battle array at the end of the street
this could only be the head of a column and of what column
the attacking column evidently the sappers charged with the demolition of tnf barricade must always precede the soldiers who are to scale it
they were evidently on the brink of that moment which m
clermont tonnerre in called the tug of war
em hold as' order was executed with the correct taste which is peculiar to ships and barricades the only two scenes of combat where escape is impossible
in less than a minute two thirds of the stones which enjoi rashad had piled up at the door of voting he had been carried up to the first floor and the attic and before a second minute had elapsed these stones artistically set one upon the other walked up the sash window on the first floor and the windows in the roof to half their height
a few loopholes carefully planned byte hilly the principal architect allowed of the passage of the gun barrels
this armament of the windows could be effected all the more easily since the firing of grapes not had ceased
the two cannons were now discharging ball against the centre of the barrier in order to make a hole there and if possible a breach for the assault
when the stones destined to the final defence were in place enjoi rashad the bottles which he had set under the table where mabey flag carrier to the first floor
who is to drink that
bossier asked him
they replied enjoi rss
then they barricaded the window below and held in readiness the iron cross bars which served to secure the door of the wine shop at night
the fortress was complete
the barricade was the rampart the wine shop was the dungeon
with the stones which remained they stopped up the outlet
as the defenders of a barricade are always obliged to be sparing of their ammunition and as the assailants know this the assailants combine their arrangements with a sort of irritating leisure expose themselves to fire prematurely though in appearance more than in reality and take their ease
the preparations for attack are always made with a certain methodical deliberation after which the lightning strikes
this deliberation permitted any old as to take a review of everything and to perfect everything
he felt that since such men were to die their death ought to be a masterpiece
he said to marius we are the two leaders
i will give the last orders inside
do you remain outside and observe
marius posted himself on the lookout upon the crest of the barricade
enjoi rashad the door of the kitchen which was the ambulance as the reader will remember nailed up
no splashing of the wounded he said
he issued his final orders in the two room in a curt but profoundly tranquil to here lilly listened and replied in the name of all
on the first floor hold your axes in readiness to cut the staircase
have you then
yes said re hilly
how many
two axes and apple axe
that is good
there are now twenty six combatants of us on foot
how many guns are there
thirty four
eight too many
keep those eight runs loaded like the rest and at hand
swords and pistols in your belts
twenty men to the barricade
six ambushed in the attic windows and at the window on the first floor to fire in the assailants through the loopholes in the stones
let not a single worker remain inactive here
presently when the drum beats the assault let the twenty below stairs rush to the barricade
the first to arrive will have the best places
these arrangements made he turned to javert and said i am not forgetting you
and paying a pistol on the table he added the last man to leave this room will smash the skull of this spy
here
inquired a voice
boletus not mix their corpses with our own
the little barricade of them on detour lane can be scaled
it is only four feet high
the kami seel' opinione d
he shall be taken thither and put to death
there was someone who was more impassive at that moment than em hold as it was javert
here jean valjean made his appearance
he had been lost among the group of insurgents
he stepped forth she said town milf as you are the commander
yes
you thanked me awhile ago
in the name of the republic
the barricade has two saviors marius pont mercy and yourself
do you think that i deserve a recompense
certainly
well i request one
what is it
that i may flow that man's brains out
javert raised his head saw jean valjean made an almost imperceptible movement and said that is just
a store nj old as he had begun to reload his rifle he cut his eyes about him no objections
and he turned to jean valjean take the spy
jean valjean did in fact take possession of javert by seating himself on the end of the table
he seized the pistol and a faint click announced that he has cock edit
almost at the same moment a blast of trumpets became audible
take care
shouted marius from the top of the barricade
javert began to laugh with that noiseless laugh which was peculiar to him and gazing intently at the insurgents he said to them you are in no better case than i am
all out
shout even jolt as
the insurgents poured out tumultuous it and as they went received in the back may we be permitted the expression this sally of javert's we shall meet again shortly
chapter xix jean valjean takes his revenge when jean valjean was left alone with jager the untied the rope which fastened the prisoner across the middle of the body and the knot of which was under the table
after this he made him a sign to rise
javert obeyed with that indefinable smile in which the supremacy of en chained authority is condensed
jean valjean took javert by the martingale as one would take a beast of burden by the breast band and dragging the latter after him emerged from the wine shop slowly because javert with his impeded limbs could take only very short steps
jean valjean had the pistol in his hand
in this manner they crossed the inner trapezium of the barricade
the insurgents all intent on the attack which was imminent had their backs turned to these two
marius alone stationed on one side at the extreme left of the barricade saw them pass
this group of victim and executioner was illuminated by the sepulchral light which he ford in his own soul
jean valjean with some difficulty but without relaxing his hold for a single instant made javert pink ones as he was scale the little entrenchment in the monde four lane
when they had crossed this barrier they found themselves alone in the lane
no one saw them
among the heap they could distinguish am i did face streaming make a pierced hand and the male nude breast of a woman
it was soon one
the corner of the house show them from the insurgents
the corpses carried away from the barricade formed a terrible like a few paces distant
javert based askance at this body and profoundly calm said in a low tone it strikes me that i know that girl
then he turned to jean valjean
jean valjean thrust the pistol under his arm and fixed on javert a look which it requires no words to interpret javert iris i
na very replied take your revenge
jean valjean drew from his pockets knife and opened it
a clasp knife
exclaimed javert you are right
that suits you better
jean valjean cut the martingale which is very bad about his neck then he cut the cords on his wrists then stooping down he cut the cord on his feet and straighten ing himself up he said to him you are free
javert was not easily astonished
still master of himself though he was he could not repress a start
he remained open mouthed and motionless
jean valjean continued i do not think that i shall escape from this place
but if by chance i do i live under the name of gauche le vent in the rue del' homme et memo
jade ryan asked like a tiger which made him half open one corner of his mouth and he muttered between his teeth have a care
go said jean valjean
javert began again thou said strauch eleven true del' homme arms
number
javert repeated in a low voice number
he buttoned up his coat once more resumed the military stiffness between his shoulders made a half turn folded his arms and supporting his chin on one of his hands he set out in the direction of the halles
jean valjean followed him with his eyes a few minutes later javert turned round and shouted to jean valjean you annoy me
kill me rather
javert himself did not notice that he no linger addressed jean valjean as thou
geoff with you said jean valjean
javert retreated slowly
a moment later he turned the corner of the furr's speech eur s
when javert had disappeared jean valjean fired his pistol in the air
then he returned to the barricade and said it is done
in the meanwhile this is what had taken place
marius more intent on the outside than on the interior had not up to that time taken a good look at the pink ones spy in the dark background of the tap room
when he beheld him in broad daylight striding over the barricade in order to proceed to his death he recognized him
something suddenly recurred to his mind
he recalled the inspector of the rue de pontoise and the two pistols which the latter had handed to him and which he marius had used in this very barricade and not only did he recall his face but his name as well
this recollection was misty and troubled however like all his ideas
it was not an affirmation that he made but a question which he put to himself is not that the inspector of police who told me that his name was javert
perhaps there was still time to intervene on behalf of that man
but in the first place he must know whether this was is very
marius called town moira's who had just stationed himself at the other extremity of the barricade enjoi rss
what
what is the name of yonder man
what man
the police agent
do you know his name
of course
he told us
what is it
javert
marius sprang to his feet
at that moment they heard the report of the pistol
jean valjean reappeared and cried it is done
a gloomy chill traversed marius' heart
chapter as the dead are in the right and the living are not in the wrong the death agony of the barricade was about to begin
everything contributed to its tragic majesty at that supreme moment a thousand mysterious crashes in the air the breath of armed masses set in movement in the streets which were not visible the intermittent gallop of cavalry the heavy shock of artillery on the match the firing by squads and the cannon aces crossing each other in the labyrinth of paris the smoked of battle mounting all gilded above the roofs indescribable and vaguely terrible cries lightnings of menace everywhere the tlc son of saint henry which now had the accent sofas of the mildness of the weather the splendor of the sky filled with sun and clouds the beauty of the day and the alarming silence of the houses
for since the preceding evening the two rows of houses in the rue de la chan cherie had become two calls ferocious walls doors closed windows closed shutters closed
in those days so different from those in which we live when the hour was done when the people wished to put an end to a situation which had lasted too long with a charter granted or with a legal country when universal wrath was diffused in the atmosphere when the city consented to the tearing up of the pavements when insurrection made the bourgeoisie smile by whispering it's password in its earthen the inhabitant thoroughly penetrated with the revolt so to speak was the auxiliary of the combatant and the house frater mixed with the improvised fortress which rested on it
when the situation was not ripe when the insurrection was not decidedly admitted when the masses disowned the movement all was over with the combatants the city was changed into a desert around the revolt souls grew chilled refuges were nailed up and the street turned into see tips to help the army to take the barricade
a people can not be forced through surprise to walk more quickly than it chooses
woe to whomsoever tries to force it's hand
a people does not let itself go at random
then it abandons the insurrection to itself
the insurgents become noxious infected with the plague
a house is an escarpment a door is a refusal a facade is a wall
this wall hear safes and will not
it might open and save you
no
this wall is a judge
it gazes at you and condemns you
what dismal things are closed houses
they seem read they are living
life which is as it were suspended there persists there
no one has gone out of them for four and twenty hours but no one is missing from them
in the interior of that rock people go and come go to bed and rise again they are a family party there there they eat and drink they are afraid a terrible thing
fear excuses this fearful lack of hospitality terror is mixed with iran extenuating circumstance
sometimes even and this has been actually seen fear turns to passion bright may change into fury as prudence does into rage hence this wise saying the enraged moderates
there are outbursts of supreme terror whence springs wrath like a mournful smoke
what do these people want
what have they come there to do
let them get out of the scrape
so much the worse for them
it is their fault
they are only getting what they deserve
it does not concern us
here is our poor street all riddled with balls
they are a lack of rascals
above all thingsdon't open the door
and the house assumes the aurora tomb
the insurgent is in the death throes in front of that house he sees the grapes hot and naked sword's drawing near if he cried he knows that they are listening to him and that noone will come the rest and walls which might protect him there are men who might save him and these walls have ears of flesh and these men have bowels of stone
whom shall be reproach
no one and everyone
the incomplete times in which we live
it is always at its own risk and peril that utopia is converted into revolution and from philosophical protest becomes an armed protest and from minerva turns to pallas
the utopia which grows impatient and becomes revolt knows what awaits if it almost always comes too soon
then it becomes designed and stoically accepts catastrophe in lieu of triumph
it serves those who deny it without complaint even excusing the man defend is cuppa tea them and its magnanimity consists in consenting to abandonment
it is indomitable in the face of obstacles and gentle towards ingratitude
is this ingratitude however
yes from the point of view of the human race
no. from the point of view of the individual
progress is man's more of existence
the general life of the human race is called progress the collective stride of the human race is called progress
progress advances it makes the great human and terrestrial journey towards the celestial and the divine it has its halting places where it rallies the laggard troop it has its stations where it meditates on the presence of some splendid canaan suddenly unveiled on its horizon it has its nights when it sleeps and it is one of the poignant anxieties of the thinker that he sees the shadow resting on the human soul and that her roles in darkness without being able to awaken that slumbering progress
god is dead perhaps said gerard de nerval one day to the writer of these lines confounding progress with god and taking the interruption of movement for the death of being
he who despairs is in the wrong
progress infallibly awakes and in short we may say that it marches on even when it is asleep for it has increased in size
when we behold it erect once more we find it taller
to be always peaceful does not depend on progress any more than it does on the stream erect no barriers cast in no boulders obstacles make water froth and humanity boil
hence arise troubles but after these troubles we recognize the fact that ground has been gained
until order which is nothing else than universal peace has been established until harmony and unity reign progress will have revolutions as its halting place s
what then is progress
we have just enunciated of the permanent life of the peoples
now it sometimes happens that the momentary life of individuals offers resistance to the eternal life of the human race
let us admit without bitterness that the individual has his distinct interests and can without forfeiture stipulate for his interest and defend it the present has its pardonable dose of egotism momentary life has its rights and is not bound to sacrifice itself constantly to the future
the generation which is passing in its turnover the earth is not forced to abridge it for the sake of the generations its equal after all who will have their turn later on
i exist murmurs that someone whose name is all
i am young and in love i am old and i wish to repose i am the father of a family it pill prosper i am successful in business i have houses to lease i have money in the government funds i am happy i have a wife and children i have all this i desire to live leave me in peace
hence at certain hours a profound cold broods over the magnanimous vanguard of the human race
utopia moreover we must admit quite it's radiant sphere when it makes war
if the truth of tomorrow borrows its mode of procedure battle from the lie of yesterday
if the future behaves like the past
it pure idea becomes a deed of violence
it complicates it's heroism with a violence ford hist it is just that it should be held his new era violence of occasion and expedient contrary to principle and for which it is fatally punished
the utopia insurrection fights with the old military code in its fist it shoots spies it executes traitors it suppresses living beings and flings them into unknown darkness
it makes use of death a serious matter
it seems as though utopia had no longer any faith in radiance it's irresistible and incorruptible force
it strikes with the sword
now no sword is simple
every blade has two edges he who wounds with the one is wounded with the other
having made this reservation and made it with all severity it is impossible for us not to admire whether they succeed or not those the glorious combatants of the future the confessors of utopia
even when they miscarry they are worthy of generation and it is perhaps in failure that they possess the most majesty
victory when it is in accord with progress merits the applause of the people but a heroic defeat merits their tender compassion
the one is magnificent the other sublime
for our own part we prefer martyrdom to success
john brown is greater than washington and posada he is greater than garibaldi
it certainly is necessary that someone should take the part of the vanquished
we are unjust towards these great men who attempt the future when they fail
revolutionists are accused of sowing fear abroad
every barricade seems a crime
their theories are incriminated their aim suspected their ulterior motive is feared their conscience denounced
they are reproached with raising erecting and healing up against the reigning social states mass of miseries of briefs of iniquities of wrongs of despair sand of hearing from the lowest depths blocks of shadow in order there int len battle themselves and to combat
people shout to them you are tearing up the pavements of hell
they might reply that is because our barricade is made of good intentions
the best thing assuredly is the pacific solution
in short let us agree that when we behold the pavement we think of the bear and it is a goodwill which renders society uneasy
but it depends on society to save itself it is to its own goodwill that we make our appeal
no violent remedy is necessary
to study evil amiably to prove its existence then to cure it
it is to this that we invite it
however that maybe even when fallen above all when fallen these men who are very point of the universe with their eyes fixed in france are striving for the grand work with the inflexible logic of the ideal are august they give their lives free offering to progress they accomplish the will of providence they perform a religious act
at the appointed hour with as much disinterested news as an actor who answers to his cue in obedience to the divine stage manager they enter the tomb
and this hopeless combat this stoical disappearance they accept in order to bring about the supreme and universal consequences the magnificent and irresistibly human movement begun on the th of july these soldiers are priests
the french revolution is an act of god
moreover there are and it is proper to add this distinction to the distinct jobs already pointed out in another chapter there are accepted re volt tions revolutions which are called revolutions there are refused revolutions which are called riots
an insurrection which breaks out is an idea which is passing its examination before the people
if the people lets falls blackball the idea is dried fruit the insurrection is a mere skirmish
waging war at every summons and every time that utopia desired it is not the thing for the peoples
nations have not always and at every hour the temperament of heroes and martyrs
they are positive
a priori insurrection is repugnant to them in the first place because it often results in a catastrophe in the second place because it always has an abstraction as it's point of departure
because and this is a noble thing it is always for the ideal and for the ideal alone that those who sacrifice themselves do this sacrifice themselves
an uncut gestion is an enthusiasm
enthusiasm may was wroth hence the appeal to arms
but every insurrection which aims at a government or a regime aims higher
thus for instance and we insist upon it what the chiefs of the insurrection of and in particular the young enthusiasts of the rue de la chambre roe were combating was not precisely louis philippe
the majority of them when talking free it did justice to this king who stood midway between monarchy and revolution no one hated him
but they attacked the younger branch of the divine right in louis philippe as they had attacked it's elder branch in charles x
and that which they wished to over turn in overturning royalty in france was as we have explained the usurpation of man overman and of privilege over right in the entire universe
paris without a king has as result the world without despots
this is the manner in which they reasoned
their aim was distant no doubt vague perhaps and it retreated in the face of their efforts but it was great
thus it is
and we sacrifice ourselves for the decisions which are almost always illusions for the sacrificed but illusions with which after all the whole of human certainty is mingled
we throw ourselves into these tragic affairs and become intoxicated with that which we are about to do
who knows
we may succeed
we are few it number we have a whole army arrayed against us but we are defending right the natural law the sovereignty of each one over himself from which no abdication is possible justice and truth and in case of need we dislike the three hundred spartans
we do not think of don quixote but of leonidas
and we march straight before us and once pledged we do not draw back and we rush onwards with head held low cherishing as our hope an unprecedented victory revolution completed progress set free again the aggrandizement of the human race universal deliverance and in the event of the worst thermopylae
these passages of arms for the sake of progress often suffer shipwreck and we have just explained why
the crowd is festive in the presence of the impulses of paladins
heavy masses the multitudes which are fragile because of their very weight fear adventures and there is a touch of adventure in the ideal
moreover and we must not forget thus interests which are not very friendly to the ideal and the sentimental are in the way
sometimes the stomach paralyzed the heart
the grandeur and beauty of france lies in this that she takes less from the stomach than other nations she more easily knots the role about her loins
she is the first awake the last asleep
she matches forwards
she is a seeker
this arises from the fact that she is an artist
the ideal is nothing but the culminating point of logic the same as the beautiful is nothing but the summit of the true
artistic peoples are also consistent peoples
top off beauty is to see the light
that is why the torch of europe that is to say of civilization was first borne by greece who passed it into italy who handed it onto france

it is an admirable thing that the poetry of a people is the element of its progress
the amount of civilization is measured by the quantity of imagination
only a civilizing people should remain a manly people
coding by easy bar is no
whoever becomes effeminate makes himself a bastard
he must be neither a dilettante not a virtuoso but he must be artistic
in the matter of civilization he must not refine but he must sublime
on this condition one gives to the human face the pattern of the ideal
the modern ideal has its type in art and its means is science
it is through science that it will realize that august vision of the poet's the social lu beautiful
eden will be reconstructed by a b
at the point which civilization has now reached the exact is a necessary element of the splendid and the artistic sentiment is not only served but completed by the scientific organ dreams must be calculated
act which is the conqueror should have for support science which is the walker the solidity of the creature which is ridden is of importance
the modern spirit is the genius of greece with the genius of india as it's vehicle alexander on the elephant
races which are petrified in dogma or demoralized by lucre are unfit to guide civilization

oftener than is the case with other races issue in the humor for self devotion and sacrifice
only this humor seized upon her and again abandons her
and therein lies the great peril for those who run when she desires only to walk or who walk on when she desires to halt
france has her relapsed into materialism and at certain instants the ideas which obstruct that sublime brain have no longer anything which recalls french greatness and are of the dimensions of a missouri of a south carolina
what is to be done in such a case
the giantess plays at being a dwarf immense france has her dreams of pettiness
that is all
to this there is nothing to say
people's like planets possess the right to an eclipse
and all is well provided that the light returns and that the eclipse does not degenerate into night
dawn and resurrection are synonymous
the reappearance of the light is identical with the persistence of the i
let us state these facts calmly
death on the barricade of the tomb in exile is an acceptable occasion for devotion
the real name of devotion is disinterested ness
let the abandoned allow themselves to be abandoned let the exiled allow themselves to be exiled and let us confine ourselves to entreating great nation's not to retreat too far when they do retreat
one must not push too far in descent under pretext of a return to reason
matter exists the minute exists interest exists the stomach exists but the stomach must not be the sole wisdom
the life of the moment has its rights we admit but permanent life has its rights also
alas
the fact that one is mounted does not preclude a fall
this can be seen in history more frequently than is desirable a nation is great it tastes the ideal then it bites the more and finds it good and if it be asked how it happens that it has abandoned socrates for falstaff it replies because i love statesmen
one word more before returning to our subject the conflict
a battle like the one which we are engaged in describing is nothing else than a convulsion towards the ideal
progress trammel lewis sickly and is subject to these tragic epilepsies
with that malady of progress civil war we have been obliged to come in contact in our passage
this is one of the fatal phases at once a chance gtr' acts of that drama whose pivot is a social condemnation and whose veritable title is progress
progress
the cry to which we frequently give utterance is our whole thought and at the point of this drama which we have now reached the idea which it contains having still more than one trial to undergo it is perhaps permitted to us if not to lift the veil from it to at least allow its light to shine through
the book which the reader has under his eye at this moment is from one end to the other as a whole and in detail whatever maybe its inter mitten few exceptions and faults the march from evil to good from the unjust to the just from night today from appetite to conscience from rottenness to life from hell to heaven from nothingness to god

on the evening before inches at knees the barricade had been approached silently as by a box
now in broad daylight in that widening street surprise was decidedly impossible rude force had moreover been unmasked the cannon had begun the roar the army hurled itself on the barricade
fury now became skill
a powerful detachment of infantry of the line broken at regular intervals by the national guard and the municipal guard in foot and supported by we tried masses which could be heard though not seen debauched into the street at a run with drums beating trumpets braying bayonets levelled the sappers at their head and imperturbable under the projectiles charged straight for the barricade with the weight of a brazen beam against a wall
the wall held firm
the insurgents fired impetuously
the barricade once scale dna damage of lightning flashes
the assault was so furious that for one moment it was inundated with assailants but it shook off the soldiers as the lion shakes off the dogs and it was only covered with besiegers as the cliff is covered with foam to reappear a moment later feet long black and formidable
the column forced to retreat remained massed in the street unprotected but terrible and replied to the redoubt with a terrible discharge of musketry
anyone who had seen fireworks will recall the sheaf formed of inter pacing lightnings which is called a bouquet
let the reader picture to himself this bouquet no longer vertical but horizontal bearing a bullet bucks to torah is cairn at the top of each one of its jets of flame and picking off readme none after another from its clusters of lightning
the barricade was underneath it
on both sides the resolution was equal
the bravery exhibited there was almost barbarous and was complicated with a sort of heroic ferocity which began by the sacrifice of self
this was the epoch when a national guardsman fought like a zouave
the troop wished to make an end of it insurrection was desirous of fighting
the acceptance of the death agony in the flower of youth and in the flush of health turns intrepidity into frenzy
in this fran each one underwent the broadening growth of the death hour
the street was strewn with corpses
the barricade haven no less at one of its extremities and marius at the other
enjoi rss who carried the whole barricade in his head reserved and sheltered himself three soldiers fall one after the other undergo sembra sure without having even seen him marius fought unprotected
he made himself a target
he stood with more than half his body above the breast works
there is no more violent prodigal than the avaricious man who takes the boy in his teeth there is no man more terrible in action than a dreamer
marius was formidable and pensive
in battle he was as in a dream
one would have pronounced him a phantom engaged in hiring a gun
the insurgents' cartridges were giving out but not their sarcasm q
in this whirlwind of the sepulchre in which they stood they laughed
source trac was bareheaded
what have you done with your hat
bossier asked him
source trac replied they have finally taken me away from me with cannon balls
or they uttered naughty comments
can anyone understand exclaimed be jolly bitterly those men and he cited names well known names even celebrated names some belonging to the old army who had promised to join us and taken an oath to aid us and who had pledged their honor to it and who are our generals and who abandon us
and bombed were restricted himself to replying with a grave smile
there are people who observe the rules of honor as one observes the stars from a great distance
the interior of the barricade was so strewn with torn cartridges that one would have said that there had been a snowstorm
the assailants had numbers in their favor the insurgents had position
they were at the top of a wall and they thundered point blank upon the soldiers tripping over the dead and wounded and entangled in the escarpment
this barricade constructed as it was and admirably buttressed was really one of those situations where a handful of men holds legion in check
nevertheless the attacking column constantly recruited and enlarged under the shower of bullets drew inexorably nearer and how little by little step by step but surely the army closed in around the barricade as the vice grasps the winepress
one assault followed another
the horror of the situation kept increasing
then there burst forth on that heap of paving stones in that rue de la chambred' is a battle worthy of a wall of troy
these haggard ragged exhausted men who had had nothing to eat for four and twenty hours who had not slept who had hit a few more rounds to fire who were fumbling in their pockets which had been emptied of cartridges nearly all of whom were wounded with head of armband aged with black and blood stained linen with holes in their clothes from which the blood trickled and who were hardly armed with poor guns and notched swords became titans
the barricade was ten times attacked approached assailed scaled and never captured
in order to form an idea of this struggle it is mrc essary to imagine fire set to a throng of terrible courage's and then to gaze at the conflagration
it was not a combat it was the interior of a furnace there mouths breathed the flame there countenances were extraordinary
the human form seemed impossible there the combatants flamed forth there and it was formidable to be told the going and coming in that red glow of those salamanders of the fray
the successive and simultaneous scenes of this grand slaughter we renounce all attempts at depicting
the epic alone has the right to fill twelve thousand verses with a battle
one would have pronounced this that hell of brahman is'm the most redoubtable of the seventeen abysses which the veda calls the forest of swords
they fought hand to band foot to boot with pistol shots with blows of the sword with their fists at a distance close at hand from above from below from everywhere from the roots of the houses from the windows of the wine shop from the cellar windows whither some had crawled
they were one against sixty
the facade of cog in the half demolished was hideous
the window tattooed with grapes hot has lost class and frame and was nothing now but a shapeless hole tumultuous it blocked with paving stones
b paquet was killed be holly was killed four be trac was killed com never rr transfixed by three blows from a bayonet on the breast at the moment when he was lifting up a wounded soldier had only time to cast a glance to heaven when he expired
marius still fighting was so riddled with wounds particularly in the head that his countenance disappeared beneath the blood and one would have said that his face was covered with a red kerchief
en no less alone was not struck
when he had no longer any weapon he reached out his hands to right and left and an insurgent thrust some armor other into his fist
all he had left was the stumps of four swords one more than francois k

chapter xxii foot to foot when there were no longer any of the leaders left alive except enjoi gas and marius at the two extremities of the barricade the centre which had so long sustained source track klub issue tee hilly and combed free gave way
the cannon though it had not effected a practicable breach had made a rather large hollow in the middle of there doubt there the summit of the wall had disappeared before the balls and has crumbled away and the rubbish which had fallen now inside now outside had as it accumulated formed two piles in the nature of slopes on the two sides of the barrier one on the inside the other on the outside
the exterior slope presented an inclined plane to the attack
a final assault was there attempted and this assault succeeded
the mass bristling with bayonets and hurled forward at a run came up with irresistible force and these tried front of battle of the attacking column made its appearance through the smoke on the crest of the battlements
this time it was decisive
the group of insurgents who were defending the centre retreated in confusion
then the gloomy love of life awoke once more in some of them
many finding themselves under the muzzles of this forest of guns did not wish to die
this is a moment when the instinct of self preservation emit show is when the beast reappears in men
they were hemmed in by the lofty six story house which formed the background of their redoubt
this house might prove their salvation
the building was barricades and walked as it were from top to bottom
before the troops of the line had reached the interior of there doubt there was time for a door to open and shut the space of a flash of lightning was sufficient for that and the door of that house suddenly opened a crack and closed again instantly was life for these despairing men
behind this house there were streets possible flight space
they set to knocking at that door with the butts of their guns and with kicks shouting calling entreating wringing their hands
no one opened
from the little window on the third floor the head of the dead man gazed down upon them
but enjoi gas and marius and the seven or eight rallied about them sprang forward and protected them
enjoi rashad shouted to the soldiersdon't advance
and as an officer had not obey even hold as had killed the officer
he was now in the little inner court of the redoubt with his back planted against the cor in the building a sword in one hand a rifle in the other holding open the door of the wine shop which he barred against assailants
he shouted to the desperate man there is but one door open this one
and shielding them with his body and facing an entire battalion alone he made them pass in behind him
all precipitated themselves thither
enjoi rss executing with his rifle which he now used like a cane what single stick players walls covered rose round his head levelled the bayonets around and in front of him and was the last to enter and then ensure a horrible moment when the soldiers tried to make their way in and the insurgents strove to bar them out
the door was slammed with such violence that as it fell back into its frame it showed the five fingers of a soldier who had been clinging to it cut off and glued to the post
marius remained outside
a shot had just broken his collarbone he felt that he was fainting and selling
at that moment with eyes already shut he felt the shock of a vigorous hands rising him and the swoon in which his senses vanished hardly allowed him time for the thought mingled with a last memory of cosette i am taken prisoner
i shall be shot
e null rae not seeing marius among those who had taken refuge in the wine shop had the same idea
but they had reached a moment when each man had not the time to meditate on his own death
en no less fixed the bar across the food and bolted it and double locked it with key and chain while those outside were battering furiously at it the soldiers with the butts of their muskets the sappers with their axes
the assailants were grouped about that door
the siege of the wine shop was now beginning
the soldiers we will observe were full of wrath
the death of the artillery sergeant had engaged them and then a still more melancholy circumstance
during the few hours which had preceded the attack it had been reported among them that the insurgents were mutilating their prisoners and that there was the headless body of a soldier in the wine shop
this sort of fatal rumor is the usual accompaniment of civil wars and it was a false report of this kind which later on produced the catastrophe of the tue trans no gain
when the door was barricaded en no less said to the others let us sell our lives dearly
then he approached the table on which lay made it and had roche
beneath the black cloth two straight and rigid forks were visible one large the other small and the two faces were vaguely outlined beneath the cold foods of the shroud
a hand projected from beneath the winding sheet and hung near the floor
it was that of the old man
enjoi rss bent down and kissed that venerable hand just as he had kissed his brow of the preceding evening
these were the only two kisses which he had bestowed in the course of his life
let us abridge the tale
the barricade had fought like a gate of the best he wine shop fought like a house of saragossa
these resistances are dogged
no quarter
no flag of truce possible
men are willing to die provider their opponent will kill them
when such et says capitulate palafox replies after the war with cannon the war with knives
nothing was lacking in the capture by assault of the bush's loup wine shop neither paving stones raining from the windows and the roof of the besiegers and exasperating the soldiers by crushing them horribly not shots fired from the attic windows and the cellar north study of attack nor finally when the door yielded the frenzied madness of extermination
the assailants rushing into the wine shop their feet entangled in the panels of the door which had been beaten in and flung in the ground found not a single combatant there
the spiral staircase been asunder with the a delay in the middle of the tap room a few wounded men were just breathing their last everyone who was not killed was on the first floor and from there through the hole in the ceiling which had formed the entrance of the stairs a terrific fire burst forth
it was the last of their cartridges
when they were exhausted when these formidable men on the point of death had no longer either powder or ball each gras pee in his hands two of the bottles which enjoi rashad reserved age of which we have spoken and held the scaling party in check with these frightfully fragile clubs
they were bottles of aqua fortis
we relate these gloomy incidents of carnage as they occurred
the besieged man alas
converts everything into a weapon
greek fire did not disgrace archimedes boiling pitch did not disgrace bayard
all war is a thing of terror and there is no choice on it
the musketry of the besiegers though confined and embarrassed by being directed from below upwards was deadly
the rim of the hole in the ceiling was speedily surrounded by heads of the slain whence dropped long red and smoking streams the uproar was indescribable a close and burning smoke almost produced night over this combat
words are lacking to express horror when it has reached this pitch
there were no longer men in this conflict which was now internal
they were no longer giants matched with colossi
it resembled hilton and dante rather than homer
demons attacked spectres resisted
it was heroism become monstrous
chapter xxiii orestes fasting and p glades drunk at length by dint of mounting on each other's backs aiding themselves with the skeleton of the staircase climbing up the walls clinging to the ceiling slashing away at the very brink of the trapdoor the last one who offered resistance a score of assailants soldiers national guardsmen municipal guardsmen in utter confusion the majority disfigured by wounds in the face during that redoubtable ascent blinded by blood furious rendered savage made am i eruption into the apartment on the first floor
there they found only one man still on his feet enjoi rss
without cartridges without sword he had nothing in his hand now but the barrel of his gun whose stock he had broken over the head of those who were entering
he had placed the billiard table between his assailants and himself he had retreated into the corner of the room and there with haughty eye and head borne high with this stump of a weapon in his hand he was still so alarming as to speedily create an empty space around him
aceh arose he is the leader
it was he who slew the artillery man
it is well that he has placed himself there
let him remain there
let us shoot him down on the spot
shoot me said enjoi rss
and flinging away his bit of gun barrel and folding his arms he offered his breast
the audacity of a fine death always affects men
as soon as em hold as folded his arms and accepted his end the din of strife ceased in the room and this chaos suddenly drilled into a sort of sepulchral solemnity
the menacing majesty of em hold as disarmed and motionless appeared to oppress this tumult and this young man naughty bloody and charming who alone had not a wound who was as indifferent as an invulnerable being deemed by the authority of his tranquil glance to sinatra in this sinister rabble to kill him respectfully
his beauty at that moment augmented by his pride was resplendent and he was fresh and rosy after the fearful four and twenty hours which had just elapsed as though he could no more be fatigued than wounded
it was of him possibly that a witness spoke afterwards before the council of war there was an insurgent whom i heard called apollo
a national guardsman who had taken a imagen no less lowered his gun saying it seems time that i am about to shoot a flower
twelve men formed into a squad in the corner opposite enjoi gas and silently made ready their guns
then a sergeant shouted takes in
an officer intervened
wait
and addressing en no less so you wish to have your eyes bandaged
no
was it you who killed the artillery sergeant
yes
grant wife had wakes up a few moments before
grant wife it will be remembered had been asleep ever since the preceding evening in the upper room of the wine shops rates on a chair and leaning on the table
be realized in its fullest sense the old metaphor of dead drunk
the hideous potion of absinthe porter and alcohol had thrown him into a lethargy
his table being small and not suitable for the barricade he had been left in possession of it
he was still in the same posture with his breast bent over the table his head lying flat on his arms surrounded by glasses beer mugs and bottles
his was the overwhelming slumber of the torpid bear and the satiated leech
nothing had had any effect upon it neither the fusillade nor the cannon balls nor the grapes hot which has made its way through the window into the room where he was
nor the tremendous uproar of the assault
he merely replied to the cannon are now and then by ashore
he seemed to be waiting there for a bullet which should spare him the trouble of waking
many corpses were strewn around him and at the first glance there was nothing to distinguish him from those profound sleepers of death
noise does not to use a drunken man silence as a kenshin
the fall of everything around him only augmented grant site's prostration the crumbling of all things was his lullaby
the sort of halt which the tumult underwent in the presence of em hold as was a quick to this heavy slumber
it had the effect of a carriage going at full speed which suddenly comes to a dead stop
the person's sizing within it wake up
grant aid arose to his feet with a start stretched out his arms rubbed his eyes stared yawned and understood
writ of drunkenness reaching its end resembles a curtain which is torn away
one behold data single glance and as a whole all that it has concealed
all suddenly presents itself to the memory and the drunkard who has known nothing of what has been taking place during the last twenty four hours has no sooner opened his eyes than he is perfectly informed
ideas recur to him with abrupt lucidity the obliteration of intoxication a sort of steam which has obscured the brain is dissipated and makes way for the clear and sharply outlined importunity of realities
relegated as he was to one corner and sheltered behind the billiard table the soldiers whose eyes were fixed one null rashad not even noticed grant wire and the sergeant was preparing to repeat his order take aim
when all at once they heard a strong voice shout beside them long live the republic
i'm one of them
grant word has risen
the immense gleam of the whole combat which he had missed and in which he had had no part appeared in the brilliant glance of the transfigured drunken man
he repeated long live the republic
crossed the room with a firm stride and placed himself in front of the guns besides my old as
finish both of us at one blow said he
and turning gently town hold as he said to him do you permit it
en moira's pressed his hand with a smile
this smile was not ended when the report resounded
enjoi rss pierced by eight bullets remained leaning against the wall as though the balls bar nailed him there
only his head was bowes
grants i recall at his feet as though struck by a thunderbolt
a few moments later the soldiers dislodged the last remaining insurgents who had taken refuge at the top of the house
they fired into the attic through a wooden lattice
they fought under the very good
they flung bodies some of them still alive out through the windows
two light infantry men who tried to lift the shattered omnibus were slain by two shots fired from the attic
a man in a blouse was flung down from it with a bayonet wound in the abdomen and breathed his last on the ground
a soldier and an insurgent slipped together on the sloping skates of the roof and as they would not release each other they fell clasped in a ferocious embrace
a similar conflict went on in the cellar
shouts shots a fierce trampling
then silence
the bad ricard was captured
the soldiers began to search the houses roundabout and to pursue the fugitives
chapter xxiv prisoner marius was in fact a prisoner
the hand which had seized him from behind and whose grasp he had felt at the moment of his fall and his loss of consciousness was that of jean valjean
jean valjean had taken no other part in the combat than to expose himself in it
had it not been for him no one in that supreme phase of agony would have thought of the wounded
thanks to him everywhere present in the carnage like a providence those who fell were picked up transported to the tap room and cared for
in the intervals here appeared on the barricade
but nothing which could resembles blow an attack or even personal defence proceeded from his hands
he held his peace and lent succor
moreover he had received only a few scratches
the bullets would have none of him
if suicide formed part of what he had meditated on coming to this sepulchre to that soothe had not succeeded
but we doubt whether he had thought of suicide an irreligious act
jean valjean in the thick cloud of the combat did not appear to see marius the truth is that he never took his eyes from the latter
when a shot laid marius low jean valjean leaped forward with the ability of a tiger fell upon him as on his prey and bore him off
the whirlwind of the attack was at that moment so violently concentrated upon enjoi gas and upon the door of the wine shop that no one saw jean valjean sustaining the fainting markus in his arms traverse the unpaved field of the barricade and disappear behind the angle of the dog in the building
the reader will recall this angle which formed a sort of cape on the street it afforded shelter from the bullets the grapes hot and all eyes and a few square feet of space
there is sometimes a chamber which does not burn in the midst of a conflagration and in the jira for ratings was beyond a promontory or at the extremity of a blind alley of shoals a tranquil book
it was in this sort of food in the interior trapezium of the barricade that ep on one has breathed her last
there jean valjean halted let marius spice to the ground placed his back against the wall and cast his eyes about him
the situation was alarming
for an instant for two or three perhaps this bit of wall was a shelter but how waste to escape from this massacre
he recalled the anguish which he had suffered in the rue pol once au eight years before and on what manner he had contrived to make his escape it was difficult then today it was impossible
he had before him that deaf and implacable house six stories in height which appeared to be inhabited only by a dead man leaning out of his window he had on his right the rather low barricade which shut off the rue de la petite try and erie to pass this obstacle seemed easy but beyond the crest of the barriers lots of bayonets was visible
the troops of the line were posted on the watch behind that barricade
it was evident that to pass the barricade was to go inquest of the fire of the platoon and that any year which should run the risk of lifting itself above the top of that wall of stones would serve as a target for sixty store
on his left he had the field of battle
death lurked round the corner of that wall
what was to be done
only a bird could have extricated itself from this predicament
and it was necessary to decide on the instant to devise some expedient to come to some decision
fighting was going on a few paces away fortunately all were rating around a single point the door of the wine shop but if it should occur to one soldier to one single soldier to turn the corner of the house or to attack him on the flank all was over
jean valjean gazed at the house facing him he gazed at the barricade at one side of him then he looked at the ground with the violence of the last extremity bewildered and as though he would have liked to pierce while there with his eyes
by dint of staring something vaguely striking in such an agony began to assume form and outline at his feet as though it has been a power of glance which made the thing desired unfold
a few paces distant he perceived at the base of the small barrier so pitiless it guarded and watched on the exterior beneath a disordered mass of paving stones which partly concealed it an iron grating placed flat and on a level with the soil
this grating made of stout transverse bars was about two feet square
the frame of paving stones which supported it had been torn up and it was as it were unfastened
through the bar davies could be bad of a dark aperture something like the flue of a chimney or the pile of a cistern
jean valjean darted forward
his old art of escape rose to his brain like an illumination
to thrust aside the stones to raise the grating to lift marius who was as inert as a dead body upon his shoulders to descend with this burden on his loins and with the aid of his elbows and knees into that sort of well fortunately not very deep to let the heavy trap upon which the loosened stones rolled down a fresh fall into its place behind him to gain his footing on a flagged surface three metres below the surface all this was executed like that which one does in dreams with the strength of a giant and the rapidity of an eagle this took only a few minutes
jean valjean found himself with marius who was still unconscious in a sort of long subterranean corridor
there reigned profound peace absolute silence night
the impression which he had formerly experienced when falling from the well into the convent recurred to him
only what he was carrying today was not cosette it was marius
he could barely hear the formidable tumult in the wine shop taken by assault like a vague murmur overhead
book second
the intestine of the leviathan chapter i. the land impoverished by the sea paris casts twenty five millions yearly into the water
and this without metaphor

with what object

qty
for no reason
by means of what organ
by means of its intestine
what is it's intestine
the sewer
twenty five millions is the most moderate approximative figure which the valuations of special science have set up on it
science after having long gripes about now knows that the most fecund aging and the most efficacious of fertilizers is human manure
the chinese let us confess it to our shame knew it before us
not a chinese peasant it is eco berg who says this goes to town without bringing back with him at the two extremities of his bamboo pope two full buckets of what we designate as filth
thanks to human dung the earth in china is still as young as on the days of abraham
chinese wheat yields a hundredfold of the seed
there is no guano comparable infertility with the detritus of a capital
a great city is the most mighty of dung makers
certain success would attend the experiment of employing the city to manure the plain
if our gold is manure our manure on the other hand is good
what is done with this golden manure
it is swept into the abyss
fleets of vessels are despatched at great expense to collect the ring of petrels and penguins at the south pole and the incalculable element of opulence which we have ing and we send to the sea
all the human and animal manure which the world wastes restored to the land instead of being cast into the water would suffice to nourish the world
those heaps of filth at the gate posts those tumb role of mud which jolt through the street by night those terrible casks of the street department those fetus drippings of subterranean more which the pavements hide from you do you know what they are
they are the meadow in flower the green grass wild thyme thyme and save they are game they are cattle they are the satisfied fellows of great oxen in the evening they are perfume what they are golden wheat they are the bread on your table they are the warm blood in your veins the yard health they are not they are life
this is the will of that mysterious creation which is transformation on earth and transfiguration in heaven
restore this to the great crucible your abundance will flow forth from it
the nutrition of the plains furnishes the nourishment of men
you have it in your power to lose this wealth and to consider me ridiculous to blog
this will form the masterpiece of your ignorance
statisticians have calculated that france alone makes a deposit of half a hilliard every year on the atlantic through the mouths of her rivers
note this with five hundred millions we could pay one quarter of the expen are of our budget
the cleverness of man is such that he prefers to get rid of these five hundred millions in the gutter
it is the very substance of the people that is carried off here drop by drop there wave after wave the wretched out pour of our sewers into the rivers and the gigantic collection of our rivers into the ocean
every mid south of our sewers costs usaf you want france
from this spring two results the land impoverished and the water tainted
hunger arising from the furrow and disease from the stream
it is notorious for example that at the present hour the thames is poisoning london
so far as paris is concerned it has become indispensable of late to transport the mouths of these were downstream below the last bridge
a double tubular apparatus provided with valves and sluices sucking up and driving back a system of elementary drainage simple as the lungs of a man and which is already in full working order in many communities in england would suffice to conduct the pure water of the fields into our cities and to send back to the fields the rich water of the cities and this easy exchange the simplest in the world would retain among us the five hundred millions now thrown away
people are thinking of other things
the process actually in use does evil with the intention of doing good
the intention is good the result is melancholy
thinking to purge the city the population is blanched like plants raised in cellars
a sewer is a mistake
when drainage everywhere with its double function restoring what it takes shall have replaced the sewer which is a simple impoverish in reaching then this being combined with the data of snow social economy the product of the earth will be increased tenfold and the problem of misery will be singularly lightened
add the suppression of parasitism and it will be solved
in the meanwhile the public wealth blows away to the river and leakage takes place
leakage is the word
europe is being ruined in this manner by exhaustion
as for france we have just cited its figures
now paris contains one twenty fifth of the total population of france and parisian guano being the richest of all we understate the truth when we value the loss on the part of paris at twenty five millions in the half hilliard which france annually rejects
these twenty five millions employed in assistance and enjoyment would double the splendor of paris
the city spends them in sewers
so that we may say that paris's great prodigal it hits wonderful festival its beaumont olly it sorry its stream of gold from full hands its pomp its luxury its magnificence is it's sewer system
it is in this manner that in the blindness of a poor political economy wed down and allow to float downstream and to be lost in the rules the wellbeing of all
there should be nets at saint cloud for the public fortune
economically considered the matter can be summed up this paris is a spendthrift
paris that model with that patron of well arranged capitals of which every nation strives to possess a copy that metropolis of the ideal that august country of the initiative of impulse and of effort that centre and that dwelling of minds that nation city that hive of the future that marvellous combination of babylon and corinth would make a peasant of the fijian shrug his shoulders from the point of view which we have just indicated
imitate paris and you will ruin your selves
moreover and particularly in this immemorial and senseless waste paris is itself an imitator
these surprising exhibitions of stupidity are not novel this is no young folly
the ancients did like the moderns
the sewers of rome says liebig have absorbed all the wellbeing of the roman peasant
when the campagna of rome was ruined by the roman sewer rome exhausted italy and when she had put italy in her sewers help ucsc in sicily then sardinia then africa
the seder of rome has engulfed the world
this cesspool offered its engulf ment to the city and the universe
urbis to rbi
eternal city unfathomable sewer
rome sets the example for these things as well as for others
paris follows this example with all the stupidity peculiar to intelligent towns

chapter iii bruges eau the sewer of paris in the middle ages was legendary
in the sixteenth century henri ii
attempted abode which failed
not a hundred years ago the cesspool mercier attests the fact was abandoned to itself and dated as best it might
such was this ancient paris delivered over to quarrels to indecision and to groping s
it was tolerably stupid for a long time
later on' showed how understanding comes to cities
but in the good old times the capital had not much head
it did not know how to manage its own affairs either morally or materially and could not sweep out filth any better than it could abuses
everything presented an obstacle everything raised a question
the sewer for example was refractory to every itinerary
one could no more find one's bearings in the sewer than one could understand one's position in the city above the unintelligible below the inextricable beneath the confusion of tongues there reigned the confusion of caverns daedalus backed up babel
sometimes the paris sewer took a motion to overflow as though this misunderstood nile were suddenly seized with a bit of rage
there occurred infamous to relate inundation's of the seder
at times that stomach of civilization digested badly the cesspool flower back into the throat of the city and paris for an aftertaste of her own filth
these resemblances of the sewer to remorse had their good points they were warnings very badly accepted however the city waxed indignant at the audacity of its more and did not admit that the filth should return
write it out better
the inundation of ie one of the actual memories of parisians of the age of eighty
the mud spread in cross fork over the place des victoires where stands the statue of louis xiv
it entered the rue saint honore by the two mouths to the sewer in the champs elysees the rue saint florentin through the saint florentin sewer the rue pierre a poisson through the sewer de la sonnerie the rue pop in court through the sewer of the stem invert the rue de la roquette through the sewer of the rue del' alpe it covered the drain of the rue des champs elysees to the height of thirty five centimetres and to the south through the vent of the seine performing its functions in inverse sense it penetrates the rue mazarin e. the rue del' s chaude and the rue des marais where it stopped at a distance of one hundred and nine metres a few paces distant from the house in which was one had lived respecting in the seventeenth century the poet more than the king
it attained its maximum depth in the rue saint pierre where it rose to the height of three feet above the flagstones of the water spout and its maximum length in the rue saint cabin where it spread out over a stretch two hundred and thirty eight metres in length
at the beginning of this century the sewer of paris was still a mysterious place
mud can never enjoy a good game but in this case it's evil renown reached the verge of the terrible
paris knew in a confused way that she had under her a terrible cavern
people talked of it as of that monstrous bed of thebes in which swarmed centipedes fifteen long feet in length and which might have served behemoth for a bathtub
the great bolts of the sewer men never ventured further than certain well known points
we were then very near the epoch when the scavenger's carts from the summit of which sainte food frater mixed with the marquis de few quirks charged their loads directly into the sewer
as for cleaning out that function was entrusted to the pouring rain s which en cum greed rather than swept away
time left some poetry to her sewer and called it the gemini as paris insulted here and entitled of the poly pistols
science and supers to tion were in accord in horror
the poly pistols was no less repugnant to hygiene than to legend
the goblin was developed under the fetid covering of the mou feet are sewer the corpses of the marko users had been cast into these were elana roller i dragon attributed the redoubtable malignant fever or to the great hiatus of the sewer of the marais which remained yawning until in the rue saint louis almost opposite the sign of the gallant messenger
the mouth of the sewer of the rue de la mort elk erie was celebrated for the pestilence's which had their source there with its grating of iron with points simulating a row of terry it was like a dragon's jaw in that fatal street breathing forth help upon men
the popular imagination seasoned the sombre parisian sink with some indescribably hideous inter mixture of the infinite
the sewer had no bottom
these were as the lower world
the idea of exploring these leprous regions did not even occur to the police
to try that unknown thing to cast the plummet into that shadow to set out on a voyage of discover tin they abyss who would have dared
it was alarming
nevertheless someone did present himself
the cesspool has its christopher columbus
one day in during one of the rare apparitions which the emperor made in paris the minister of the interior some decree of crete for other came to the master's intimate levee
in the carrousel there was audible the flanking of swords of all those extra ordinary soldiers of the great republic and of the great empire then napoleon's door was blocked with heroes men from the rhine from the esc aug from the adige and from the nile companions of joubert of de said of marceau of niche of kleber the zeros tiers of fleur is the grenadiers of may ence the pontoon builders of genoa hussars whom the pyramids had looked down upon artikler is tx whom jun it's cannonball had spattered with muddy or assists who had taken by assault the fleet lying at anchor in the sky der zee some had followed bonaparte upon the bridge of lodi others had accompanied murat in the trenches of mantua others had preceded i anne's in the hollow road of montebello
the whole army of that day was present there in the courtyard of the tuileries represented by a squadron of a platoon and guarding napoleon in repose and that was the splendid epoch when the grand army had marengo behind it and austerlitz before it
site said the minister of the interior to napoleon yesterday i saw the most intrepid man in your empire
what man is that
said the emperor brusquely and what has he done
he wants to do something site
what is it
to visit the sewers of paris
this man existed and his name was bruges day
chapter iv bruges day
the visit took place
it was a formidable campaigns nocturnal battle against pestilence and suffocation
it was at the same time a voyage of discovery
one of the survivors of this expedition an intelligent working man who was very young at the time related curious details with regard to it several years ago which bruges eau thought himself obliged to omit in his report to the prefect of police as unworthy of official style
the processes of disinfection were at that epoch extremely rudimentary
hardly had bruges eau crossed the first articulations of that subterranean network when eight laborers out of the twenty refused to do any further
the operation was complicated the visit entailed the necessity of cleaning hence it was necessary to cleanse and at the same time to proceed to note the entrances of water to count the gratings and the vents to lay out in detail the branches to indicate the currents at the point where they parted to define the respective bounds of the divers basins to sound the small sewers grafted on the principal sewer to measure the height under the keystone of each drain and the width at the spring of the vaults as well as at the bottom in order to determine the arrangements with regard to the level of each water entrance either of the bottom of the archos on the soil of the street
they advanced with you l
the lantern spined away in the foul atmosphere
from time to time a fainting sewer man was carried out
at certain points there were precipices
the soil had given away the pavement has crumbled the sewer had changed into a bottomless well they found nothing solid a man disappeared suddenly they had great difficulty in getting him out again
on the advice of four frou they lighted large cages filled with how steeped in resin from time to time in spots which had been sufficiently disinfected
in some places the wall was covered with misshapen fungi one would have said tumors the very stone seemed diseases within this in breathable atmosphere
bruges eau in his exploration proceeded down hill
at the point of separation of the two water conduits of the grand hurley the deciphered upon a projecting stone the date of this shine indicated the limits where philibert delorme charged by henri ii
with visiting the subterranean drains of paris had halted
this stone was the mark of the sixteenth century on the sewer bruges eau found the handiwork of the seventeenth century once more in the ponca audrain of the old due vielle du temple vaulted between and and the handiwork of the eighteenth in the western section of the collecting canal walled and vaulted in
these two vaults especially the less ancient that if we're more cracked and decrepit than the masonry of the belt sewer which dated from an epoch when the crook of freshwater of mr gil montant was elevated to the dignity of the grand fewer of paris an advancement analogous to that if a peasant who should become first valet de chambre to the king something like grosjean transformed into level
here and there particularly beneath the courthouse they thought they recognized the hollows of ancient dungeons excavated in the very sewer itself
hideous place
an iron neck collar was hanging in one of these cells
they walked them all up
some of their funds were singular among others the skeleton of an our an hour an who had disappeared from the jardin des plantes in a disappearance probably connected with the famous and indisputable apparition of the devil in the rue des bernardine in the last year of the eighteenth century
the poor devil has ended by drowning himself in these wed
beneath this long arched drain which terminated at the arche marion a perfectly preserved rag picker's basket excited the admiration of all connoisseurs
everywhere the mire which the sewer men came to handle with intrepidity abounded in previous objects jewels of gold and silver precious stones coins
if a giant had filtered this cesspool he would have had the riches of centuries in his lair
at the point where the two branches of the rue du temple and of the rue saint savoye separate they picked up a singular huguenot medal in copper bearing on one side the pot holder with a car sigal's hat and on the other adolf with a tiara on his head
the most surprising encounter was at the entrance to the grand sewer
this entrance had formerly been closed by a grating of which nothing but the hinges remained
from one of these hinges hung a dirty and shapeless tag which arrested there in its passage no doubt had floated there in the darkness and finished its process of being torn apart
bring stay held his lantern close to this tag and examined it
it was of very fine batiste and in one of the corners less frayed than the rest they made out a heraldic for one hand embroidered above these seven letter slag heap
the crown was the coroner of a marquis and the seven letters sign ified laube spine
they recognized the fact that what they had before their eyes was a morsel of the shroud of marat
marat of his youth had had amorous intrigues
this was when he was a member of the household of the comted' artois in the capacity of physician to the stables
from these love affairs his york daily proved with a great lady he had retained this sheet
as a wai for a souvenir
at his death as this was the only linen of any fineness which he had in his house they buried him in it
some old women had shrouded him for the tomb in that swaddling band in which the tragic friend of the people had enjoyed voluptuous need
bruges eau passed on
they left that ran where i thing they did not put the finishing touch to it
did this arise from scorn or from respect
marat reserved both
and then destiny was there sufficiently stamped to make them hesitate to touch it
besides the things of the sepulchre must be left in the spot which they select
in short there loc was a strange one
a marquise had slept in it maratha drifted in it it had traversed the pantheon to end with the rate of the sewer
this chamber day of which watteau would formerly have joyfully sketched every fold has ended in becoming worthy of the fixed base of dante
the whole visit to the subterranean stream of filth of paris lasted seven years from to
as he proceeded bruges eau drew directed and completed considerable works in he lowered the arch of the pond eau and everywhere creating new line she pushed the sewer in under the rue saint denis as far as the fountain of the innocents in under the rue de old man teak and under the salle frierson under the rue neuve des petits peres under the rue du hall under the rue del' s sharps under the place royale in under the rue de la paix and under the chausseed' anton
at the same time he had the whole network via infected and rendered healthful
in the second year of his work bruges eau engaged the assistance of his son in law margaux
it was thus that at the beginning of the century ancient society cleansed it's double bottom and performed the toilet of its sewer
there was that much clean at all events
tortuous cracked unpaved full of fissures intersected by gullies jolted by eccentric elbows mounting and descending illogically fetus wild fierce submerged in obscurity with cicatrix ecom its pavements and scars on its walls terrible such was retrospectively viewed the antique sewer of paris
ramifications in every direction crossings of trenches branches goose feet stars as in military mines for cum blind alleys vaults lined with salt pet repec tiberius pools scabby sweats in the walls drops dripping from the ceilings darkness nothing could equal the horror of this old waste crypt the digestive apparatus of babylon a cavern ditch gulf pierced with streets a titanic mile burrow where the mind seems to behold that enormous blind mole the past prowling through the shadows in the filth which has been splendor
this we repeat was the sewer of the past
chapter v present progress today the sewer is clean cold straight correct
it almost realizes the ideal of what is understood in england by the word respectable
it is proper and grayish laid out by rule and line one might almost say as though it came out of a band box
it resembles a tradesman who has become a councillor of state
one can almost see distinctly there
the more there's imports of self with decency
at first one might readily mistake it for one of those subterranean corridors which were so common in former days and so useful in flights of monarchs and princes in those good old times when the people loved their kings
the present sewer is a beautiful sewer the pure style reigns there the classical rectilinear alexandrine which driven out of poetry appears to have taken refuge in architecture seems mingled with all the stones of that long dark and whitish vault each outlet is an arcade the rue de rivoli serves as pattern even in the sewer
however if the geometrical line is in place anywhere it is certainly in the drainage trench of a great city
there everything should be subordinated to the shortest road
the sewer has nowadays assumed a certain official aspect
the very police reports of which it sometimes forms the subject no longer are wanting in respect towards it
the words which characterize it in administrative language are sonorous and dignified
what used to be called a guy is now called a gallery what used to be called a hole is now called a surveying orifice
violin would no longer meet with his ancient temporary provisional lodging
this network of cellars has its immemorial population of prowlers rodents swarming in greater nuggets than ever from time to time an aged and veteran rat risks his head at the window of the sewer and surveys the parisians but even these vermin grow take so satisfied are they with their subterranean palace
the cesspool no longer retains anything of its primitive ferocity
the rain which informed days coiled the sewer how each edit
nevertheless do not trust yourself too much to it
miasma's still inhabit it
it is more hypocritical than irreproachable
the prefecture of police and the commission of health have done their best
but in spite of all the processes of disinfection of exhaled a vague suspicious id or like tartuffe after confession
let us confess that taking it all in all this sweeping is a homage which the sewer pays to civilization and as from this point of view tartuffe's conscience is a progress over the augean stables it is certain that the sewers of paris have been improved
it is more than progress it is transmutation
between the ancient and the present sewer there is a revolution
what has effected this revolution
the man whom all the world forgets and whom we have mentioned bruges day
chapter vi future progress the excavation of the sewer of paris has been no slight task
the past ten centuries have toiled at it without being able to bring it to a termination any more than they have been able to finish paris
the sewer in fact receives all the counter shocks of the growth of paris
within the bosom of the earth it is a sort of mysterious polyp with a thousand antennae which expands below as the city expands above
every time that the city cuts a street the sewer stretches out an arm
the old monarchy had constructed only twenty three thousand three hundred metres of sewers that was where paris stood in this respect on the first of january
beginning with this epoch of which we shall shortly speak the work was usefully and energetically resumed and prosecuted napoleon built the figures are curious four thousand eight hundred and four metres louis xviii
five thousand seven hundred and june charles x
ten thousand eight hundred and thirty six louis philippe eighty nine thousand and twenty the republic of twenty three thousand three hundred and eighty one the present government seventy thousand five hundred in all at the present time two hundred and twenty six thousand six hundred and ten metres sixty leagues of sewers the enormous entrails of paris
an obscure ramification ever at works construction which is immense and ignored
as the reader sees the subterranean labyrinth of paris is today more than ten times what it was at the beginning of the century
it is difficult to form any idea of all the perseverance and the efforts which have been required to bring this cesspool to the point of relative perfection in which it now is
it was with great difficulty that the ancient monarchical provost ship and during the last ten years of the eighteenth century the revolutionary mayoralty had succeeded in perforating the five leagues of sewer which existed previous to
all sorts of obstacles hindered this operation some peculiar to the soil others inherent in the very prejudices of the laborious population of paris
paris is built upon a soil which is singularly rebellious to the pick the north shore and to human manipulation
there is nothing more difficult to pierce and to penetrate than the geological formation upon which is superposed the marvellous historical formation called paris as soon as work in any form whatsoever is begun and adventures upon this stretch of alluvium subterranean resistances abound
there are liquid clays springs hard rocks and those soft and deep quagmire's which special science call shout added
the pick advances laboriously through the calcareous layers alternating with very slender threads of clay and sch is to send rain plates in crusted with oyster shells the contemporaries of the press white oceans
sometimes a rivulet suddenly bursts through a fault that has been begun and inundated the laborers or a layer of mark is laid bare and rolls down with the fury of a cataract breaking the stoutest supporting beams like glass
quite recently at gillette when it became necessary to pass the collecting sewer under the saint martin canal without interrupting navigation it emptying the canal a fissure appeared in the basin of the canal water suddenly became abundant in the subterranean tunnel which was beyond the power of the pumping engines it was necessary to send a diver to explore the fissure which had been made in the narrow entrance of the grand basin and it was not without great difficulty that it was stopped up
elsewhere near the seine and even at a considerable distance from the river as for instance at belleville grandeur and lumiere passage quicksand save encountered in which one sticks fast and in which a man sinks visibly
add suffocation by miasma's burial by slides and sudden crumbling of the earth
add the typhus with which the workmen become slowly impregnated
in our own day after having excavated the gallery of clichy with a banquet te to receive the principal water conduit of our css piece of work which was executed in a trench ten metres deep after having in the midst of landslides and with the aid of excavations often putrid and of shoring up vaulted the bird re from the boulevard del' hopital as far as the seine after having in order to deliver paris from the floods of montmartre and in order to provide an outlet for that river like pool nine hectares in extent which crouched near the barriers des martyrs after having let us state constructed the line of sewers from the barriers blanche to the road o father villiers in four months working day and night at a depth of eleven metres after having a thing heretofore unseen made a subterranean sewer in the rue barred' une c without a trench six metres below the surface the superintendent mon not died

there are no bulletins for such acts of bravery as these which are more useful nevertheless than the brutal slaughter of the field of battle
the sewers of paris in were far from being what they are today
bruges eau had given the impulse but the cholera was required to bring about the vast reconstruction which took place later on
it is surprising to say for example that in a part of the belt fewer called the grand canal as in venice still stood stagnating uncovered to the sky in the rue des your des
it was only in that the city of paris found in its pocket the two hundred and sixty thous and eighty france and six centimes required for covering this mass of filth
the three absorbing wells of the combat the dinette and saint hands with their discharging mouths their apparatus their cesspools and their de our story branches only date from
the intestinal sewer of paris has been made over a new and as we have said it has been extended more than ten fold within the last quarter of a century
thigh g years ago at the epoch of the insurrection of the thanet hot june it was still in many localities nearly the same ancient sewer
a very great number of streets which are now convex were then sunken causeways
at the end of a slope where the tributaries of a street or crossroads ended there were often to be seen large square gratings with heavy bags whose iron polished by the footsteps of the throng gleamed dangerous and slippery for vehicles and caused horses to fall
the official language of the roads and bridges have to these gratings the expressive name of cassis
in its number of streets in the rue del' etoile the rue saint louis the rue du temple the rue vielle du temple the rue notre dame de nazareth the eye folie meri court the quai aux fleurs the rue du petit m use the rue du normandie the rue pont aux biches the rue des marais the faubourg saint martin the rue notre dame des victoires the faubourg montmartre the rue grange hate lists in the champs elysees the rue jacob the rue de tough on the ancient gothic sewer still cynically displayed items w
it consisted of enormous voice of stone catch basins sometimes surrounded by stone posts with monumental effrontery
paris in still had nearly the same sewers numerically as stated in five thousand three hundred fathoms
after brun essay on the st. of january it had forty thousand three hundred metres
between and there had been built on an average seven hundred and fifty metres annually afterwards eight and even ten thousand metres of galleries were constructed every year in masonry of small stones with hydraulic mortar which gardens underwater on a cement foundation
at two hundred francs the metre the sixty leagues of paris' sewers of the present day represent forthright millions
in addition to the economic progress which we have indicated at the beginning grave problems of public hygiene are connected with that immense question these sets of paris
paris is the centre of two sheets a sheet of water and's sheer of air
the sheet of water lying at a tolerably great depth underground but already sounded by two nodes is furnished by the layer of green clay situated between the chalk and the jurassic limestone this layer may be represented by a disk five and twenty leagues in circumference a multitude of rivers and brooks ooze there one drinks these inf the marne the tonne the oise the aisne the cher the vienne and the loire in a glass of water from the well of grenelle
the sheet of water is healthy it comes from heaven in the first place and next from the earth theatre hot air is unhealthy it comes from the sewer
all the miasma of the cesspool are mingled with the breath of the city hence this bad breath
the air taken from above ad in the apa's has been scientifically proved is purer than the air taken from above paris
in a given time with the aid of progress mechanisms become perfected and a slug he increases the sheet of water will be employed to purify the sheet of air that is today to wash the sewer
the reader knows that by washing the sewer we mean the restitution of the filth to the earth the return to the soil of dung and of manure to the fields
through this simple act the entire social community will experience a diminution of misery and an augmentation of health
at the present hour the radiation of diseases from paris extends to fifty leagues around the louvre taken as the hub of this is stolen tial wheel
we might say that for ten centuries the cesspool has been the disease of paris
the sewer is the blemish which parish as in her blood
the popular instinct has never been received in it
the occupation of sewer men was formerly almost as perilous and almost as repugnant to the people as the occupation of k. hacker which was so long held in horror and handed over to the executioner
high wages were necessary to induce a mason to disappear in that fetid mine the ladder of the cesspool cleaner hesitated to plunge into it it was said in proverbial form to descend into three weeks to enter the grave and all sorts of hideous legends as we have said covered this colossal sink with terror as read sinkhole which bears the traces of the revolutions of the globe as of the revolutions of man and where are to be found vestiges of all cataclysms from the shells of the deluge to the day of marat
book third
our but the soul chapter i. the sewer and its surprises it was in the sewers or paris that jean valjean found himself
still another resemblance between paris and the sea
as in the ocean the river may disappear there
the transition was an unheard of one
in the very heart of the city jean valjean had escaped from the city and in the twinkling of an eye in the time required to lift the cover and to replace it he had passed from broad daylight to complete obscurity from midday to midnight from tumult to silence from the whirlwind of thunders to the stagnation of the tomb and by a vivid suture far more tremendous even than that of the tiepolo nc eau from the most extreme peril to the most absolute obscurity
an abrupt fall into a cavern a disappearance into the secret trap door of paris to quit that street where death was on every side for that sort of sepulchre where there was life was a strange instant
he remained for several seconds as though bewildered listening stupefied
the waste trap of safety had suddenly yawned beneath him
celestial goodness had in a manner captured him by treachery
adorable am bus cards of providence
only the wounded man did not stir and jean valjean did not know whether that which he was carrying in that grave was a living being or a dead corpse
his first sensation was one of blindness
all of a sudden he could see nothing
it seemed to him too that in one instant he had become deaf
he no longer heard anything
the frantic story of murder which had been let loose a few feet above his head did not reach him thanks to the thickness of the earth which separated him from it as we have said otherwise than faintly and indistinctly and like a rumbling in the depths
he felt that the ground was solid under his feet that was all but that was enough
he extended one arm and then the other touched the walls in both sides and perceived that the passage was narrow he slipped and thus perceived that the pavement was set
he cautiously put forward one foot fearing a hole asino some gulf he discovered that the paving continued
a gust of fetid news informed him of the place in which he stood
after the lapse of a few minutes he was no longer blond
a little light fell through the manhole through which he had descended and his eyes became accustomed to this cavern
he began to distinguish something
the passage in which he had burrowed no other word can better express the situation was walked in behind him
it was one of those blind alleys which the special jargon terms branches
in front of him there was another dallas all like night
the light of the air hole died out ten or twelve paces from the point where jean valjean stood and hardly cast as an pallor of a few metres of the camp walls of the sewer
beyond the opaque news was massive to penetrate thither seemed horrible an entrance into it appeared like an engulf ment
a man could however plunge into that wall of fog and it was necessary soto fl
taste was even requisite
it occurred to jean valjean that the grating which he had caught sight of under the flagstones might also catch the eye of the soldiery and that everything hung up on this chance
they also might descend into that we'll and search it
there was not a minute to be lost
he had deposited marius on the ground he picked him up again that is the real word for it placed him on his shoulders once more and set out
he plunged resolutely into the gloom
the truth is that they were less safe than jean valjean fancied
perils of another sort and no less serious were awaiting them perchance
after the lightning charged whirlwind of the combat the cavern of miasma sand traps after chaos the sewer
jean valjean had fallen from one circle of help into another
when he had advances fifty page she was obliged to halt
a problem presented itself
the passage terminated in another bug which he encountered across his path
there two ways presented themselves
which should be take
ought me to turn to the left or to the right
how waste to find his bearings in that black labyrinth
this labyrinth to which we have already called the reader's attention has a clue which is its slope
to follow to the slope is to arrive at the river
this jean valjean instantly comprehended
he said to himself that he was probably in these were equal les that if he were to choose the path to the left and follow the slope he would arrive in less than a quarter of an hour at some mouth in the seine between the long au change and the pont neuf that is to say he would make his appearance in broad daylight on the most densely people depot in paris
perhaps he would come out on some manhole at the intersection of streets
amazement of the passersby at beholding two bleeding men emerge from the earth at their feet
arrival of the police a call to arms of the neighboring list of guards
thus they would be seized before they had even got out
it would be better to plunge into that labyrinth to confide themselves to that black gloom and to trust to providence for the outcome
he ascended the incline and turned to the right
when he had turned the angle of the gallery the distant glimmer of an air hope disappeared the curtain of obscurity fell upon him once more and he became blind again
nevertheless he advanced as rapidly as possible
marius' two arms were passed round his neck and the former's feet dragged behind him
he held both these arms with one hand and groped along the wall with the other
marius' cheek touched his and clung there bleeding
he felt a warm stream which came from marius trickling down upon him and making its way under his clothes
but a humid warmth near his ear which the mouth of the wounded man touched indicated respiration and consequently life
the passage along which jean valjean was now proceeding was not so narrow as the first
jean valjean walked through it with considerable difficulty
the rain of the preceding day had not as yet entirely runoff and it creates a little torrent in the centre of the bottom and he was forced to hug the wall in order not to have his feet in the water
thus he proceeded in the gloom
he resembled the beings of the night groping in the invisible and lost beneath the earth in veins of shadow
still little by little whether it was that the distant air holes emitted a little wavering light in this opaque gloom of whether his eyes had become accustomed to the obscurity some vague vision returned to him and he began once more to gain a confused idea now of the wall which he touched nos of the vault beneath which he was passing
the pupil dilates in the dark and the soul dilates in misfortune and ends by finding god there
it was not easy to direct his course
the line of the sewer re echoes so to speak the line of the streets which lie above it
there were then in paris two thousand two hundred streets
let the reader imagine himself beneath that forest of gloomy branches which is called the sewer
the system of sewers existing at that epoch place send to end would have given a length of eleven leagues
we have said above that the actual network thanks to the special activity of the last thirty years was no less than sixty leagues in extent
jean valjean began by committing a blunder
he thought that he was beneath the rue saint denis and it was a pity that it was not so
under the rue saint denis there is an old stone sewer which cares from louis xiii
and which runs straight to the collecting sewer called the grand sewer with but a single elbow on the right on the elevation of the ancient sources miracles and a single branch the saint martin sewer whose four arms describe across
but the bit of the petite try and eric the entrance to which was in the vicinity of the cor in the wine shop has never communicated with the sewer of the rue saint denis it ended at the hong kart ds sewer and it was in this that jean valjean was entangled
there opportunities of losing oneself abound
the mo mt martes sewer is one of the most labyrinthine of the ancient network
fortunately jean valjean had left behind him the sewer of the markets whose geometrical plan presents the appearance of a multitude of parrots' roosts piled on top of each other but he had before him more than one embarrassing encounter and more than one street corner for they are streets presenting itself in the gloom like an interrogation point first on his left the vast sewer of the plate ieee a sort of chinese puzzle thrusting out and entangling its chao soft sand as under the post office and under the rotunda of the wheat market as far as these one where it terminates in at secondly on his right the curving corridor of the rue du cadran with its three teeth which are also blind courts thirdly on his left the branch of the mail complicated almost at its inception with a sort of form and proceeding from zigzag to zigzag until it ends in the grand crypt of the outlet of the louvre truncated and ramified in every direction and lastly the blind alley of a passage of the rue des jeune its without counting little ducts here and there before reaching the belt sewer which alone could conduct him to some issue sufficiently distant to be safe
hax jean valjean had any idea of all that we have here pointed out he would speedily have perceived merely by feeling the wall that he was not in the subterranean gallery of the rue saint denis
instead of the ancient stone instead of the antique architecture haughty and royal even in the sewer with pavement and string courses of granite and mortar costing eight hundred livres the fathom he would have felt under his hand contemporary cheapness economical expedients porous stone filled with mortar on a concrete foundation which costs two hundred francs the metre and the bourgeois r masonry known as a petite materia us small stuff but of all this he knew nothing
he advanced with anxiety but with calmness seeing nothing knowing nothing buried in chance that is to say engulfed in providence
by degrees we will admit a certain horror seized upon him
the gloom which enveloped him penetrated his spirit
he walked in an enigma
this aqueduct of the sewer is formidable of interlace sun a dizzy fashion
it is a melancholy thing to be caught in this paris of shadows
jean valjean was obliged to find and even to invent his route without seeing it
in this unknown every step that he risked might be his last
how waste to get out
should be find an issue
should be find it in time
would that colossal subterranean sponge with its stone cavities allow itself to be penetrated and pierced
should be there encounter some unexpected knot in the darkness
should be arrive at the inextricable and the impassable
would marius die thereof hemorrhage and he of hunger
should they end by both getting lost and by furnishing two skeletons in a book of that night
he did not know
he put all these questions to himself without replying to them
the intestines of paris form a precipice
like the prophet he was in the belly of the monster
all at once he had ask for use
at the most unforeseen moment and without having ceased to walk in a straight line he perceived that he was no longer ascending the water of the rivulet was beating against his heels instead of meeting him at his toes
the sewer was now descending
why
waste about to arrive suddenly at the seine
this danger was a great one but the peril of retreating was still greater
he continued to advance
it was not towards the seine that he was proceeding
the ridge which the soil of paris forms on its right bank empties one of its watersheds into the seine and the other into the grand sewer
the crest of this ridge which determines the division of the waters describes a very capricious line
the culminating point which is the point of separation of the currents is in the saints a vote sewer beyond the rue michelle comte in the sewer of the louvre near the boulevards and in the montmartre sewer near the halles
it was this culminating point that jean valjean had reached
he was directing his course towards the belt sewer he was on the right path
but he did not know it
every time that he encountered a branch here profits angles and if he found that the opening which presented itself was smaller than the passage in which he was he did not enter but continued his route rightly judging that every narrower way must needs terminate in a blind alley and could only lead him further from his goal that is to say the outlet
thus be avoided the ama droplet rap which was set for him in the darkness by the four labyrinths which we have just enumerated
at a certain moment he perceived that he was emerging from beneath the paris which was petrified by the uprising where the barricades had suppressed circulation and that he was entering beneath the living and normal paris
overhead he suddenly heard a noise as of thunder distant but continuous
it was the rumbling of vehicles
he had been walking for about half an hour at least according to the calculation which he made in his own mind and he had not yet thought of rest he had merely changed the hand with which he was holding marius
the darkness was more profound than ever but it's very depth reassured him
all at once he saw his shadow in front of him
it was outlined in a faint almost indistinct reddish glow which vaguely em purples the flooring vault under foot and the vault overhead and gilded to his right and to his left the two viscous walls of the passage
stupefied he turned round
behind him in the portion of the passage which he had just passed through at a distance which appeared to him immense piercing the dense obscurity flamed a sort of horrible star which had the air of surveying him
it was the go ii my star of the police which was rising in the sewer
in the rest of that state igbt often forms were moving about in a confused way black upright in distinct horrible
chapter ii explanation on the day of the sixth of june what tue of the sewers had been ordered
it was feared that the vanquished might have taken to them for refuge and prefect tissue teas to search occult paris while general bureaus swept public parks a double and connected operation which exacted a double strategy of the part of the public force represented above by the army and below by the police
three squads of agents and sewer men explored the subterranean drain of paris the first of the right bank the second on the left bank the third in the city
the agents of police were armed with car shines with bludgeon's swords and po innards
that which was directed at jean valjean at that moment was the lantern of the patrol of the right bank
this patrol had just visited the curving gallery and the three blind alleys which lie beneath the rue du cadran
while they were passing their lantern through the depths of these blind alleys jean valjean had encountered on his path the entrance to the gallery had perceived that it was narrower than the principal passage and had not penetrated thither
he had passed on
the police on emerging from the gallery du cadran had fancied that they heard the sound of footsteps in the direction of the belt sewer
they were in fact the steps of jean valjean
the sergeant in command of the patrol had raised his lantern and the squad had begun to gaze into the most in the direction whence the sound proceeded
this was an indescribable moment for jean valjean
happily if he saw the lantern well the lantern saw him but ill
it was light and he was shadow
he was very far off and mingled with the darkness of the place
he hugged the wall and halted
moreover he did not understand what it was that was moving behind him
the lack of sleep and food and his emotions had caused him also to pass into the state of a visionary
he beheld a gleam and around that gleam forms
what was it
he did not comprehend
jean valjean having paused the sound ceased
the men of the patrol listened and heard nothing they looked and saw nothing
they held a consultation
there existed at that epoch at this point of the montmartre sewer a sort of crossroads called de service which was afterwards suppressed on account of the little interior lake which formed there swallowing up the torrent of rain in heavy storms
the patrol could form a cluster in this open space
jean valjean saw these spectres form a sort of circle
these bulldogs' heads approached each other closely and whispered together
the result of this council held by the watchdogs was that they had been mistaken that there had been no noise that it was useless to get entangled in the belt sewer that it would only be a waste of time but that they ought to hasten towards saint merry that if there was anything to do and any housing it to track put it was in that quarter
from time to time parties're so if their old insults
in the word to using it formed the interim be terry the word jacob in which had become obsolete and the word demagogue which has since rendered such excellent service
the sergeant gave orders to turn to the left towards the watershed of the seine
if it had occurred to them to separate into two squads and to go in both directions jean valjean would have been captured
all hung on that thread
it is probable that the instructions of the prefecture foreseeing a possibility of combat and insurgents in force had forbidden the patrol to part company
the patrol resumed its march leaving jean valjean behind it
of all this movement jean valjean perceived nothing except the eclipse of the lantern which suddenly wheeled round
before taking his departure the sergeant in order to acquit his policeman's conscience discharged his gun in the direction of jean valjean
the detonation rolled from echo to echo in the crypt like the rumbling of that titanic eg trail
a bit of plaster which fell into the stream and splashed up the water a few paces away from jean valjean warned him that the ball had struck the arch over his head
slow and measured steps resounded for some time on the timber work gradually dying away as they retreated to a greater distance the group of black forms vanished a glimmer of light oscillated and floated communicating to the fault a reddish glow which grew fainter then disappeared the silence became profound once more the obscurity became complete blindness and deafness resumed possession of the shadows and jean valjean not daring to stir as yet remained for a long time leaning with his back against the wall with a training ears and dilated pupils watching the disappearance of that phantom patrol
chapter iii the spin many his justice must be rendered to the police of that period that even in the most serious public junctures it in perturb ably fulfilled its duties connected with the sewers and surveillance
a revolt was in its eyes no pretext for allowing malefactors to take the bit in their own mouths and for neglecting society for the reason that the government was in peril
the ordinary service was performed correctly in company with the extraordinary service and was not troubled by the latter
in the midst of an incalculable political event already begun under the pressure of a possible revolutions police agents puna those without allowing himself to be distracted by insurrection and barricades
it was something precisely parallel which took place on the afternoon of the thug june on the banks of the seine on the slope of the right shore a little beyond the pont des invalides
there is no longer any bank there now
the aspect of the locality has changed
on that bank two men separated by a certain distance seemed to be watching each other while mutually avoiding each other
the one who was in advance was trying to get away the one in the rear was trying to overtake the other
it was like a game of checkers played at a distance and in silence
neither seemed to be in any hurry and both walked slowly as though each of them feared by too much haste to make his partner redouble his pace
one would have said that it was an appetite following its prey and purposely without wearing the air of doing so
the prey was crafty and on its guard
the proper relations between the hunted polecat and the hunting dog were observed
the one who was seeking to escape had an insignificant mien and not an impressive appearance the one who was seeking to seize him was rude or aspect and must have been rude to encounter
the first conscious that he was the more feeble avoided the second but he avoided him in a manner which was deeply furious anyone who could have observed him would have discerned in his eyes the sombre hostility of flight and all the menace that fear contains
the shore was deserted there were no passersby not even a boatman not a lighter man was in the cliffs which were moored here and there
it was not easy to see these two men except from the quay opposite and to any person who had scrutinized them at that distance the man who was in advance would have appeared like a bristling tattered and equivocal being who was uneasy and trembling beneath dragged blouse and the other like a classic and official parsonage wearing the frock coat of authority buttoned to the chin
perchance the reader might recognize these two men if he were to see them closer at hand
what was the object of the second man
probably to succeed in clothing the first more warmly
when a man clothes by the state pursues a man in rats it is in order to make of him a man who is also clothes by the state
only the whole question lies in the color
to be dressed in blue is glorious to be dressed in red is disagreeable
there is a purple from below
it is probably some unpleasantness and some purple of this sort which the first man is desirous of stirling
if the other allowed him to walk on and had not seized him as yet it was judging from all appearances in the hope of seeing him lead up to some significant meeting place and to some group worth catching
this delicate operation is called spinning
what renders this conjecture entirely probable is that the buttoned up man on catching sight from the shore of a hackney coach on the quay as it was passing along empty made a sigh to the driver the driver understood evidently recognized the person with whom he had to deal turned about and began to follow the two men at the top of the quay at a foot pace
this was not observed by the slouching and tattered personage who was in advance
the hackney coach rolled along the trees of the champs elysees
the bust of the driver ship in hand could be seen moving along above the parapet
one of the secret instructions of the police authorities to their agents contains this article always have on hand a hackney coach in case of emergency
while these two men were manley being each on his own side with irreproachable strategy they approached an inclined plane on the quay which descended to the shore and which permitted cab drivers arriving from passy to come to the river and water their horses
this inclined plane was suppressed later on for the sake of symmetry horses may die of thirst but the eye is gratified
it is probab me that the man in the blouse had intended to ascend this inclined plane with a view to making his escape into the champs elysees a place ornamented with trees but in return much infested with policemen and where the other could easily exercise violence
this point on the quay is not very far distant from the house brought to paris from moreton by colonel brad land designated as the house of francois k
a guard house is situated close at hand
to the great surprise of his watched the man who was being tracked did not mount by the inclined plane for watering
he sony inked to advance along the quay on the shore
his position was visibly becoming critical
what was he intending to do if not to throw himself into the seine
henceforth there existed no means of ascending to the quay there was no other inclined plane no staircase and they were near the spot marked by the bend in the seine towards the pont de jena where the bank growing constantly narrower ended in a slender tongue and was lost in the water
there he would inevitably find himself blocked between the perpendicular well on his right the river on his left and in front of him and the authorities on his heels
it is true that this termination of the shore was hidden from sight by a heap of rubbish six or seven feet in height produced by some demolition or other
but did this man hope to conceal homes of effectually behind that heap of rubbish which one need but skirt
the expedient would have been puerile
he certainly was not dreaming of such a thing
the innocence of thieves does not extend to that point
the pile of rubbish formed a sort of projection at the water's edge which was prolonged in a promontory as far as the fall of the quay
the man who was being followed arrived at this little mound and went round or so that he ceased to be seen by the other
the latter as he did not see could not be seen he took advantage of this fast to abandon all dissimulation and to walk very rapidly
images moment she had reached the rubbish heap and passed round it
there he halted in sheer amazement
the man whom he had been pursuing was no longer there
total eclipse of the man in the blouse
the shore beginning with the rubbish heap was only about thirty pass along then it plunged into the water which beat against the wall of the quay
the fugitive could not have thrown himself into the seine without being seen by the man who was following him
what had become of him
the man in the buttoned up coat walked to the extremity of the shore and remained there in thought for a moment his fists clenched his eyes searching
all at once he smote his brow
he had just perceived at the point where the land came to amend and the water began a large iron grating low arched garnished with a heavy lock and with three massive hinges
this grating a sort of door pierced at the base of the quay opened on the river as well as on the shore
a blackish stream passed under it
this stream discharged into the seine
beyond the heavy rusty iron bars a sort of dark and vaulted corridor could be descried
the man folded his arms and stared at the grating with an air of reproach
as this gaze did not suffice he tried to thrust it aside he shook it it resisted solidly
it is probable that it had just been opened although no sound had been heard a singular circumstance in works by a grating but it is certain that it had been closed again
this indicates that the man before whom that door had just opened had not a book bits key
this evidence suddenly burst upon the kind of the man who was trying to move the grating and evoked from him this indignant ejaculation that is too much
a government key
then immediately regaining his composure he expressed a whole world of interior ideas by this outburst of mono syllables accented all pst ironically come
come
come
come
that said and in the hope of something or other either that he should see them and merge or other men enter he pushed himself on the watch behind a heap of rubbish with the patient rate of a pointer
the hackney coach which regulates all its movements on his had in its turn halted on the quay above him close to the parapet
the coachman foreseeing a prolonged wait encased his horses' muzzles in the bag of oats which is camp at the bottom and which is so familia ftp parisians to whom be it said in parenthesis the government sometimes applied in
the rare passersby in the pont de jeux turned their heads before they pursued their way to take a momentary glance at these two motionless items in the landscape the man on the store the carriage on the quay
chapter if he also bears his cross jean valjean had resumed his march and had not again paused
this march became more and more laborious
the level of these faults varies the average height is about five feet six inches and has been calculated for the statute of a man jean valjean was forced to bend over in order not to strike marius against the vault at every step he had to bend them to rise and to feel incessantly of the wall
the moisture of the stones and the viscous nature of the timber frame work furnished but poor supports to which to cling either for hand or foot
he stumbled alone in the hideous vung heap of the city
the intermittent gleams from the air holes only appeared at very long intervals and were cowan that the full sunlight seemed like the light of the moon all the rest was most miasma opaque news blackness
jean valjean was born hungry and thirsty especially thirsty and this like the sea was a place full of water where a man can not drink
his strength which was prodigious as the reader knows and which had been but little decreased by age thanks to his chaste and sober life began to give way nevertheless
fatigue began to gain on him and as his strength decreased it made the weight of his burden increase
marius who was perhaps dead weighed him down as inert bodies weigh
jean valjean held him in such a manner that his chest was not oppressed and so that respiration could proceed as well as possible
between his legs he felt the rapid gliding of the rate
one of them was frightened to such a degree that he hit him
from time to time a breath of fresh air reached him through the vent holes of the mouths of the sewer and reanimated him
it might have been three hours past midday when he reached the belt sewer
he was at first astonished at this sudden widening
he found himself all at once in a gallery where his outstretched hands could not reach the two walls and beneath a vault which his head did not touch
the grand sewer us in fact eight feet wide and seven feet high
at the point where the montmartre sewer joins the grand sewer two other subterranean galleries that of the rue de provence and that of the abattoir form a square
between these four ways alesse agacious man would have remained undecided
jean valjean selected the broadest that is to say the belt sewer
but here the question again came up should be descend or ascend
he thought that the situation required haste and that he just now gain the seine at any risk
in other terms he must descend
he turned to the left
it was well that he did so for it is an error to suppose that the belt sewer has two outlets the one in the direction of bercy the other toward spacey and that it is as its name indicates the subterranean girdle of the paris on the right bank
the grand sewer which is it must be remembered nothing else than the old brook of msn il montant terminated if one as sends it in a blind sack that is to say at its ancient point of departure which was its source at the foot of the knoll of menlo migrant
there is no direct communication with the branch which collects the waters of paris beginning with the quartier pop in court and which falls into the seine through the ame lot sewer above the ancient isle louviers
this branch which completes the collecting sewer is separated from it under the theme nil montant itself by a pile which marks the dividing point of the waters between upstream and downstream
if jean valjean had ascended the gallery he would have arrived after a thousand efforts and broken down with fatigue and in an expiring condition in the gloom at a wall
he would have been lost
in case of necessity by retracing his steps a little way and entering the passage of the filled du val val from condition that he did not hesitate at the subterranean crossing of the carrefour boucher stand by taking the corridor saint louis then the saint filled but on the left then turning to the right and avoiding the saint sebastian gallery he might have reached the ame lot sewer and thence provided that he did not go astray in the sort of r. which lies under the bastille he might have attained the outlet on the seine near the arsenal
but in order to do this he must have been thoroughly familiar with the enormous haste pore of these are in all its ramifications and in all its openings
now we must again insist that he knew nothing of that frightful drain which he was traversing and has anyone asked him in what he was he would have answered in the night
his instinct served him well
to descend was in fact possible safety
he left on his right the two narrow passages which branch out in the form of a claw under the rue laffitte and the rue saint georges and the long bifurcated corridor of the chausseed' anton
a little beyond an affluent which was probably the madeleine branch he halted
he was extremely weary
a pass a boy large air hole probably the manhole in the rued' anjou furnished a light that was almost vivid
jean valjean with the gentleness of movement which a brother would exercise towards his wounded brother deposited marius on the banquet feof the sewer
marius' blood stained face appeared under the san light of the air hole like the ashes at the bottom of a tomb
his eyes were closed his hair was plastered down on his temples like a painter's brushes dried in red wash his hands hung limp and dead
ac lot of blood had collected in the knot of his cras at his limbs were cold and blood was spotted at the corners of his mouth his shirt had thrust itself into his wounds the cloth of his coat was chafing the yawning gashes in the living flesh
jean valjean pushing aside the garments with the tips of his fingers laid his hand upon marius' breast his heart was still beating
jean valjean tore up his shirt bandaged the young man's sounds as well as he was able and stopped the flowing blood then bending over marius who still lay unconscious and almost without breathing in that half light he gazed at him with inexpressible matter
one is arranging markus' garments he had found two things in his pockets the roll which had been forgotten there on the preceding evening and marius' pocketbook
he ate the roll and opened the pocketbook
on the first page he found the four lines written by marius
the reader will recall them my name is marius pont mercy
carry my body to my grandfather m
ville norm and the des filles du val val reno
in the marais
jean valjean read these four lines by the light of the air hole and remained for a moment as though absorbed in thought repeating in a low tone rue des filles ducal gauge number monsieur ville normand
he replaced the pocketbook in markus' pocket
he had eaten his strength had returned to him he took marius up once more upon his back placed the latter's head carefully on his right shoulder and resumed his descent of the sewer
the grand sewer directed according to the course of the valley of men il montant is about two leagues kong
it is paved throughout a notable portion of its extent
this torch of the names of the streets of paris with which we are illuminating for the reader jean valjean's subterranean march jean valjean himself did not possess
nothing told him what zone of the city he was traversing not what way he had made
only the growing pallor of the pools of light which he encountered from time to time indicated to him that the sun was withdrawing from the pavement and that the day would soon be over and the rolling of vehicles overhead having become intermittent instead of continuous then having almost ceased he concluded that he was no longer under central paris and that he was approaching some solitary region in the vicinity of the outer boulevards of the extreme outer what's
where there are fewer houses and streets the sewer has fewer air holes
the gloom deepened around jean valjean
nevertheless he continued to advance groping his way in the dark
suddenly this darkness became terrible
chapter v in the case of sand as in that of roman there is a fineness which is treacherous he felt that he was entering the water and that he no longer had a pavement under his feet but only mud
it sometimes happens that on certain stores of bretagne of scotland am a neither a traveller or a fisherman while walking at low tide on the beach far from shore suddenly noticed that for several minutes past he has been walking with some difficulty
the beach underfoot is like pitch missiles stick fast to it it is no longer's and it is bird line
the strand is perfectly dry but at every step that he takes as soon as the foot is raised the print is filled with water
the eye however has perceived no change the immense beach is smooth and tranquil all the sand has the same aspect nothing distinguishes the soil that is solid from that which is not solid the joyous little cloud of sand live continues to leap tumultuous it under the feet of the passed by
the man pursues his way he walks on turns towards the land and eq ford to approach the shore
he is not uneasy
uneasy about what
only he is conscious that the heaviness of his feet seems to be increasing at every step that he takes
all at once he sinks in
he sinks in two or three inches
secured ky he is not on the right road us halts to get his bearings
suddenly he glances at his feet his feet have disappeared
the sand has covered them
he draws his feet out of the san she tries to retrace his steps he turns back he sinks in more deeply than before
the sand is up to his ankles he heard himself free from it and flings himself to the left the sand reaches to mix of the flings himself to the right the sand comes up to his knees
then with indescribable terror he recognizes the fact that he is caught in a quicksand and that he had beneath him that frightful medium in which neither man can walk nor fish can swim
he clings away his burden if he have one hell the end himself like a ship in distress it is too late the sand is above his knees
he shouts he waved his hat or his handkerchief the sand continually gains on him of the beach is deserted of the land is too far away if the bank of sand us to kill famed there is no hero in the neighborhood will cover he is condemned to be engulfed
he is condemned to that terrible interment long infallible implacable which it is impossible to either retard or hasten which paste for hours which will not come to an end which seizes you erect free in the flush of health which drags you down by the feet which at every effort that you attempt at every about that you utter draws you a little lower which has the air of punishing you for your resistance by age doubled grasp which forces a man to return slowly to earth while leaving him time to survey the horizon they reds the verdant country the smoke of the villages on the plain the sails of the ships in the sea the birds which fly and sing the sun and the sky
this engulf ment is the sepulchre which assumes a ride and which mounts from the depths of the earth towards a living man
each minute is an inexorable layer out of the dead
the wretched man tries to sit down to lie down to climb every movement that he makes buried him deeper he straightens himself up he sinks he feels that he is being swallowed up he shrieks implored cries to the clouds wrongs his hands grows desperate
behold him in the sand up to his belly the same reaches to his breast he is only a must now
he uplifts his hand sutter's furious groans clenched his nails on the beach tries to cling fast to that ashes supports himself on his elbows in order to raise himself from that sort sheath and sons frantically the sand mounts higher
the sand has reached his shoulders the sand reaches to his throat only his face is visible now
his mouth cried aloud the sand fills it silence
his eyes still gaze for rhymes and closes the knight
then his brow decreases a little hair quivers above the san day and projects pierces the surface of the beach waves and disappears
sinister obliteration of a man
sometimes driver is engulfed with his horse sometimes the carter is swallowed up with his car talk founders in that strand
it is shipwreck elsewhere than in the water
it is the earth drowning a man
the earth permeated with the ocean becomes a pitfall
it presents itself in the guise of a plain and it yawns like a wave
the abyss is subject to the set react eries
this melancholy date always possible on certain sea beaches was also possible thirty years ago in the sewers of paris
before the important works undertaken in the subterranean drain of paris was subject to these sudden slides
the water filtered into certain sub havent strata which were particularly friable the foot day which was of flagstones as in the ancient sewers or of cement in concrete as in the new galleries having no longer an underpinning gave way
a fold in a flooding of this sort means a crack means crumbling
the framework crumbled away for a certain length
this crevice the hiatus of a gulf of more was called a font is in the special tongue
what is a font is
it is the quick sands of the seashore suddenly encountered under the surface of the earth it is the beach of mont saint michel in a sewer
the soaked skills in a state of fusion as it were all its molecules are in suspension in soft medium it is not earth and it is not water
the depth is sometimes very great
nothing can be more formidable than such an encounter
if the water predominates death is prompt the man is swallowed up of earth predominates death is slow
can anyone picture to himself such a death
if being swallowed by the earth is terrible on the seashore what is it in a cesspool
instead of the open air the broad daylight the clear horizon those vast sounds those free clouds whence rains life instead of those barks descried in the distance of that hope under all sorts of forms of probable passersby of succor possible up to the very last moment instead of all this deafness blindness a black vault the inside of a tomb already prepared death in the more beneath a cover
slow suffocation by filth a stone box where asphyxia open site clad in the more and clutches you by the throat fetishes's mingled with the death rattles line instead of the strand sulfur etter hydrogen in place of the hurricane sung in place of the ocean
and most out to gnash one's teeth and to writhe and to struggle and to agonize with that enormous city which knows nothing of it all over one's head
in express ibid is the horror of dying thus
death sometimes redeems his atrocity by a certain terrible dignity
in the funeral pile in shipwreck one can be great in the flames as in the foam a superb attitude is possible one there becomes transfigured as one perishes
but not here
death is filthy
it is humiliating to expire
the supreme floating visions are abject
mud is synonymous with shame
it is petty ugly infamous
to die in a butt of malvo i dislike clarence is permissible in the witch of a scavenger liked's doubles his horrible
to struggle therein is hideous at the same time that one is going through the death agony one is floundering about
there are shadows enough for help and more enough to render it nothing but a slough and the dying man knows not whether he is on the point of becoming a spectre of a frog
everywhere else the sepulchre is sinister herein is deformed
the depth of the font is varied as well as their length and their density according to the more or less bad quality of the subsoil
sometimes a font is was three or four feet deep sometimes eight often sometimes the bottom was unfathomable
here the more was almost solid there almost liquid
in the lumiere font is it would have taken a man a day to disappear while he would have been devoured in five minutes by the philippe aux slough
the more bears up more or less according to its density
a child can escape where a man will perish
the first law of safety is to get rid of every sort of load
every sewer man who felt the ground giving way beneath him began by flinging away his sack of tools or his back basket of his god
the font is were due to different causes the fri ability of the soil some land slip at a depth beyond the reach of man the violent summer rains the incessant flooding of winter long drizzling showers
sometimes the weight of the surrounding houses on a marly or sandy soil forced out the vaults of the subterranean galleries and caused them to bend a side of it chanced that a flooring vault burst and split under this crushing thrust
in this manner the healing up of the parthenon obliterated a century ago a portion of the vaults of saint genevieve hill
when a sewer was broken in under the pressure of the houses the mischief was sometimes be tested in the street above by a sort of space like the teeth of a saw between the paving stones this crevice was developed in an undulating line throughout the entire length of the cracked vault and then the evil being visible the remedy could be promptly applied
it also frequently happened that the interior ravages were not revealed by any external scar and in that case woe to the sewer men
when they entered without precaution into the sewer they were liable to be lost
ancient registers make mention of several scavengers who were buried in font is in this manner
they give many names among others that of the sewer man who was swallowed up in a quagmire under the manhole of the eye care me prenant a certain blaise pourra in this blaise pour rain was the brother of nicholas p. out rain who was the last grave digger of the cemetery called the charm is fees innocents in the epoch when that cemetery expired

chapter vi then on his jean valjean found himself in the presence of a font is
this sort of quagmire was common at that period in the subsoil of the champs elysees difficult to handle in the hydraulic works and a bad preservative of the subterranean constructions on account of its excessive fluidity
this fluidity exceeds even the inconsistency of the sands of the quartier saint georges which could only be conquered by a stone construction on a concrete foundation and the clayey strata infected with gas of the quartier des martyrs which are so liquid that the only way in which a passage was effected under the gallery des martyrs was by means of a cast iron pipe
when in the old stone sewer beneath the faubourg saint honore in which we now see jean valjean was demolished for the purpose of reconstructing of the quicksand which forms the subsoil of the champs elysees as far as the seine presented such an obstacle that the operation lasted nearly six months to the great clamor of the dwellers in the riverside particularly those who had hotels and carriages
the work was more than unhealthy it was dangerous
it is true that they had four months and a half of rain and three floors of the seine
the font is which jean valjean had encountered was caused by the downpour of the preceding day
the pavement badly sustained by the subj scents and had given way and had produced a stoppage of the water
infiltration had taken place a slip had followed
the dislocated bottom had sunk into the poze
to what extent
impossible to say
the obscurity was more dense there than elsewhere
it was a lot of more in a cavern of night
jean valjean felt the pavement vanishing beneath his feet
he entered this slime
there was water on the surfaces like at the bottom
he must pass it
to retrace his steps was impossible
marius was dying and jean valjean exhausted
besides where waste to go
jean valjean advanced
moreover the pit seemed for the first few steps not to be very deep
but in proportion as he advanced his feet plunged deeper
soon he had the slime up to his calves and water above his knees
he walked on raising marius in his arms as far above the water as he could
the more now reached to his knees and the water to his waist
he could no longer retreat
this mud dense enough for one man could not obviously uphold two
marius and jean valjean would have stood a chance of extricating themselves singly
jean valjean continued to advance supporting the dying man who was perhaps a corpse
the water came up to his armpits he felt that he was sinking it was only with difficulty that he could move in the depth of ooze which he had now reached
the density which was his support was also an obstacle
he still held marius on high and with an unheard of expenditure of force he advanced still but he was sinking
he had only his head above the water now and his two arms holding up marius
in the old paintings of the deluge there is another holding her child this
he sank still deeper he turned his face to the dear to escape the water and in order that he might be able to breathe anyone who had seen him in that gloom would have thought that what he beheld was a mask floating on the shadows he caught a faint glimpse above him of the drooping head and livid face of marius he made a desperate effort and launched his foot forward his foot struck something solid a point of support
it was high time
he straightened himself up and rooted himself upon that point of support with a sort of fury
this produced upon him the effect of the first step in a staircase leading back to life
the point of support this encountered in the more at the supreme moments as the beginning of the other watershed of the pavement which has bent but had not given way and which had curved under the water like a plank and in a single piece
well built pavements form a vault and possess this sort of firmness
this fragment of the vaulting partly submerged but solid was a veritable inclined plane and once on this plane he was date
jean valjean mounted this inclined plane and reached the other side of the quagmire
as he emerged from the water he came in contact with a stone and fell upon his knees
he reflected that this was but just and he remained there for some time with his soul absorbed in words addressed to god
he rose to his feet shivering chilled foul smelling tower beneath the dying man whom he was changing after him all dripping with slime and his soul filled with a strange light
chapter vii one sometimes runs aground when one fancied that one is disembarking he set out on his way once more
however although he had not left his life in the font is he seemed to have left his strength behind him there
that supreme effort had exhausted him
his lassitude washoe such that he was obliged to pause for breath every three or four steps and lean against the wall
once he was forced to seat himself on the banquet te in order to alter marius' position and he thought that he should have to remain there
but it his vigor was dead his energy was not
he rose again
he walked on desperately almost fast proceeded this for a hundred paces almost without drawing breath and suddenly came in contact with the wall
he had reached an elbow of the sewer and arriving at the turn with head bent down he had struck the wall
he raised his eyes and at the extremity of the vault far very far away in front of him he perceived a light
this time it was not that terrible light it was good white light
it was daylight
jean valjean saw the outlet
a damned soul who in the midst of the furnace should suddenly perceive the outlet of gehenna would experience what jean valjean felt
it would fly wildly with the stumps of its burned wings towards that radiant portal
jean valjean was no longer conscious of fatigue be no longer felt marius' weight be found his legs once more of steel began rather than walker
as he approached the outlet became more and more distinctly defined
it was a point search lower than the vault which gradually narrowed and narrower than the gallery which closed in as the fault tree lower
the tunnel ended like the interior of a funnel a faulty construction imitated from the wickets of penitentiaries logical in a prison illogical in a sewer and which has since been corrected
jean valjean reached the outlet
there be halted
it certainly was the outlet but he could not get out
the arch was closed by a heavy grating and the grating which to all appearance rarely swing on its rusty hinges was clamped to its stone jamb by a thick lock which red with rust seemed like an enormous brick
the keyhole could be seen and the robust larch deeply sunk in the iron staple
the door was plainly double locked
it was one of those prison locks which old paris was so fond of lavishing
beyond the grating was the open air the river the daylight the whore very narrow but sufficient for escape
the distant quays paris that gulf in which one so easily hides oneself the broad horizon liberty
on the right downstream the bridge of jena was discernible in the left upstream the bridge of the invalides the place would have been a propitious one in which to await the night and to escape
it was one of the most solitary points in paris the shore which faces the grand caillou
flies were entering and emerging through the bars of the grating
it might have been half past eighto'clock in the evening
the day was declining
jean valjean laid marius down along the call on the dry portion of the vaulting then he went to the grating and clenched both fish around the bars the shock which he gave it was frenzied but it did not move
the grating did not stir
jean valjean seized the bars one after the other in the hope that he might be able to tear away the least solid and to make of its lever wherewith to raise the door or to break the lock
not a bar stirred
the teeth of a tiger are not more firmly fixed on their sockets
no lever no prying possible
the obstacle was invincible
there was no means of opening the gate
must be then stop there
what was metodo
what was to become of him
he had not the strength to retrace his steps to recommence the journey which he had already taken
besides how waste to again traverse that quagmire whence he had only extricated himself as by a miracle
and after the quagmire was there not the police patrol which assuredly could not be twice avoided
and then whither waste to go
what direction should be pursue
to follow the incline would not conduct him to his goal
if he were to reach another outlet he would find it obstructed by all i got a grating
every outlet was undoubtedly dlo are in that manner
chance had unsealed the grating through which he had entered but it was evident that all the other sewer mouths were barred
he had only succeeded in escaping into a prison
all was over
everything that jean valjean had done was useless
exhaustion has ended in failure
they were both caught in the immense and gloomy web of death and jean valjean felt the terrible spider running along those black strands and quivering in the shadows
he turned his back to the grating and fell upon the pavement hurled to earth rather than seated close to marius who still made no movement and with his head bent between his knees
this was the last drop of anguish
of what was he thinking during this profound depression
neither of himself nor of markus
he was thinking of cosette
chapter viii the torn coat talk in the midst of this prostration a hand was laid on his shoulder and a low voice said to him half shares
some person in that gloom
nothing so closely resembles a dream as despair
jean valjean thought that he was r. framing
he had heard no footsteps
was it possible
he raised his eyes
a man stood before him
this man was clad in a blouse his feet were bare he held his shoes in his left hand he had evidently removed them in order to reach jean valjean without allowing his steps to be heard
jean valjean did not hesitate for an instant
unexpected as wash his encounter this man was known to him
the man was the barrier
although awakened so to speak with a start jean valjean accustomed to alarms and steeped to unforeseen shocks that must be promptly parties instantly re gained possession of his presence of mind
moreover the situation could not be made worse a certain degree of distress is no longer capable of a crescendo and the barrier himself could add nothing to this blackness of this night
a momentary pause ensued
the barrier raising his right hand to a level with his forehead formed with its share then he brought his eye lashes together by screwing up his eyes a motion which in connection with a slight contraction of the mouth characterizes the sagacious attention of a man who is endeavoring to recognize another man
he did not succeed
jean valjean as we have just stated had his back turned to the light and he was moreover so disfigured so be hired so bleeding that he would have been unrecognizable in full moon day
on the contrary illuminated by the light from the grating a cellar light it is true livid yet precise in its livid ness the bar died as the energetic popular metaphor expresses it immediately leaped into jean valjean's eyes
this inequality of conditions sufficed to assure some advantage to jean valjean in that mysterious duel which was on the point of beginning between the two situations and the two men
the encounter took place between jean valjean veiled and the hardier unmasked
jean valjean immediately perceived that the barrier did not recognize him
they surveyed each other for a moment in that half gloom as though taking each other's measure
the nerdier was the first to break the silence
how are you going to manage to get out
jean valjean made no reply
the hardier continued it's impossible to pick the lock of that gate
but still you must get out of this
that is true said jean valjean
well half shares then
what do you mean by that
you have killed that man that's allright
i have the key
the hard ifd pointer to marius
he went on idon't know you but i want to help you
you must be a friend
jean valjean began to comprehend
the hardier took him for an assassin
the hardy were aimed listen comrade
you didn't kill that man without looking to see what he had in his pockets
give me by half
i'll open the door for you
and half drawing from beneath his tattered blouse a huge key he added to you want to see how a key to liberty is made
look here
jean valjean remained stupid the expression belongs to the elder corneille to such a degree that he doubted whether what he beheld was real
it was providence appearing in horrible guide and his good angel springing from the earth in the form of the barrier
the barrier thrust his fist into a large pocket concealed under his blouse drew out a rope and offered it to jean valjean
hold on said he i'll give you the role to boot
what is the role for
you will need a stone also but you can find one outside
there's a heap of rubbish
what ami to do with a stone
idiot you'll want to sling that stuff into the river you'll need a stone and a rope otherwise it would float on the water
jean valjean took the rope
there is no one who does not occasionally accepting his mechanical way
the barrier snapped his fingers as though an idea had suddenly occurred to hun
ah see here comrade how did you contrive to get out of that slough yonder
i haven't dared to risk myself in it
phew
youdon''t smell good
after a pause he added i'm asking you questions but you're perfectly right not to answer
it's an apprenticeship against that cursed quarter of an hour before the examining magistrate
and then when youdon''t talk at all you run no risk of talking too loud
that's no matter as ican't see your face and as idon't know your name you are wrong in supposing that idon't know who you are and what you want
it wig
you've broken up that gentleman a bit now you want to fuck him away somewhere
the river that great hider of folly is what you want
i'll get you out of your scrape
helping a good fellow in a pinch is what suits me to a hair
while expressing his approval of jean valjean's silence he endeavored to force him to talk
he jostled his shoulder in an attempt to catch a sight of his profile and he exclaimed without however raising his tone apropos of that quagmire you're a hearty animal
why didn't you toss the man in there
jean valjean preserved silence
the barrier resumed pushing the tag which served him as a cravat to the level of his adam's apple a gesture which completes the capable aurora serious man after all you acted wisely
the workmen when they come tomorrow to stop up that hole would certainly have found the stuff abandoned there and it might have been possible thread by thread straw by straw to pick up the scent and reach you
someone has passed through the sewer
who
where did he get out
was be seen to come out
the police are full of cleverness
the sewer is treacherous and tells tales of you
such a fund is a rarity it attracts attention very few people make use of the sewers for their affairs while the river belongs to everybody
the river is the true grave
at the end of a month they bishop your man in the nets at saint cloud
well what does one card for that
it's carrion
who killed that man
paris
and justice makes no inquiries
you have done well
the more loquacious then archer became the more mute was jean valjean
again the barriers took him by the shoulder
now let's settle this business
let's go shares
you have seen my key show me your money
the barrier was haggard fierce suspicious rather menacing yet amicable
there was one singular circumstance the hardier's manners were not simple he had not the air of being wholly at his ease while affecting an air of mystery he spoke low from time to time he laid his finger on his mouth and muttered bush
it was difficult to divine why
there was no one there except themselves
jean valjean thought that other ruffians might possibly be concealed in some nook not very far off and that the barrier did not care to share with them
the barrier resumed let's settle up
how much did the stuff have in his name
jean valjean searched his pockets
it was his habit as the reader will remember to always have some money about him
the mournful life of expedients to which he had been condemned imposed this as a law upon him
on this occasion however he had been caught unprepared
when winning his uniform of a national guardsman on the preceding evening he had forgotten role fully absorbed as he was to take his pocket book
he had only some small change in his fob
he turned out his pocket all soaked with ooze and spread out on the banquet feof the vault one louisd' or two five franc pieces and five or six large sous
the barrier thrust out his lower lip with a significant twist of the neck
you knocked him over cheap said he
he set to feeling the pockets of jean valjean and marius with the greatest familiarity
jean valjean who was chiefly concerned in keeping his back to the light let him have his way
while handling marius' coat the barrier with the skill of a pickpocket and without being noticed by jean valjean tore off a strip which he concealed under his blouse probably thinking that this morsel of stuff might serve later on to identify the assassinated man and the assassin
however he found no more than the thirty france
that's true said he both of you together have no more than that
and forgetting his motto half share she took all
he hesitated a little over the large sous
we get due reflection he took them also muttering nevermind
you cut films' throats too cheap altogether
that do hehe once more drew the big key from under his blouse
now my friend you must leave
it's like the fair here you pay when you go out
you have paid now clear out
and he began to laugh
had me in lending to this stranger the aid of hickey and in making some other man than himself emerge from that portal the pure and disinterested intention of rescuing an assassin
we may be permitted to doubt this
the barrier helped jean valjean to replace marius on his shoulders then he betook himself to the grating on tiptoe and barefooted making jean valjean a sign to follow him looked out laid his finger on his mouth and remained for several seconds as though in suspense his inspection finished he placed the key in the lock
the boot slipped back and the gate swung open
it neither grated not squeaked
it moved very softly
it was obvious that this gate and those hinges carefully oiled were in the habit of opening more frequently than was supposed
this softness was suspicious it hinted at furtive goings and coming's silent entrances and exits of nocturnal men and the wolf like tread on crime
the sewer was evidently an accomplice of some mysterious band
this taciturn grating was a receiver of stolen goods
the barrier opened the gate a little way allowing just sufficient space for jean valjean to pass out closed the heating again gave the mega double turn in the lock and plunged back into the darkness without making any more noise than a breath
he seemed to walk with the velvet laws of a tiger
a moment later that hideous providence had retreated into the invisibility
jean valjean found himself in the open air
chapter ix marius produced on someone who is a judge of the matter the effect of being dead be allowed marius to slide down upon the shore
they were in the open air
the miasma's darkness horror lay behind him
the pure healthful living joyous air that was easy to breathe inundated him
everywhere around him reigned silence but that charming silence when the sun has set in an unclouded azure sky
twilight had descended night was drawing on the great delivered the friend of all those who need a mantle of darkness that they may escape from an anguish
the sky presented itself in all directions like an enormous calm
the river flowed to his feet with the sound of a kiss
the aerial dialogue of the nests bidding each other good night in the elms of the champs elysees was audible
a few stars daintily piercing the pale blue of the zenith and visible for every alone formed imperceptible little splendors amid the intensity
evening was unfolding over the head of jean valjean all the sweetness of the infinite
it was that exquisite and undecided hour which says neither jew nor no
night was already sufficiently advanced to render it possible to lose oneself at a little distance and yet there was sufficient daylight to permit of recognition at close quarters
for several seconds jean valjean was irresistibly overcome by that august and caressing serenity such moments of oblivion do come to msn suffering refrains from harassing the unhappy wretch everything is eclipsed in the thoughts peace broods over the dreamer like night and beneath the twilight which beams and in imitation of the sky which is illuminated the soul becomes studded with stars
jean valjean could not refrain from contemplating that fast clear shadow which rested over him thoughtfully he batted in the sea of ecstasy and prayer in the majestic silence of the eternal heavens
then he bent down swiftly to marius as though the sentiment of duty had returned to him and ripping up water in the hollow of his hand he gently sprinkled a few drops on the latter's face
marius' eyelids did not open but his half open mouth still breathed
jean valjean was on the point of sipping his hand in the river once more when all at once he experienced an indescribable embarrassment such as a person feels when there is someone behind him whom he does not see
we have already alluded to this impression with which everyone is familiar
he turned round
someone was in fact behind him as there had been a short while before
a man of lofty stature enveloped in a long coat with folded arms and bearing in his right vista bludgeon of which the leaden head was visible stood a few paces in the rear of the spot where jean valjean was crouching over marius
with the aid of the darkness it seemed a sort of apparition
an ordinary man would have been alarmed because of the twilight a thoughtful man on account of the bludgeon
jean valjean recognized javert
the reader has divines no doubt that the barrier's pursued was no other than javert
javert after his unlooked for escape from the barricade had be taken himself to the prefecture of police had rendered a verbal as cling to the prefect in person in a brief audience had then immediately gone on duty again which implies the note the reader will recollect which had been captured on his persona certain surveillance of the shore on the right bank of the seine near the champs elysees which had for sometime last aroused the attention of the police
there he had caught sight of the barrier and had followed him
the reader knows the best
thus it will be easily understood that that grating so obligingly opened to jean valjean was a bit of cleverness on the nqt died's part
the hardier intuitively felt that is very was still there the man spied upon has ascent which never deceived him it was necessary to fling a bone to that sleuth hound
an assassin what a godsend
such an opportunity must never be allowed to slip
the barrier by putting jean valjean outside in his stead provided a prey for the police forces them to relinquish his scent made them forget him in a bigger adventure repair javert for his waiting which always flatters as it warned thirty france and counted with certainty so far as he himself was concerned on escaping with the aid of this diversion
jean valjean had fallen from one danger upon another
these two encounters this falling one after the other from the barrier upon javert was a rude shock
javert did not recognize jean valjean who as we have stated no longer looked like himself
he did not unfold his arms he made sure of his bludgeon in his fist by an imperceptible movement and said in a cure calm voice who are you
i
who is' i'
jean valjean
javert thrust his bludgeon between his teeth bent his knees inclined his body laid his two powerful hands on the shoulders of jean valjean which were clamped within them as in a couple offices scrutinized him and recognized him
their faces almost touched
javert's look was terrible
jean valjean remained inert beneath javert's grasp like a lion submitting to the class of a lynx
inspector javert said he you have me in your power
moreover i have regarded myself as your prisoner ever since this morning
i did not give you my address with any intention of escaping from you
take me
only grant me one favor
javert did not appear to hear him
he kept his eyes riveted on jean valjean
his chin being contracted thrust his lips upwards towards his nose a sign of savage're very
at length be released jean valjean straightened himself stiffly up without bending grasped his bludgeon again firmly and as though in a dream he murmured rather than uttered this question what are you doing here
and who is this man
he still abstained from addressing jean valjean as thou
jean valjean replied and the sound of his voice appeared to rouse is very it is with regard to him that i desire to speak to you
dispose of me as you see fit but first help me to carry him home
that is all that i ask if you
javert's face contracted as was always the case when anyone seemed to think him capable of making a concession
nevertheless he did not say no
again he bent over drew from his pocket a handkerchief which he moistened in the water and with which he then wiped marius' blood stained brow
this man was at the barricade said he in a low voice and as though speaking to himself
he is the one they called marius
a spy of the first quality who had on served everything listened to everything and taken in everything even when he thought that he was to die who had played the spy even in his agony and who with his elbows leaning on the first step of the sepulchre had taken notes
he seized marius' hand and felt his pulse
he is wounded said jean valjean
he is a dead man said javert
jean valjean replied no
not yet
so you have brought him thither from the barricade
remarked javert
his preoccupation must indeed have been very profound for him not to insist on this alarming rescue through the sewer and for him not go even notice jean valjean's silence after his question
jean valjean on his side seemed to have but one thought
he resumed he lives in the marais rue des filles ducal valve with his grandfather
i do not recollect his name
jean valjean fumbled in marius' coat pulled out his pocket book opened it at the page which marius had pencilled and he is it out to javert
there was still sufficient light to admit of reading
besides this is very possessed in his eye there line phosphorescence of night birds
be deciphered the few lines written by marius and muttered ville normand rue des filles du val val reno
then he exclaimed coachman
the reader will remember that the hackney coach was waiting in case of need
is very kept marius' pocketbook
a moment later the carriage which had descended by the inclined plane of the watering place was on the shore
marius was laid upon the backseat and javert seated himself on the front seat beside jean valjean
the door slammed and the carriage drove rapidly away ascending the quays in the direction of the bastille
they quitted the quays and entered the streets
the coachman a black form on his bid whipped up his thin horses
a glacial silence reigned in the carriage
markus motionless with his body resting in the corner and his head dropping on his breast his arms hanging his legs stuff seemed to be awaiting only a coffin jean valjean seemed made of shadow and javert of stone and in that vehicle full of night whose interior every time that it passed in front of a street lantern appeared to be turned lucidly san as by an intermittent flash of lightning change had united and seemed to be bringing face to face the three forms of tragic immobility the corpse the spectre and the statue
chapters return of the son who was prodigal of his life at every jolt over the pavement a drop of blood trickled from marius' hair
night had fully closed in when the carriage arrived at no
rue des filles ducal faire
javert was the first to a light he made sure with one glance of the number on the carriage gate and raising the heavy knocked off water iron embellished in the old style with a male goat and a satyr confronting each other he gave a violent peak
they are opened a little way and javert gave it a push
the porter half made his appearance yawning vaguely awake and with a candle in his hand
everyone in the house was asleep
people go to badge times in the marais especially on days when there is a revolt
this good old quarter terrified at the revolution takes refuge in slumber as children when they hear the bugaboo coming hide their heads hastily under their coverlet
in the meantime jean valjean and the coachman had taken marius out of the carriage jean valjean supporting him under the armpits and the coachman under the knees
as they thus bore marius jean valjean slipped his hand under the latter's clothes which were broadly rent felt his breast and assured himself that his heart was still beating
it was even beating a little less feebly as though the movement of the carriage had brought about a certain fresh access of life
javert addressed the port erin at one befitting the government and the presence of the porter of a factious person
's one person whose name is to lie normand
here
what do you want with him
his son is brought back
his son
said the ported stupidly
he is dead
jean valjean who soiled and tattered stood behind have grand whom the porter was surveying with some horror made a sign to him with his head that this was not so
the porter did not appear to understand either have rt's words or jean valjean's sign
javert continued he went to the barricade and here he is
to the barricade
ejaculated the porter
he has got himself killed
to waken his father
the porter did not shir
go along with you
repeated javert
and he added there will be a funeral here tomorrow
for i avert the usual incidents of the public highway were categorically classes which is the beginning of foresight and surveillance and each contingency had its own compartment all possible facts were arranged in drawers as it were whence they emerged on occasion in variable quantities in the street uproar revolt carnival and funeral
the porter contented himself with waking basque
basque woke nicolette nicolette roused great aunt ville normand
as for the grandfather they let him sleep on thinking that he would hear about the matter early enough on any case
marius was carried up to the first floor without anyone in the other parts of the house being aware of the fact and deposited on an old sofa in m
ville norm and's antechamber and while basque went in search of a physician and while nicolette opened the linen presses jean valjean felt javert touch him on the shoulder
he understood and descended the stairs having behind him the step of javert who was following him
the porter watched them take their departure as he had watched their arrival in terrified somnolence
they entered the carriage once more and the coachman mounted his box
inspector javert said jean grant me yet another favor
what is it
demanded is very roughly
let me go home for one instant
then you shall do whatever you like with me
have rt remained silent for a few moments with his chin drawn back into the collar of his great coat then he lowered the glass and front driver said he rue del' homme arms no
chapter xi concussion in the absolute they did not open their lips again during the whole space of their ride
what did jean valjean want
to finish what he had begun to warn cosette to tell her where marius was to give her possibly some other useful information to take if he could certain final measures
sc for himself so far as he was personally concerned all was over he had been seized by kavery and had not resisted any other man than himself in like situation would perhaps have had some vague thoughts connected with the rope which the barrier had given him and of the bars of the first cell that he should enter but let us impress it upon the reader after the bishop there had existed in jean valjean a profound hesitation in the presence of any violence even when directed against himself
suicide that mysterious act of violence against the unknown which may contain in a measure these sgh of the soul was impossible to jean valjean
at the entrance to the rue del' homme at me the carriage halted the way being too narrow to admit of the entrance of vehicles
javert and jean valjean a lighted
the coachman humbly represented to monsieurl' inspecteur that the utrecht velvet of his carriage was all spotted with the blood of the assassinated man and with more from the assassin
that is the way he understood it
he added that an indemnity was due him
at the same time drawing his certificate book from his pocket he begged the inspector to have the goodness to write him a bit of an attestation
javert thrust aside the book which the coachman held out to him and said how much do you want including your time of waiting and the drive
it comes to seven hours and a quarter replied the man and my velvet was perfectly new
eighty france mr
inspector
javert drew four napoleon's from his pocket and dismissed the carriage
jean valjean fancied that it was javert's intention to conduct him on foot to the post or the blanc's mantra us or to the post of the archives both of which are close at hand
they entered the street
it was deserted as usual
javert followed jean valjean
they reached no.
jean valjean knocked
the door opened
it is well said javert
go upstairs
he added with a strange expression and as though he were exerting an effort in speaking in this manner i will wait for you here
jean valjean looked at javert
this mode of procedure was but little in accord with javert's habits
however he could not be greatly surprised that is very should now have a sort of naughty confidence in him the confidence of the cat which grants the mouse liberty to the length of its claws seeing that jean valjean had made up his mind to surrender himself and to make an end of it
he pushed open the door entered the house called to the poster who was in bed and who had pulled the cord from his couch it is i
and ascended the stairs
on arriving at the first floor he paused
all sorrowful glass have their stations
the window on the landing place which was a sash window was open
as in many ancient houses the staircase got it's light from without an vhs davies on the street
the street lantern situated directly opposite cast some light on the stairs and thus effected some economy in illumination
jean valjean either for the sake of getting the air or mechanical my thrust his head out of this window
he leaned out over the street
it is short and the lantern lighted it from end to end
jean valjean was overwhelmed with amazement there was no longer anyone there
javert had taken his departure
chapter xii the grandfather basque and the porter has carried marius into the drawing room as he still lay stretched out motionless on the sofa upon which he had been placed on his arrival
the doctor who had been sent for bad hastened thither
aug triple norm and had risen
aunt ville norm and went and came in affright wringing her hands and incapable of doing anything but saying heavens
is it possible
at times she added everything will be covered with blood
when her first horror had passed off a certain philosophy of the situation penetrated her mind and took form in the exclamation it was bound to end in this way
she did not go so far as i told you so
which is customary on this sort of occasion
at the physician's orders a camp bed has been prepared beside the sofa
the doctor examined marius and after having found that his pulse was still beating that the wounded man had no very deep wound on his breast and that the books on the corners of his lips proceeded from his nostrils he had him placed flat on the bed without a pillow with his head on the same level as his body and even a trifle power and with his busen are in order to facilitate respiration
mademoiselle tille normandin perceiving that they were undressing marius withdrew
she set herself to telling her beads in her own chamber
the trunk had not suffered any internal injury a bullet deadened by the pocketbook had turned aside and made the tour of his ribs with a hideous laceration which was of no great depth and com sequently not dangerous
the long underground journey had completed the dislocation of the broken collarbone and the disorder there was serious
the arms had been slashed with sabre cuts
not a single scar disfigured his face but his head was fairly covered with cuts what would be the result of these wounds on the head
would they stop short at the hairy cuticle or would they attack the brain
as yet this could not be decided
a grave symptom was that they had caused as soon and that people do not always recover from such swoons
moreover the wounded man had been exhausted by hemorrhage
from the waist down the barricade had protested the lower part of the body from injury
vasque and nicolette tore up linen and prepared bandages nicolette sewer them basque rolled them
asking was lacking the doctor for the time being arrested the bleeding with layers of wadding
beside the bed three candles burned on a table where the case of surgical instruments lay spread out
the doctor bathed marius' face and hair with cold water
a full paul was redeemed in an instant
the porter candle in hand lighted them
the doctor seemed to be pondering sadly
from time to time he made a negative sign with his head as though replying to some question which he had inwardly addressed to himself
a bad sign for the sick man are these mysterious dialogues of the doctor with himself
at the moment when the doctor was wiping marius' face and lightly touching his still closed eyes with his fingers door opened at the end of the drawing room and along pallid figure made its appearance
this was the grandfather
the revolt had for the past two days deeply agitated enraged and engrossed the kind of m
ville normand
he had not been able to sleep on the previous night and he had been in a fever all day long
in the evening he had gone to bed very early recommending that everything in the house should be well barred and he had fallen into a dose through sheer fatigue
old men sleep lightly m
ville norman c.'s chamber adjoined the drawing room and in spite of all the precautions that had been taken the noise had awakened him
surprised at the gift of light which he saw under his door he had risen from his bed and had groped his way thither
he stood astonished on the threshold one hand on the handle of the half open door with his head bent a little forward and quivering his body wrapped in a white dressing gown which was straight and as destitute of foods as a winding sheet and he had the air of a phantom who is gazing into atom n
he saw the bed and on the mattress that young man bleeding white with a waxen whiteness with closed eyes and gaping mouth and pallid lips stripped to the waist slashed all over with crimson wounds motionless and brilliantly lighted up
the grandfather trembled from head to foot as powerfully as ossified limbs can tremble his eyes whose corneas were yellow on account of his great age were veiled in a sort of vitreous glitter his whole face assumed in an instant the earth tangles of a skull his arms fell pendent as though a spring had broken and his amazement was betrayed by the out spreading of the fingers of his two aged bands which quivered all over his knees formed an angle in front allowing through the opening in his dressing gowns view of his poor bare legs all bristling with white hairs and he murmured marius
corsair basque monsieur has just been brought back
he went to the barricade and
he is dead
cried the old man in a terrible voice
ah
the rascal
then a sort of sepulchral transformation straightened up this centenarians detect as a young man
sir said he you are the doctor
begin by telling me one thing
he is dead is he not
the doctor who was at the highest pitch of anxiety remained silent
m
ville norm and wrung his hands with an outburst of terrible laughter
he is dead
he is dead
he is dead
he has got himself killed on the barricades
out of hatred home
he did that to spine me
ah
you blood drinker
this is the way he returns home
misery of my life he is dead
he went to the window threw it wide open as though he were stifling and erect before the darkness he began to talk into the street to the night pierced sabres exterminated slashed marked in pieces
just look at that the villain
he knew well that i was waiting for him and that i had had his room arranged and that i had placed at the head of my bed his portrait taken when he was a little child
he knew well that he had only to come back and that i had been're calling him for years and that i remained by my fireside with my hands on my knees not knowing what to do and that i was mad over it
you knew well that you had but to return and to say' it isl' and you would have been the master of the house and that i should have obeyed you and that you could have done whatever you pleased with your old num skull of a grandfather
you knew that we'll and you said note is a royalist i will not go
and you went to the barricades and you got yourself killed out of malice
to revenge yourself for what i said to you about monsieur le duc de berry
it is infamous
go to nzd then and sleep tranquilly
he is dead and this is my awakening
the doctor who was beginning to be uneasy in both quartet squirted marius for a moment went to m
ville normand and took his arm
there and father turned round gazed at him with eyes which seemed exaggerated in size and bloodshot and said to him calmly i thank you sit
i am composed i am a man i witnessed the death of louis xvi
i know how to bear events
one thing is terrible and that is to think that it is your newspapers which do all the mischief
you will have scribbler's charterers lawyers orators tribune's discussions progress enlighten me by the rights of man the liberty of the press and this is the day that your children will be brought home to you
ah
marius
it is abominable
killed
read before me
a barricade
at the scam o
doctor you live in this quarter i believe
ph
i know you well
i see your cabriolet pass my window
i am going to tell you
you are wrong to think that i am angry
one does not fly into a rage against a deadman
that would be stupid
this is a child whom i have reared
i was already old while he was very young
he played in the tuileries garden with his little shovel and his little chair and in order that the inspectors might not grumble is topped up the holes that he made in the earth with his shovel with my cane
one day he exclaimed down with louis xviii
and off he went
it was no fault of mine
he was all rosy and blind
his mother is dead
have you ever noticed that all little children are blind
why is it so
he is the son of one of those brigands of the loire but children are innocent of their fathers' crimes
i remember when he was no higher than that
he could not manage to pronounce his ds
he had a way of talking that was so sweet and indistinct that you would have thought it was a bird chirping
i remember that once in front of the hercules farnese people formed a circle to admire him and marvel at him he was so handsome was that child
he had ahead such as you see in pictures
i talked in a deep voice and i frightened him with my cane but he knew very well that it was only to make him laugh
in the morning when he entered my room i grumbled but he was loud the sunlight to me all the same
one can not defend oneself against those brats
they take hold of you they hold you fact they never let you go again
the truth is that there never was a cupid like that child
now what can you say for your lafayette's your benjamin constants and your tire cuir decor celles who have killed him
this can not be allowed to pass in this fashion
he approached marius who still lat livid and motionless and to whom the physician had returned and began once more to wring his hands
the old man's pallid lips moved as though mechanically and permitted the passage of words that were barely audible like breathe in the death agony am
heartless law
ay
club bist
ah
wretch
ah
septem brief
reproaches in the low voice of an agonizing man addressed to a corpse
little by little as it is always indispensable that internal eruptions should come to the light the sequence of words returned but the grandfather appeared no longer to have the strength to utter them his voice was so weak and extinct that it seemed to come from the other side of an abyss it is all the same time i am going to die too that i am
and to think that there is not a hissy in paris who would not have been delighted to make this wretch happy
as camp who instead of amusing himself and enjoying life went off to fight and get himself shot down like a brute
and for whom
any
for the republic
instead of going to dance at the chain or read it is the duty of young folks to do
what's the use of being twenty years old
the republic a cursed pretty folly
poor mother's beget fine boys do
come he is dead
that will make two funerals under the same carriage gate
so you have got yourself arranged like this for the sake of general la marque's handsome eyes
what had that general la marque done to you
a slasher
a chatterbox
to get oneself killed for a deadman
if thatisn't enough to drive anyone had
just think of it
at twenty
and without so much as turning his head to see whether he was not leaving something behind him
that's the way poor good old fellows are forced to die alone nowadays
perish in your former owl
well after all so much the better that is what i was hoping for this will kill me on the slot
i am too old i am a hundred years old i am a hundred thousand years old i ought by rights to have been dead long ago
this blowouts agency out
so all is over what happiness
what is the good of making him in half ammonia and all that parcel of drugs
you are wasting your trouble you fool of a doctor
come he's dead completely dead
i know all about it i am dead myself too
he hasn't done things by half
yes this age is infamous infamous and that's what i think of you of your ideas of your systems of your masters of your oracles of your doctor's of your scale graces of writers of your rascally philosophers and of all the revolutions which for the last sixty years have been frightening the flocks of crows in the tuileries
but you were pitiless in getting yourself killed like this i shall not even grieve over your death do you understand you assassin
at that moment marius slowly opened his eyes and his glance still dimmed by lethargic wonder rested on m
ville normand
marius
cried the old man
marius
my little marius
my child
my well beloved son
you open your eyes you gaze upon me you are alive thanks
and he fell fainting
book fourth
javert detailed chapter imager to avert passed slowly down the rue del' homme arms
he walked with dropping head for the first time in his life and likewise for the first time in his life with his hands behind his back
up to that day javert had borrowed from napoleon's attitudes only that which is expressive of resolution with arms folded across the chest that which is expressive of uncertainty with the hands behind the back had been unknown to him
now a change had taken place his whole person slow and sombre was stamped with anxiety
he plunged into the silent streets
nevertheless he followed one given direction
he took the shortest cut to the seine reached the quai des ormes skirted the quay passed the greve and halted at some distance from the post of the place du chatelet at the angle of the long notre dame
there between the notre dame and the long au change on the one hand and the quai de la nevis serie and the quai aux fleurs on the other these its forms a sort of square lake traversed by a rapid
this point of the seine is dreaded by mariners
nothing is more dangerous than this rapid hemmed in at that epoch and irritated by the piles of the mill on the bridge now demolished
the two bridges situated this close together augment the peril the water hurries in formidable wise through the arches
it rolls in vast and terrible waves it accumulates and piles up there the flood attacks the piles of the bridges as though in an effort to pluck them up with great liquid ropes
men who fall in there never reappear the best of swimmers are drowned there
javert leaned both elbows on the parapet his chin resting in both hands and while his nails were mechanically tained in the abundance of his whiskers me meditated
a novelty a revolution a catastrophe had just taken place in the depths of his being and he had something upon which to examine himself
javert was undergoing horrible suffering
for several hours javert had ceased to be simple
he was troubled that brains olimpic in its blindness had lost its transparency that crystal was clouded
javert felt duty divided within his conscience and he could not conceal the fact from himself
when he had so unexpectedly encountered jean valjean on the banks of the seine there had been in him something of the wolf which retains his grip on his prey and of the dog who finds his master again
he be held before him two paths both equally straight but he beheld two and that terrified him him who had never in all his life known more than one straight line
and the poignant an tukwila y in this that the two paths were contrary to each other
one of these straight lines excluded the other
which of the two was the true one
his situation was indescribable
too we his life to a male factor to accept that debt and to repay it to be in spite of himself one level with a fugitive from justice and to repay his serv ice with another service to allow it to be said to him go and to say to the latter in his turn be free to sacrifice to personal motives duty that general obliga tion and to be conscious in those personal motives of something that was also general and perchance superior to betray society in order to remain true to his conscience that all these absurdities should be realized and should accumulate upon him this was what overwhelmed him
one thing had amazed him this was that jean valjean should have done him a favor and one thing petrified him that he is very should have done jean valjean a favor
where do and stand
he sought to comprehend his position and could no longer find his bearings
what was be to do now
to deliver up jean valjean was bad to leave jean valjean at liberty was bad
in the first case the man of authority fell lower than the major they alleys in the second a convict rose above the law and set his foot upon it
in both cases dishonor for him javert
there was disgrace in any resolution at which he might arrive
destiny has some extremities which rise perpendicularly from the impossible and beyond which life is no longer anything but a precipice
javert had reached one of those extremities
one of his anxieties consisted in being constrained to think
the very violence of all these conflicting emotions forced him to it
thought was something to which he was unused and which was peculiarly painful
in thought there always exists a certain amount of internal rebellion and it irritated him to have that within him
thought on any subject whatever outside of the restricted circle of his functions would have been for him in any case useless and a fatigue thought on the day which had just passed was a torture
nevertheless it was indispensable that he should take a look into his conscience after such shocks and render to himself an account of himself
what he had just done made him shudder
he is very had seen fit to decide contrary to all the regulations of the police contrary to the whole social and judicial organization contrary to the entire code upon a release this had suited him he had substituted his own affairs for the affairs of the public was not this unjustifiable
every time that he brought himself face to face with this deed without a name which he had committed he trembled from head to bolt
upon what should be decide
one sole resource remained to him to return in all haste to the rue del' homme arms and commit jean valjean to prison
it was clear that that was what he ought to do
he could not
something hatred his way in that direction
something
what
is there in the world anything outside of the tribunal's executory sentences the police and the authorities
javert was overwhelmed
a galley slaves acres
a convict who could not be touched by the law
and that the deed of javert
was it not a fearful thing that javert and jean valjean the man made to proceed with vigor the man made to submit that these two men who were both the things of the law should have come to such a pass that both of them had set themselves above the law
what then
suchen or motifs were to happen and no one was to be punished
jean valjean stronger than the whole social order was to remain at liberty and he is very was to go on eating the government's bread
his're very gradually became terrible
he might athwart this rs very have also reproached himself on the subject of that insurgent who had been taken to the rue des filles ducal faire but he never even thought of that
the lesser fault was lost in the greater
besides that insurgent was obviously a dead man and legally death puts an end to pursuit
jean valjean was the load which weighed up on his spirit
jean valjean disconcerted him
all the axioms which had served him as points of support all his lifelong has crumbled away in the presence of this man
jean valjean's generosity towards him is very crushed him
other facts which he now recalled and which he had formerly treated as lies and folly now recurred to him as realities
m
madeleine reappeared behind jean valjean and the two figures were superposed on such fashion that they now formed but one which was venerable
javert felt that something terrible was penetrating his soul admiration for a convict
respect for a galley space is that a possible thing
he shuddered at it yet could not escape from it
in vain did he struggle he was reduced to confessing is in most heart the sublimity of that wretch
this was odious
a benevolent malefactor merciful gentle helpful clement a convict returning good for evil giving back pardon for hatred preferring pity to vengeance preferring to ruin himself rather than to ruin his enemy saving time house smitten him kneeling on the heights of virtue more nearly akin to an angel than to a man
javert was constrained to admit to himself that this monster existed
things could not go on in this manner
certainly and we insist upon this point he had not yielded without resistance to that monster to that infamous angel to that hideous hero who engaged almost as much as he amazed him
twenty times as he sat in that carriage face to face with jean valjean the legal tiger had roared within him
a score of time she had been tempted to flung himself upon jean valjean to seize him and devour him that is to say to arrest him
what more simple in fact
to cry out at the first post that they passed here is a fugitive from justice who has broken his bag
to summon the gendarmes and say to them this man is yours
then to go off leaving that condemned man there to ignore the rest and not to meddle further in the matter
this man is forever a prisoner of the law the law may do with him what it will
what could be more just
javert had said all this to himself he had wished to pass beyond to act to apprehend the man and then as at present he had not been able to do it and every time that his arm has been raised convulsively towards jean valjean's collar his hand had fallen back again as beneath an enormous weight and in the depths of his thought he had heard a voice a strange voice crying to him it is well
deliver up your savior
then have the basin of pontius pilate brought and wash your class
then his reflections reverted to himself and beside jean valjean glorified he be held himself javert degraded
a convict was his benefactor
but then why has he permitted that man to leave him alive
he had the right to be killed in that barricade
he should have asserted that right
it would have been better to summon the other insurgents to his succor against jean valjean to get himself shot by force
his supreme anguish was the loss of certainty
he felt that he had been uprooted
the code was no longer anything more than a stump in his hand
he had to deal with scruples of an unknown species
there had taken place within him a sentimental revelation entirely distinct from legal affirmation his only standard of measurement hitherto
to remain in his former uprightness did not suffice
a whole order of unexpected facts has cropped up and subjugated him
a whole new world was dawning on his soul kindness accepted and repair devotion mercy indulgence violence's committed by pity on austerity respect for persons no more definitive condemnation no more conviction the possibility of a year in the eye of the law no one knows what justice according to god running in inverse sense to justice according to men
he perceived amid the shadows the terrible rising of an unknown morals unit horrified and dazzled him
an owl forced to the gaze of an eagle
he said to himself that it was true that there were exceptional cases that authority might be put out of countenance that the rule might be inadequate in the presence of a fact that everything could not be framed within the text of the code that the unforeseen compelled obedience that the virtue of a convict might set a share for the virtue of the functionary that destiny did indulge in such ambushes and he reflected with despair that he himself had not even been fortified against a surprise
he was forced to acknowledge that goodness did exist
this convict has been good
and he himself unprecedented circumstance had just been good also
so he was becoming depraved
he found that he was a coward
he conceived a horror of himself
have rt's ideal was not to be human to be grand to be sublime it was to be irreproachable
now he had just failed in this
how has become to such a pass
how has all this happened
he could not have told himself
he clasped his head in both hands but in spite of all that he could done could not contrive to explain it to himself
he had certainly always entertained the intention of restoring jean valjean to the law of which jean valjean was the captive and of which hey a very was the slave
not for a single instant while he held him in his grasp had he confessed to himself that is entertained the idea of releasing him
it was in some sort without his consciousness that his hand had relaxed and had let him to free
all sorts of interrogation points flashed before his eyes
he put questions to himself and made replies to himself and his replies frightened him
he asked himself what has that convict done that desperate fellow whom i have pursued even to persecution and who has had me under his foot and who could have avenged himself and who owed it both to his rancor and to his safety in leaving me my life in showing mercy upon me
his duty
no
something more
and i in showing mercy upon him in my turn what have is one
my duty
no
something more
so there is something beyond duty
here he top of right his balance became disjointed one of the scales fell into the abyss the other rose heavenward and javert was no less terrified by the one which was on high than by the one which was below
without being in the least in the world what is called volta it is not a philosopher or incredulous being on the contrary respectful by instinct towards the established church he knew it only as an august fragment of the social whole order was his dogma and sufficed for him ever since he had attained to man's estate and the rank of a functionary he had centred nearly all his religion in the police
being and here we employ words without the least irony and in their most serious acceptation being as we have said as puss other men are priests
he had a superior m
bosquet up to that day he had never dreamed of that other superior god
this new chief god he became unexpectedly conscious of and he felt embarrassed by him
this unforeseen presence threw him off his bearings he did not know what to do with this superior he who was not ignorant of the fact that the subordinate is bound always t know that he must not disobey not find fault not discuss and that in the presence of a superior who amazed him too greatly the interior has no other resource than that of handing in his resignation
but how waste to set about jan find in his resignation to god
however things might stand and it was to this point that he reverted constantly one fact dominated everything else for him and that was that he had just committed a terrible infraction of the law
he had just shut his eyes on an escaped convict who had broken his bag
he had just set a galley slaves t large
he had just robbed the laws of a man who belonged to them
that was what he had done
me no longer understood himself
the very reasons for his action escaped him only their vertigo was left with him
up to that moment he had lived with that blind faith which gloomy probity engenders
this faith had quitted him this probity had deserted him
all that he had believed in melted away
truths which he did not wish to recognize were besieging him inexorably
henceforth he must be a different man
he was suffering from the strange pains of a conscience abruptly operated on for the cataract
he saw that which it was repugnant to him to behold
he felt himself emptied useless put out of joint with his past life turned out dissolved
authority was dead within him
he had no longer any reason for existing
a terrible situation
to be touched
to be granite and to doubt
to be the statue of chastisement cast in one piece in the mould of the law and suddenly to become aware of the fact that one cherishes beneath one's breast of bronze something absurd and disobedient which almost resembles a heart
to come to the pass of returning good for good although one has said to oneself up to that day that that good is evil
to be the watchdog and to lick the intruder's hand
to be ice and melt
to be the pincers and to turn into a hand
to suddenly feel one's fingers opening
to relax one's grip what a terrible thing
the man projectile no longer acquainted with his route and retreating
to be obliged to confess this to oneself infallibility is not infallible there may exist error in the dogma all has not been said when a code speaks society is not perfect authority is complicated with vacillation a crack is possible in the immutable judges are but men the law may err tribunals may make a mistake
to behold a rift in the immense blue page of the firmament
that which was passing ink a very was the campo us of a rectilinear conscience the derailment of a soul the crushing of a probity which had been irresistibly launched in a straight line and was breaking against god
it certainly was singular that the stoker of order that the engineer of authority mounted on the blind iron horse with its rigid road could be unseated by a flash of light
that the uk movable the direct the correct the geometric so the passive the perfect could bend
that there should exist for the locomotive a road to damascus
god always within man and refractory be the true conscience to the false a prohibition to the spark to die out an order to the day to remember the sun an injunction to the soul to recognize the veritable absolute when confronted with the fictitious absolute human igg which can not be list the human heart indestructible that splendid phenomenon the finest perhaps of all our interior marvels did javert understand this
did javert penetrate it
did javert account for it to himself
evidently he did not
but beneath the pressure of that incontestable in comprehen sibility he felt his brain bursting
he was less the man transfigured than the victim of this prodigy
in all this he perceived only the tremendous difficulty of existence
it seemed to him that henceforth his respiration was repressed forever
he was not accustomed to having something unknown hanging over his head
up to this point everything above him had been to his gaze merely a smooth limpid and simple surface there was nothing in comprehensible nothing obscure nothing that was not defined regularly disposed linked precise circumscribed exact limited closed fully provided for authority was a plane surface there was not all init no dizziness in its presence
javert had never be held the unknown except from below
the irregular the unforeseen the disordered opening of chaos the possible slip over a precipice this was the work of the lower regions of rebels of the wicked of wretches
now is very threw himself back and he was suddenly terrified by this unprecedented apparition a rule on high
what
one was dismantled from top to bottom
one was disconcerted absolutely
in what could one trust
that which had been agreed upon was giving way
what
the defect in society's armor could be discovered by a magnanimous wretch
what
an honest we editor of the law could suddenly find himself caught between two crimes the crime of allowing a man to escape and the crime of arresting him
everything was not settled in the orders given by the state to the functionary
there might be blind alleys in duty
what all this was real
was it true that an ex ruffian weighed down with convictions could rise erect and end by being in the right
was this credible
we're there cases in which the law should retire before transfigured crime and stammer its excuses
yes that was the state of the case
and javert saw it
and javert had touched it
and not only could be not deny it but he had taken part in it
these were realities
it was abominable that actual facts could reach such deformity
if facts did their duty they would confine themselves to being proofs of the law facts it is god who sends them
was anarchy then on the point of how descending from on high
this and in the exaggeration of anguish and the optical illusion of consternation all that might have corrected and restrained this impression was effaced and society and the human race and the universe were henceforth summed up in his eyes in one simple and terrible feature thus the penal laws the thing judged the force due to legislation the decrees of the sovereign court's the magistracy the government prevention repression official cruelty wisdom legal infallibility the principle of authority all the dogmas on which rest political and civil security sovereignty justice public truth all this was rubbish a whale less mass chaos he himself javert the spy of order in corrupt ibility in the service of the police the bulldog providence of society vanquished and hurled to earth and erect at the summit of all that ruins man with a green cap on his head and shall round his brow this was the astounding confusion to which he had come this was the fearful vision which he bore within his soul
was this to be endured
no
a violent state if ever such existed
there were only two ways of escaping from it
one was to go resolutely to jean valjean and restore to his cell the convict from the galleys
the other
javert quitted the parapet and with head erect this time betook himself with a firm tread towards the station house indicated by a lantern at one of the corners of the place du chatelet
on arriving there he saw through the windows sergeant of police and he entered
policemen recognize each other by the very way in which they open the door of a station house
javert mentioned his name showed his card to the sergeant and seated himself at the table of the post on which a candle was burning
on a table lay a pen a leaden ink stand and paper provided in the event of possible reports and the orders of the night patrol c
this table still completed by its straw seated chair is an institution it exists in all police stations it is invariably ornamented with a boxwood saucer filled with sawdust and a water box of cardboard filled with red waders and it forms the lowest stage of official style
it is there that the literature of the state has its beginning
javert took a pen and a sheet of paper and began to write
this is what he wrote a few observations for the roof of the red rice
in the first place i beg monsieur le prefer to cast his eyes on this
secondly prisoners on arriving after examination take off their shoes and stand barefoot in the flagstones while they are being searched
many of them cough on their return to prison
this entails hospital expenses
thirdly the mode of keeping track of a man with relays of police agents from distance to distance is good but on important occasions it is requisite that at least two agents should never lose sight of each other so that in case one agent should for any cause grow weak in his service the other may supervise him and take his place
fourthly it is inexplicable why the special regulation of the prison of the madeline the winter dicts the prisoner from having a chair even by paying for it
fifthly in the madeline eyes there are only two bars to the canteen so that the canteen woman can touch the prisoners with her hand
sixthly the prisoner's called barker's who summon the other prisoners to the parlor force the prisoner to pay them two sous to call his name distinctly
this is a theft
seventh it for a broken thread geneous are withheld in the weaving shop this is an abuse of the contractor since the cloth is none the worse for it
eight uly it is annoying for visitors to la force to be obliged to traverse the boys' court in order to reach the parlor of sainte mariel' egyptienne
monthly it is a fact that any day gendarmes can be overheard relating in the courtyard of the prefecture the interrogations out by the magistrates to prisoners
for a gendarme who should be sworn to secrecy to repeat what he has heard in the examination room is a grave disorder
tenth lynne
henry is an honest woman her canteen is very neat but it is bad to have a woman keep the wicket to the mouse trap of the secret cells
this is unworthy of the concierge rid of a great civilization
javert wrote these lines on his calmest and most correct ch orography not knitting a single comma and making the paper screech under his pen
below the last line he signed javert inspector of the st class
the post of the place du chat soft
ninety about oneo'clock in the morning
javert dried the fresh ink in the paper folded it like a letter sealed it wrote on the backbone for the administration left it on the table and quitted the post
the glazed and tested doorbell go behind him
again be traversed the place du chatelet diagonally regained the quay and returned with automatic precision to the very point which he had abandoned a quarter of an hour previously leaned on his elbows and found himself again in the same attitude on the same paving stone of the parapet
he did not appear to have stirred
the darkness was complete
it was the sepulchral moment which follows mid not it
a ceiling of clouds concealed the stars
not a single light burned in the houses of the city no one was passing all of the streets and quays which could be seen were deserted notre dame and the towers of the courthouse seemed features of the night
a street lantern reddened the margin of the quay
the outlines of the bridge clay shapeless in the most one behind the other
recent rains had swollen the river
the spot where javert was leaning was it will be remembered situated precisely over the rapids on the seine perpendicularly above that formidable spiral of whirlpools which loose and i got themselves again like an endless screw
never then this head and gazed
all was black
nothing was to be distinguished
a sound of foam was audible but the river could not be seen
at moments in that dizzy depth a gleam of light appeared and undulated vaguely water possessing the power of taking light no one knows whence and converting it into a snake
the light vanishes and all became indistinct once more
immensity seemed thrown open there
what lay below was not water it was a gulf
the wall of the quay abrupt confused mingled with the vapors instantly concealed from sight produced the effect of an escarpment of the infinite
nothing was to be seen but the hostile chill of the water and the stale odor of the wet stones could be felt
a fierce breath rose from this abyss
the flood in the river divine'd rather than perceived the tragic whispering of the waves the melancholy vastness of the arches of the bridge the imaginable fall into that gloomy void into all that shadow was full of horror
javert remained motionless for several minutes gazing at this opening of shadow be considered the invisible with a fixity that resembled attention
the water roared
all at once he took off his hat and placed it on the edge of the quay
a moment later at all black figure which a belated passerby in the distance might have taken for a phantom appeared erect upon the parapet of the quay bent over towards the seine they drew itself up again and fell straight down into the shadows a full splash followed and the shadow alone was in the secret of the convulsions of that obscure form which had disappeared beneath the water
book fifth
grandson and grandfather chapter i. in which the tree with the zinc plaster appears again sometime after the events which we have just recorded sux ur boulay ruelle experienced a lively emotion
sieur boulay ruelle was that road men serif mont vermeil whom the reader has already seen in the gloomy parts of this book
foul a true low as the reader may perchance recall was a man who was occupied with divers and troublesome matters
he broke stones and damaged travellers on the highway
road mender and thief as he was he cherished one dream he believed in the treasures buried in the forest of monte dr neil
he hoped someday to find the money in the earth at the foot of a tree in the meanwhile he lived to search the pockets of passersby
nevertheless for an instant he was prudent
he had just escaped neatly
he had been as the reader is aware picked up in job frette's garreton company with the other ruffians
utility of a vice his drunkenness had been his salvation
the authorities had never been able to make out whether he had been there in the quality of a robber or a man who had been robbed
an order of bolle prose qui founded on his well authenticated state of intoxication on the evening of the ambush had set him at liberty
he had taken to his heels
he had returned to his road from nanny to lanny to make under administrative supervision broken stone for the good of the state with downcast mien in a very pensive mood howard or for theft somewhat cooled but he was addicted nonetheless tenderly to the wine which had recently saved him
as for the lively emotion which he had experienced a short time after his return to his road mender's turf thatched so there it is one morning boulay ruelle while on his way as was his wont to his work and possibly also to his ambush a little before daybreak caught sight through the branches of the trees of a man whose back alone he saw but the shape of whose shoulders as it seemed to him at that distance and in the early disk was not entirely unfamiliar to him
boulay ruelle although intoxicated has a correct and lucid memory a defensive atm that is indispensable to anyone who is at all in conflict with legal order
where the deuce have i seen something like that many under
he said to himself
but he could make himself no answer except that the man resembled some one of whom his memory preserved a confused grace
however apart from the identity which he could not manage to catch go up at ruelle put things together and made calculations
this man did not belong in the countryside
he had just arrived there
on foot evidently
no public conveyance passed through mont vermeil at that hour
he had walked all night
when became he
not from a very great distance for he had neither habersack not bundle
from paris no doubt
why waste in these woods
why waste there at such an hour
what had become there for
boulay ruelle thought of the treasure
by dint of ransacking his memory he recalled in a vague way that he had already many years before had a similar alarm in connection with a man who produced on him the effect that he might well be this very individual
by the deuce said boulay ruelle i'll find him again
i'll discover the parish of that parishioner
this prowler of patron minette has a reason and i'll know it
peoplecan't have secrets in my forest if idon't have a finger in the pie
he took his pickaxe which was very sharply pointed
there now he grumbled is something that will search the earth and a man
and as one knots one thread to another thread he took up the line of march at his best pace in the direction which the man must follow and set out across the thickets
when he had compassed a hundred strides the day which was already beginning to break came to his assistance
footprints stamped in the sand weeds trodden down here and there heather crushed young branches in the brushwood bent and in the act of straightening themselves up again with the graceful deliberation of the arms of a pretty woman who stretches herself when she wakes pointed out to him a sort of track
he followed it then lost it
time was flying
he plunged deeper into the woods and came to a sort of eminence
an early huntsman who was passing in the distance along a path whistling the air off hillery suggested to him the idea of climbing a tree
old as he was he was a file
there stood close at hand a beech tree of great size worthy of to the usage of boulay ruelle
boulay ruelle ascended the beech as high as he was able
the idea was a good one
on scrutinizing the solitary waste on the side where the forest is thoroughly entangled and wild boulay ruelle suddenly caught sight of his man
hardly had he got his eye upon him when he lost sight of him
the man entered or rather glided into an open glare at a considerable distance masked by large trees but with which foul a true ile was perfectly familiar on account of having noticed near a large pile of porous stones an ailing chestnut tree bandaged with a sheet of zinc mailed directly upon the bark
this glade was the one which was formerly called the blaeu bottom
the heap of stones destined for no one knows what employment which was visible there thirty years ago is doubtless still there
nothing equals a heap of stones in longevity unless it is a board fence
they are temporary expedients
what a reason for lasting
boulay ruelle with the rapidity of joy dropped rather than descended from the tree
the pair was unearthed the question now was to seize the feast
that famous treasure of his dreams was probably there
it was no small matter to reach that blade
by the beaten paths which indulge in a thousand reading zigzags it requires a good quarter of an hour
in a beeline through the underbrush which is peculiarly sense very thorny and very aggressive in that locality a full half hour was necessary
boulay ruelle committed the error or not comprehending this
he believed in the straight line a respectable optical illusion which ruins many a man
the thicket bristling as it was struck him as the best road
let's take to the wolves' rue de rivoli said he
boulay ruelle accustomed to taking crooked courses was on this occasion guilty of the fault of going straight
he flung himself resolutely into the tangle of undergrowth
he had to deal with holly bushes nettles hawthorne eglantine's thistles and very irascible brambles
he was much lacerated
at the bottom of the ravine he found water which he was obliged to traverse
at last he reached the blaeu bottom after the lapse of forty minutes sweating soaked breathless scratched and ferocious
there was no one in the blade
boulay ruelle rushed to the heap of stones
it was in its place
it had not been carried off
as for the man he had vanished in the forest
he had made his escape
where
in what direction
into what thicket
impossible to guess
and heartrending to say there behind the pile of stones in front of the tree with the sheet of sins was freshly turned earth a pickaxe abandoned or forgotten and a hole
the hole was empty
thief
shrieked boulay ruelle shaking his fist at the horizon
chapter ii marius emerging from civil war makes ready for domestic war for a long time marius was neither dead not alive
for many weeks he lay in a fever accompanied by delirium and by tolerably grave cerebral symptoms caused more by the shocks of the wounds on the head than by the wounds themselves
he repeated cosette's name for whole nights in the melancholy low us city of fever and with the sombre obstinacy of agony
the extent of some of the lesions presented a serious danger the supp uration of large wounds being always liable to become reabsorbed and consequently to kill the sick man under certain atmospheric conditions at every change of weather at the slightest storm the physician was uneasy
above all things he repeated let the wounded man be subjected to no emotion
the dressing of the wounds was complicated and difficult the fixation of apparatus and bandages by free cloths not having been invented as yet at that epoch
nicolette used up a sheet as big as the ceiling as she put it for lint
it was not without difficulty that the chloride free lotions and then it rate of silver overcame the gangrene
as long as there was any danger m
ville norm and seated in despair at his grandson's pillow was like marius neither alive not dead
everyday sometimes twice a day a very well dressed gentleman with white hair such was the description given by the porter came to inquire about the wounded man and left a large package of lint for the dressings
finally ont meth of september four months to a day after the sorrowful night when he had been brought back to his grandfather in a dying condition the doctor declared that he would answer for marius
convalescence began
but marius was forced to remain for two months more stretched out on a long chair on account of the results called up by the fracture of his collarbone
there always is a last doug's like that which will not close and which prolongs the dressings indefinitely to the great annoyance of the sick person
however this long illness and this long convalescence saved him from all pursuit
in france there is no wrath not even if a public character which six months will not extinguish
revolts in the present state of society are so much the fault of everyone that they are followed by a certain necessity of shutting the eyes
let us add that the inexcusable bosquet order which enjoined doctors to lodge information against the wounded having outraged public opinion and not opinion alone but the king first of all the wounded were covered and protected by this indignation and with the exception of those who had been made prisoners in the very act of combat the councils of war did not dare to trouble anyone
so marius was left in peace
m
ville normand first passed through all manner of anguish and then through every form of ecstasy
it was found difficult to prevent his passing every night beside the wounded man he had his big arm chair carried to marius' bedside me required his daughter to take the finest linen in the house for compresses and bandages
mademoiselle ville norman'd like a safe and elderly person contrived to spare the fine linen while allowing the grandfather to think that he was obeyed
m
ville norm and would not permit anyone to explain to him that for the preparation of long batiste is not nearly so good as coarse linen not newline basile linen
he was present at all the dressings of the wounds from which mademoiselle ville norm and modestly absentee herself
when the dead flesh was cut away with scissors he said aid
aye
no thing was more touching than to see him with his gentle senile palsy offer the wounded man a cup of his cooling draught
he overwhelmed the doctor with questions
he did not observe that he asked the same ones over and over again
on the day when the doctor announced to him that marius was out of danger the good man was in a delirium
he made his porter a present of three louis
that evening on his return to his own chamber he dances a gavotte using his thumb and forefinger as castanets and he sang the following song jeanne esther about dream our t u v use belle brain isd' une bergere carc'est can swap run ellej'adore sony upon que tu mercy on car whois
grip on
marqui is
no one la chantreyj'aime plus que diane meme jeanne et ses first stone bretons
love thou dwell est in her for' tis in her eyes that thou place at thy quivers lys camo
as for me using her and i love more than diana herself jeanne and her firm breton breasts
then he knelt upon a chair and basque who was watching him through the half open door made sure that he was praying
up to that time he had not believed in god
at each succeeding phase of improvement which became more and more pronounced the grandfather raves
he executed a multitude of mechanical actions full of joy he ascended and descended the stairs without knowing why
a pretty female neighbor was amazed one morning at receiving a big bouquet it was m.
ville norm and who had sent it timer
the husband made a jealous scene
m
ville norm and tried to draw nicolette upon his knees
he called marius m
lebaron
he shouted long live the republic
every moment he kept asking the doctor is he no longer in danger
he gazed upon marius with the eyes of a grandmother
he brooded over him while he ate
he no longer knew himself he no longer rendered himself an account of himself
marius was the master of the house there was abdication in his joy he was the grandson of his grandson
in the state of joy in which he then as she was the most venerable of children
in his fear lest he might fatigue or annoy the convalescent he stepped behind him to smile
he was content joyous delighted charming young
his white locks added a gentle majesty to the gay radiance of his visage
when grace is mingled with wrinkles it is adorable
there is an indescribable aurora in beaming old age
as for marius as he allowed them to dress his wounds and cars for him he had but one fixed idea cosette
after the fever and delirium had left him he did not again pronounce her name and it might have been supposed that he no longer thought of her
he held his peace precisely because his soul was there
he did not know what had become of cosette the whole affair of the rue de la chambre did was like a cloud in his memory shadows that were almost indistinct floated through his minde login eg abroche have if the the barriers all his friends gloomily intermingled with the smoke of the barricade the strange passage of m
gauche le vent through that adventure produced on him the effect of a puzzle in a tempest he understood nothing connected with his own life he did not know how nor by whom he had been saved and no one of those around him knew this all that they had been able to tell him was that he had been brought home at night in a hackney coach to the rue des filles ducal c wire past present future were nothing more to him than the most of a vague idea but it that for there was one immovable point one clear and precise outline something made of granite a resolutions will to find cosette once more
for him the idea of life was not distinct from the idea of cosette
he had decreed in his heart that he would not accept the one without the other and he was in nova boy resolved to exact of any person whatever who should desire to force him to live from his grandfather from date from hell the restitution of his vanished eden
he did not conceal from himself the fact that obstacles existed
let us here emphasize one detail he was not win over and was but little softened by all the solicitude and tenderness of his grandfather
in the first place he was not in the secret then in his reveries of an invalid which were still feverish possibly be distrusted this tenderness as a strange and novel thing which had for its object how conquest
he remained cold
the grandfather absolutely wasted his poor old smile
marius said to himself that it was all right so long as he marius did not speak and let things take their course but that when it became a question of cosette he would find another face and that his grandfather's true attitude would be unmasked
then there would be an unpleasant scene are crud essence of family questions a confrontation of positions every sort of sarcasm and all manner of objections at one and the same time gauche le vent coupe le vent fortune poverty a stone about his neck the future
violent resistance conclusion a refusal
marius stiffened himself in advance
and then in proportion as he regained life the old ulcers of his memory opened once more he reflected again on the past colonel pont mercy placed himself once more between m
bolle normand and him marius he told himself that he had not the kindness to expect from a person who had been so unjust and so hard to his father
and with health there returned to him a sort of harshness towards his grandfather
the old man was gently pained by this
m
ville norm and without however allowing it to appear observed that marius ever since the latter had been brought back to him and had regained consciousness had not once called him father
it is true that he did not say monsieur to him but he contrived not to say either the one of the other by means of a certain way of turning his phrases
obviously a crisis was approaching
as almost always happens in such cases marius skirmishes before giving battle by way of proving himself
this is called feeling the ground
one morning it came to pass that m
ville norm and spokes lighting lyon the convention apropos of a newspaper which had fallen into his hands and gave vent to a royalist harangue on canton saint judge and robespierre
the men of' were giants said marius with severity
the old man held his peace and uttered not a sound during the remainder of that day
marius who had always present to his mind the inflexible grandfather of his early years interpreted this silence as a profound concentration of wrath sutured from its not conflict and augmented his preparations for the fray in the utmost recesses of his mind
he decided that in case of a refusal he would tear off his bandages dislocate his collarbone that he would lay bare all the wounds which he had left and would reject all food
his wounds were his munitions of war
he would have cosette or die
he awaited the propitious moment with the crafty patience of the sick
that moment arrived
chapter iii marius attacked one day m
ville norm and while his daughter was putting in order the l goals and cups on the marble of the commode bent over marius and said to him in his tenderest accents look here my little marius if i were in your place i would eat meat now in preference to fish
a fried sole is excellent to begin a convalescence with but a good cutlet is needed to put a sick man on his feet
marius who had almost entirely recovered his strength collected the whole of it drew himself up into a sitting posture laid his two clenched fists on the sheets of his bed looked his grandfather in the face assumed a terrible air and said this leads me to say something to you
what is it
that i wish to marry
agreed said his grandfather
and he burst out laughing
how agreed
yes agreed
you shall have your little girl
marius stunned and overwhelmed with the dazzling shock trembled in every limb
m
ville norm and went on yea you shall have her that pretty little girl of yours
she comes every day in the shape of an old gentleman to inquire after you
ever since you were wounded she has passed her time in weeping and making lint
i have made inquiries
she lives in the rue del' homme arms no
aj
there we have it
ah
so you want her
well you shall have her
you're caught
you had arranged your little plot you had said to yourself' i'm going to signify this squarely to my grandfather to that mummy of the regency and of the directory to that ancient be auto that for an returned g front she has indulged in his frivolities also that he has and he has had his love affairs and hist rosettes and his cosette she has made his rustle he has had his wings he has eaten of the bread of spring he certainly must remember it
' ah

that's good
i offer you a cutler and you answer me' by the way i want to marry
' there's a transition for you
ah

lawyer and that's vexatious

i have had an idea ever since you have been better or simply planting her at your bedside but it is only in romances that young girls are brought to the bed sides of handsome young wounded men who interest them
it is not done
what would your aunt have said to it
you were nude three quarters of the time my goodfellow
ask nicolette who has not left you for a moment if there was any possibility of having a woman here
and then what would the doctor have said
a pretty girl does not cure a man of fever
in short it's all right let us say no more about it all'd said all's done it's all settled take her
such is my ferocity
you see i perceived that you did not love me
i said to myself' here now i have my little cosette right under my hand i'm going to give her to him he will be obliged to love me a little them or he must tell the reason why
' ah
so you thought that the old man was going to storm to put on a big voice to shout mo and to lift his cane at all that aurora
not a bit of it
cosette albeit loved one if i ask nothing better
pray take the trouble of getting married for
be happy my well beloved child
that said the old man burst forth into sons
and he seized marius' head and pressed it with both arms against his breast and both fell to weeping
this is one of the forms of supreme happiness
father
cried marius
ah so you love me
said the old man
an ineffable moment ensued
they were choking and could not speak
at length the old man stammered come
his mouth is in stopped at last
he has said' father' home
marius disengaged his head from his grandfather's arms and said gently but rather now that i am quite well it seems to me that i might see her
agreed again you shall see her tomorrow
father
what
why not today
well today they
let it be today
you have called me' father' three times and it is worth it
i will attend to it

agreed i tell you
it has already been put into verse

ville norm and clutched by the throat by his own phrase could not proceed
being able neither to finish it not to retract it while his daughter arranged the pillow behind marius who was overwhelmed with so many emotions the old man rushed headlong with as much validity as his age permitted from the bedchamber shut the door behind him and purple choking and foaming at the mouth his eyes starting from his head he found himself nose to nose with honest basque who was blacking biota in the anteroom
he seized basque by the collar and shouted typo in his face in fury by the hundred thousand ja vortex of the devil those ruffians did assassinate him

there are things which one must not attempt to depict the sun is one of them
the entire family including basque and nicolette were assembled in marius' chamber at the moment when cosette entered it
precisely at that moment the grandfather was on the point of blowing his nose he stopped short holding his nose in his handkerchief and gazing over it at cosette
she appeared on the threshold it seemed to him that she was surrounded by a glory
adorable
he exclaimed
then he blew his nose noisily
cosette was intoxicated delighted frightened in heaven
she was as thoroughly alarmed as anyone can be by happiness
she stammered all pale yet flushed she wanted to flung herself into marius' arms and dared not
ashamed of living in the presence of all these people
people are pitiless towards happy lovers they remain when the latter most desire to be left alone
lovers have no need of any people whatever
with cosette and behind her there had entered a man with white hair who was grave yet smiling though with a vague and heartrending smile
it was monsieur gauche le vent it was jean valjean
he was very well dressed as the porter had said entirely on black in perfectly new garments and with a white cravat
the porter was a thousand leagues from recognizing in this correct bourgeois in this probable notary the fear inspiring bead st. of the corpse who has sprung up at his door on the night of the thor june tattered muddy hideous haggard his face masked in blood and more supporting in his arms the fainting marius still his porter's scent was aroused
when i
fancy el event arrived with cosette the porter had not been able to refrain from communicating to his wife this aside idon't know why it is but ican't help fancying that i've seen that face before
m
faux held dent in marius' chamber remained a part near the door
he had under his arms package which bore considerable resemblance to an octavo volume enveloped in paper
the enveloping paper was of a greenish hue and appeared to be mouldy
does the gentleman always have books like that under his arm
mademoiselle ville norm and who did not like books demanded in a low tone of nicolette
well retorted m
ville norm and who had overheard her in the same time he's a learned man
what then
is that his fault
monsieur foul are one of my acquaintances never walked out without a book under his arms other and he always had some old volume hugged to his heart like that
and with a bow he said aloud monsieur tranche le vent
father ville norm and did not do it intentionally but inattention to proper names was an aristocratic habit of his
monsieur tranche le vent i have the honor of asking you on behalf of my grandson baron marius pont mercy for the hand of mademoiselle
monsieur tranche le vent bowed
that's settled said the grandfather
and turning to marius and cosette with both arms extended in blessing he cried permission to adore each other
they did not require him to repeat it twice
so much the worse
the chirping began
they talked low
marius resting on his elbow on his reclining chair cosette standing beside him
on heavens
murmured cosette i see you once again
it is thou
it is you
the idea of going and fighting like that
but why
it is horrible
i have been dead for four months
oh
how wicked it was of you to go to that battle
what had i done to you
i pardon you but you will never do it again
a little while ago when they came to tell us to come to you i still thought that i was about to die but it was from joy
i was so sad
i have not taken the time to dress myself i must frighten people with my looks
what will your relatives way to see me in a crumpled collar
do speak
you let me do all the talking
we are still in the rue del' homme arms
it seems that your shoulder was terrible
they told me that you would put your fist in it
and then it seems that they cut your flesh with the scissors
that is frightful
i have cried toll i have no eyes left
it is queer that a person can suffer like that
your grandfather has a very kindly air
don't disturb yourselfdon't rise on your elbow you will injure yourself
oh
how happy i am
so our unhappiness is over
i am quite foolish
i had things to say to you and i no longer know in the least what they were
do you still love me
we live in the rue del' homme arms
there is no garden
in a felony all the time stays it look it is your fault i have a callous on my fingers
angel
said marius
angel is the only word in the language which can not be worn out
no other word could resist the merciless use which lovers make of it
then as there were spectators they paused and said not a word more content int themselves with softly touching each other's hands
m
gillen of hand turned towards those who were in the room and cried talk loud the rest of you
make a noise you people behind the scenes
come a little uproar the deuce
so that the children can chatter at their ease
and approaching marius and rosette he said to them in a very low voice call each other thou
don't stand on ceremony
aunt guile norm and looked on in amazement at this i eruption of light in her elderly household
there was nothing aggressive about this amazement it was not the least in the world like the scandalized and envious glance of an owl at two turtle doves it was the stupid eye of a poor innocent seven and fifty years of age it was alive which had been a failure gazing at that triumph love
mademoiselle ville norm and senior said her father to her i told you that this is what would happen to you
he remained silent for a moment and then added look at the happiness of others
then he turned to cosette
how pretty she is
how pretty she is
she's an reuse
so you are going to have that all to yourself you scamp
ah
my rogue you are getting off nicely with me you are happy if i were not fifteen years too old we would fight with swords to see who chorus should have her
come now
i am in love with you mademoiselle
it's perfectly simple
it is your right
you are in the right
ah
what a sweet charming little wedding this will make
our parish is saint denis du saint sacrament but i will get a dispensation so that you can be married at saint paul
the church is better
it was built by the jesuits
it is more coquettish
it is opposite the fountain of cardinal web league
the masterpiece of jesuit architecture is at namur
it is called saint logo
you must go there after you are married
it is worth the journey
mademoiselle i am quite of your mind i think girls ought to marry that is what they are made for
there is a certain sainte catherine whom i should always like to see in coiffed
it's a fine thing to remain a spinster but it is chilly

in order to save the people jeanned' arc is needed but in order to make people what is needed is mother goose
so marry my beauties
i really do not see the use in remaining a spinster
i know that they have their chapel a part in the church and that they fall back on the society of the virgin but capriati a handsome husband a fine fellow and at the expiration of a year a big blind beat who nurses lustily and who has fine rolls of war on his thighs and whom he sex up your breast in handfuls with his little rosy pass laughing the whole like the dawn that's better than holding a candle at vespers and changing the rise burns a

by the way
what is it father
have not you an intimate friend
yes source trac
what has become of him
he is dead
that is good
he seated himself near them made cosette sit down and took their four hands in his aged and wrinkled hands she is exquisite this darling
she's a masterpiece this cosette
she is a very little girl and a very great lady
she will only be a baroness which is a come down for her she was born a marquise

your beautiful white hands madame la baronne will do the devil the honor of pulling him by the tail
at this point they heard a grave and tranquil voice say mademoiselle euph easier such el scent possesses six hundred thousand francs
it was the voice of jean valjean
so far he had not uttered a single word no one seemed to be aware that he was there and he had remained standing erect and motionless behind all these happy people
what has mademoiselle e ultra due to do with the question
inquired the startled grandfather
i am she replied cosette
six hundred thousand francs
resumed m
ville normand
minus fourteen or fifteen thousand francs possibly said jean valjean
and he laid on the table the package which mademoiselle ville norm and had mistaken for a book
jean valjean himself opened the package it was a bundle of banknotes
they were turned over and counter
there were five hundred notes for a thousand francs each and one hundred and sixty eight of five hundred
in all five hundred and eighty four thousand francs
this is a fine book salem
ville normand
five hundred and eighty four thousand francs
murmured the aunt
this arranges things well does it hot mademoiselle ville norm and senior
said the grandfather
that devil of a marius has ferrets court behest of a millionaire g rosette in his tree of dreams
just trust to the love affairs of young folks now will you
students find student essex with six hundred thousand francs
cherubini works better than rothschild
five hundred and eighty four thousand francs
repeated mademoiselle ville normandin a low tone
five hundred and eighty four
one night as well say six hundred thousand
as for marius and cosette they were gazing at each other while this was going on they hardly needed this detail
chapter v deposit your money in a forest rather than with a notary the reader has no doubt understood without necessitating a lengthy explanation that jean valjean after the champ mathieu affair had been able thanks to his first escape of a few days' duration to come to paris and to withdraw in season from the hands of laffitte the sum earned by jim under the name of monsieur madeleine at montreuil sur mer and that fearing that he might be recaptured which eventually happened he had buried and hidden that sum in the border of mont vermeil in the locality known as the blaeu bottom
the sum six hundred and thirty thousand francs all on bank bills was not very bulky and was contained in a box only in order to preserve the box from dampness he had placed it in a coffee filled with chestnut shavings
in the same coffee he had placed his other treasures the bishop's candlesticks
it will be remembered that he had carried off the candlesticks when he made his escape from montreuil sur mer
the man seen one evening for the first time by boulay ruelle was jean valjean
later on every time that jean valjean needed money he went to get it in the blaeu bottom
hence the absences which we have mentioned
he had a pickaxe somewhere in the heather in a hiding place known to himself alone
when he beheld marius convalescent feeling that the hour was at hand when that money might prove of service he had gone to get it it was he again whom foul a true low had seen in the woods but on this occasion in the morning instead of in the evening
boy latreille inherited his pickaxe
the actual sum was five hundred and eighty four thousand five hundred francs
jean valjean withdrew the five hundred francs for himself
we shall see here after he thought
the difference between that cum and the six hundred and thirty thousand francs withdrawn from laffitte represented his expenditure in ten years from to
the five years of his stay in the convent had cost only five thousand francs
jean valjean set the two candlesticks on the chimney piece where they glittered to the great admiration of toussaint
moreover jean valjean knew that he was delivered from javert
the story had been told in his presence and he had verified the fact in the moniteur how a police inspector named javert had been found drowned under a goat belonging to some la undresses between the long au change and the pont neuf and that a writing left by this man otherwise irreproachable and highly esteemed by his superiors pointed to a bit of mental aberration and a suicide
in fact thought jean valjean since he left me at liberty once having got me in his power he must have been already had
chapter di the two old men do everything each one after his own fashion to render cosette happy everything was made ready for the wedding
the doctor on being consulted declared that it might take place in february
it was then december
a few ravishing weeks of perfect happiness passed
the grandfather was not the least happy of the mall
he remained for a quarter of an hour at a time gazing at cosette
the wonderful beautiful girl
he exclaimed
and she has so sweet and food an air
she is without exception the most charming girl that i have ever seen in my life
later on she'll have virtues with an odor of violets
how graceful
one can not live otherwise than non lj with such a creature
marius my boy you are a baron you are richdon't not post to fogging i beg of you
cosette and marius had passed abruptly from the sepulchre to paradise
the transition had not been softened and they would have been stunned had they not been dazzled by it
do you understand anything about it
said marius to cosette
no replies cosette but it seems to me that the good god is caring for us
jean valjean did everything smoothed away every difficulty arranged everything made everything easy
he hastened towards cosette's happiness with as much ardor and apparently with as much joy as cosette herself
as he had been a major he understood how to solve that delicate problem with the secret of which he alone was acquainted cosette's civil static
if he were to announce her origin bluntly it might prevent the marriage who knows
he fabricated cosette from all difficulties
he concocted for her a family of dead people a sure means of not encountering any objections
cosette was the only scion of an extinct family cosette was not his own daughter but the daughter of the other gauche le vent
two brothers gauche le vent had been gardeners to the convent of the petit pick us
inquiry was made at that convent the very best information and the most respectable references abounded the hood nun's not very apt and but little inclined to fathom questions of paternity and not attaching any importance to the matter had never understood exactly of which of the two gauche l events cosette was the daughter
they said what was wanted and they said it with zeal
an acte de motorists was drawn up
cosette became in the eyes of the law mademoiselle eu put aside such eleven t
she was declared an orphan both father and mother being dead
jean valjean so arranged it that he was appointed under the name of gauche i event as cosette's guardian with m
ville norman was supervising guardian over tim
as for the five hundred and eighty thousand francs they constituted a legacy bequeathed to cosette by a dead person who desired to remain unknown
the original legacy had consisted of five hundred and ninety four thousand francs but ten thousand francs had been expended on the education of mademoiselle sup head of five thousand francs of that amount having been paid to the convent
this legacy deposited in the hands on a third party was to be turned over to cosette at her majority of at the fate of her marriage
this taken as a whole was very acceptable as the reader will perceive especially when the sum due was half a million
there were some peculiarities here and there it is true but they were not noticed one of the interested parties had his eyes blindfolded by love the others by the six hundred thousand francs
cosette learned that she was not the daughter of that old man whom she had so long called father
he was merely a kinsman another rauch eleven teacher real father
at any other time this would have broken her heart
but at the ineffable moment which she was then passing through it fast but a slight shadow a faint cloud and she was so full of joy that the cloud did not last long
she had marius
the young man arrived the old man was effaced such is life
and then rosette had for long years been habituated to seeing enigmas around her every being who has had a mysterious childhood is always prepared for certain denunciations
nevertheless she continued to call jean valjean father
cosette happy as the angels was enthusiastic over father ville normand
it is true that he overwhelmed her with gallant compliments and presents
while jean valjean was building up for cosette a normal situation in society and an unassailable status m
ville norm and was superintending the basket of wedding gifts
nothing so amused him as being magnificent
he had given to cosette adobe of bunche gui pure which had descended to him from his own grandmother
these fashions come up again said he ancient things are the rage and the young women of my old age dress like the old women of my childhood
he rifles his respectable chests of drawers in coromandel lacquer with swelling fronts which had not been opened for years
let us hear the confession of these dowager she said let us see what they have in their launches
he noisily violated the pot bellied drawers of all his wives of all his mistresses and of all his grandmother's

cosette amazed desperately in love with marius and wild with gratitude towards m
gillen oem and dreamed of a happiness without limit clothed in satin and velvet
her wedding basket seemed to her to be upheld by seraphim
her soul else out into the azure depths with wings of mech link ace
the intoxication of the lovers was only equalled as we have already said by the ecstasy of the grandfather
a sort of flourish of trumpets went on in the rue des filles ducal faire
every morning a fresh offering of bric a brac from the grandfather to cosette
all possible knick knacks glittered around her
one day marius who was fond of talking gravely in the midst of his bliss said apropos of i know not what incident the men of the revolution are so great that they have the prestige of the ages like cato and like pulsion and each one of them seems to me an antique memory
moore antique
exclaimed the old gentleman
thanks marine
that is precisely the idea of which i was in search
and on the following day a magnificent dress of tea rose colored moore antique was added to cosette's wedding presents
from these gripper ies the grandfather extracted a bit of wisdom
love is all very well but there must be something else to go with it
the useless must be mingled with happiness
happiness is only the necessary
season that enormously with the superfluous for me
a palace and her heart
her heart and the louvre
her heart and the grand water works of versailles
give me my shepherd esd and try to make her a duchess
fetch me phyllis crowned with corn flowers and add a hundred thousand francs income
open for me a bucolic perspective as far as you can see beneath a marble colonnade
i consent to the bucolic and also to the fairy spectacle of marble and gold
dry happiness resembles dry bread
one eats but one does not find
i want the superfluous the useless the extravagant excess that which serves no purpose
i remember to have seen in the cathedral of strasburg a clock as tall as a three story house which marked the hours which had the kindness to indicate the hour but which had not the air of being made for that and which after having struck midday or midnight midday the hour of the synod midnight the hour of love or any other hour that you like gave you the moon and the stars the earth and the sea birds and fishes phoebus and phoebe and a host of things which emerged from a niche and the twelve apostles and the emperor charles the fifth and epo nine and cabin us and a throng of little gilded good men who played on the trumpet to boot
without reckoning delicious chimes which it sprinkled through the air on every occasion without anyone's knowing why
is a petty bald clock face which merely tells the hour equal to that
for my part i am of the opinion of the big clock of strasburg and i prefer it to the cuckoo clock from the black forest

while the grandfather in full lyrical effusion was listening to himself cosette and marius free intoxicated as they gazed freely at each other
aunt ville norm and surveyed all this with her imperturbable pl acidity
within the last five or six months she had exp ff i ended a certain amount of emotions
marius returned marius brought back bleeding marius brought back from a barricade marius dead then living marius reconciled marius betrothed marius weddings poor girl marius weddings millionairess
the six hundred thousand francs had been her last surprise
then her indifference of a girl taking her first communion returned to her
she went regularly to service told her bears read here is nology mumble waves in one corner of the house while i love you was being whispered in the other and she beheld marius and cosette in a vague way like two shadows
the shadow was herself
there is a certain state of inert asceticism in which the soul neutralized by torpor a stranger to that which may be designated as the business of living receives no impressions either human or pleasant or painful with the exception of earth quake's and catastrophes
this devotion as gather ville norm and said to his daughter corresponds to a cold in the head
you shell nothing of life
neither any bad nor any good odor
moreover the six hundred thousand francs had settled the elderly spinster's indecision
her father had acquired the habit of taking her so little into account that he had not consulted her in the matter of consent to marius' marriage
he had acted impetuously according to his wont having a despot turned slave but a single thought to satisfy marius
as for the aunt it had not even occurred to him that the sun resisted and that she could have an opinion of her own and sheep as she was this had vexed her
somewhat resentful in her in most soul but impassive externally she has said to herself my father has settled the question of the marriage without reference to me i shall settle the question of the inheritance without consulting him
she was rich in fact and her father was not
she had reserved her decision on this point
it is probable that had the match been a poor ones he would have left him poor
so much the worse for my nephew
he is wedding a beggar let him be a beggar himself
but cosette's half million pleased the aunt and altered her onward situation so far as this pair of lovers were concerned
one owes some consideration to six hundred thousand francs and it was evident that she could not do otherwise than leave her fortune to these young people since they did not need it
it was arranged that the couple should live with the grandfather m
ville norm and insisted on designing to them his chamber the finest in the house
that will make me young again he said
it's an old plan of mine
i have always entertained the idea of having a wedding in my chamber
he furnished this chamber with a multitude of elegant trifles
he had the ceiling and wa listing with an extraordinary stuff which he had by him in the piece and which he believed to have emanated from utrecht with a buttercup colored satin ground covered with velvet zurich la blossoms
it was with that stuff said he that the bed of the duchessed' and i'll eat la roche guyon was draped
on the chimney piece he set a little figure in case porcelain carrying a muff against her nude stomach
m
villa norm and's library became the lawyer's study which marius needed a study it will be remembered being required by the council of the order
chapter vii the effects of dreams mingled with happiness the lovers saw each other everyday
cosette came with m

this is reversing things said mademoiselle gillen or hand to have the bride come to the house to do the courting like this
but marine' convalescence had caused the habit to become established and the arm chairs of the rue des filles ducal faire better adapted to interviews than the straw chairs of the rue del' homme arms had root edit

he accepted it
by dint of discussing political matters vaguely and without precision from the point of view of the general amelioration of the fate of all men they came to say a little more than yes and no
once on the subject of education which marius wished to have free and obligatory multiplied under all forms lavished on everyone like the air and the sun in a word respirable for the entire population they were in unison and they almost conversed
m
gauche le vent talked well and even with a certain loftiness of languages till he lacked something indescribable
m
gauche le vent possessed something less and also something more than a man of the world
marius inwardly and in the depths of his thought surrounded with all sorts of mute questions this m.
gauche le vent who was to him simply benevolent and cold
there were moments when doubts as to his own recollections occurred to him
there was avoiding is melody a black spot an abyss excavated by four months of agony
many things had been lost there in
he had come to the point of asking himself whether it were really a fact that he had seen m
rauch eleven two serious and so calm a man in the barricade
this was not however the only stupor which the apparitions and the disappearances of the past had left in his mind
it must not be supposed that he was delivered from all those obsessions of the memory which force is even when happy even when satisfied to glance sadly behind us
the head which does not turn backwards towards horizons that have vanished contains neither thought not love
at times marius clasped his face between his hands and the vague and tumultuous past traversed the twilight which reigned in his brain

he questioned himself he felt himself all these vanished realities made him dizzy
where were they all the n
was it really true that all were dead
a fall into the shadows has carried off all except himself
it all seemed to him to have disappeared as though behind the curtain of a theatre
there are curtains like this which drop in life
god passes into the following act
and he himself was he actually the same man
he the poor man was rich be the abandoned had a family me the despairing was to marry cosette
it seemed to him that he had traversed a tomb and that he had entered into it black and had emerged from it white and in that tomb the others had remained
at certain moments all these beings of the past returned and present formed a circle around him and overshadowed him then he thought of cosette and recovered his serenity but nothing less than this felicity could have sufficed to efface that catastrophe
k
gauche le vent almost occupied a place among these vanished beings
marius hesitated to believe that the gauche l event of the barricade was the same as this gauche le vent in flesh and blood sitting so bravely besides odette
the first was probably one of those nightmares occasioned and brought back by his hours of delirium
however the natives of both men were rigid no question from mario atom
gauche l event was possible
such an idea had not even occurred to him
we have already indicated this characteristic detail
two men who have a secret in common and who by a sort of tacit agreement exchange not a word on the subject are less rate than is commonly supposed
once only did marius make the attempt
he introduced into the conversation the rue de la chambre died returning to m
f such eleven the said to him of course you are acquainted with that street
what street
the rue de la chambre rie
i have no idea of the name of that street replied m
gauche le vent in the most natural manner in the world
the response which fire upon the name of the street and not upon the street itself appeared to marius to be more conclusive than it really was
decidedly though the i have been dreaming
i have been subject to a hallucination
it was someone who resembles him
m
gauche l event was not there
' chapter viii two men impossible to find marius' enchantment great as it was could not efface from his mind other preoccupations
while the wedding was in preparation and while awaiting the date fixed upon he caused difficult and scrupulous retrospective researches to be made
he owed gratitude in various quarters he owed it on his father's account he owed it in his own
there was the barrier there was the unknown man who had brought him markus back to m
ville normand
marius endeavored to find these two men not intending to marry to be happy and to forget them and fearing that were these debts of gratitude not discharged they would leave a shadow on his life which promised so brightly for the future
it was impossible for him to leave all these arrests of suffering behind him and he wished before entering joyously into the future to obtain a quit tance from the last
that the barrier was a villain detracted nothing from the fact that he had saved colonel pont mercy
the barrier was a ruffian in the eyes of all the world except marius
and marius ignorant of the real scene in the battlefield of waterloo was not aware of the peculiar detail that his father so far as the barrier was concerned was in the strange position of being indebted to the latter for his life without being indebted to him for any gratitude
none of the various agents atom marius employee succeeded in discovering any trace of the barrier
obliteration appeared to be complete in that quarter
madame the barrier had died in prison lending the trial
the barrier and his daughters selma the only two remaining of that lamentable group had plunged back into the gloom
the gulf of the social unknown had silently closed above those beings
on the surface there was not visible so much as that quiver that trembling those obscure concentric circles which announce that something has fallen in and that the plummet may be dropped
madame the barrier being dead boulay ruelle being eliminated from the cases la que so is having disappeared the principal persons accused having escaped from prison the trial connected with the ambush in the forbes i house had come to nothing
that affair had remained rather obscure
the bench of assizes had been obliged to content themselves with two subordinates
page may dallas prints nude alias for demaille and remillard alias deux milliards who had been inconsistently condemned after a hearing of both sides of the case to ten years in the galleys
hard labor for kids had been the sentence pronounced against the escaped and contin a cloud accomplices
the barrier the head and leader had been through contin act likewise condemned to death
this sentence was the only information remaining about the barrier casting upon that buried name it's sinister might like a candle besides bier
moreover by thrusting the barrier back into the very remotest depths through a fear of being recaptured this sentence added to the density of the shadows which enveloped this man
as for the other person as for the unknown man who had saved marius there searches were at first to some extent successful then came to an abrupt conclusion
they succeeded in finding the carriage which has brought marius to the rue des filles ducal faire on the evening of the thorn in a
the coachman declared that ont meth of tune in obedience to the commands of a police agent he had stood from threeo'clock in the afternoon until nightfall on the quai des champs elysees above the outlet of the grand sewer that towards nineo'clock in the evening the grating of the sewer which abuts on the bank of the river had opened that a man had emerged therefrom bearing on his shoulders another man who seemed to be read that the agent who was on the watch at that point had arrested the living man and had seized the dead man that at the order of the police agent us the coachman had taken all those folks into miscarriage that they had first driven to the rue des filles ducal faire that they had there deposited the dead man that the dead man was monsieur marius and that he the coachman recognized him perfectly although he was alive this time that afterwards they had entered the vehicle again that he had whipped up his horse's a few paces from the gate of the archives they had called to him to halt that there in the street they had paid him and left him and that the police agent has led the other man away that he knew nothing more that the night had been very dark
marius as we have said recalled nothing
he only remembered that he had been seized from behind by an energetic hand at the moment when he was falling backwards into the barricade then everything vanished so far as he was concerned
he had only regained vincci oneness atm
guile norm and's
he was lost in conjectures
he could not doubt his own identity
still how had it come to pass that having fallen in the rue de la chambre did he had been picked up by the police agent on the banks of the seige near the pont des invalides
someone has carried him from the quartier des halles to the champs elysees
and how
through the sewer
unheard of devotion
someone
who
this was the man for whom marius was searching
of this man who was his savior nothing not a trace not the faintest indication
marius although forced to preserve great reserve in that direction pushed his inquiries as far as the prefer turf of police
there no more than elsewhere did the information obtained lead to any enlightenment
the prefecture knew less about the matter than did the hackney coachman
they had no knowledge of any arrest having been made on the gulf june at the mouth of the grand sewer
no report of any agent had been received thereupon this matter which was regarded at the prefecture as a fable
the invention of this table was attributed to the coachman
a coach man who wants a gratuity is capable of anything even of imagination
the fact was assured nevertheless and marius could not doubt it unless he doubted his own identity as we have just said
everything about this singular enigma was inexplicable
what had become of that man that mysterious man whom the coachman had seen emerge from the grating of the grand sewer bearing upon his back the unconscious marius and whom the police agent on the watch had arrested in the very act of rescuing an insurgent
what had become of the agent himself
why had this agent preserved silence
had the man succeeded in making his escape
had hebrides the agent
why did this man give no sign of life to marius who owed everything to him
his disinterested news was no less tremendous than his devotion
why had not that man appeared again
perhaps he was above compensation but no one is above gratitude
was made cd
who was the man
what sort of a race had he
no one could tell him this
the coachman answered the night was very dark
basque and nicolette all in a flutter had looked only at their young master all covered with blood
the porter whose candle had lighted the tragic arrival of marius had been the only one to take note of the man in question and this is the description that he gave that man was terrible
marius had the blood stained clothing which he had worn when he had been brought back to his grandfather preserved in the hope that it would prove of service in his researches
on examining the coat it was found that one skirt had been torn in a singular way
a piece was missing
one evening marius was speaking in the presence of cosette and jean valjean of the whole of that singular adventure of the innumerable inquiries which he had made and of the fruitless ness of his efforts
the cold countenance of monsieur gauche le vent angered him
he exclaimed with a vivacity which had something of wrath i got yes that man whoever he may have been was sublime
do you know what he did sid
he intervened like an archangel
he must have flung himself into the midst of the battle have stolen me away have opened the sewer have dragged me into it and have carried me through it
he must have traversed more than a league and a half in those frightful subterranean galleries bent over weighed down in the dark in the cesspool more than a league and a half air with a corpse upon his back
and with what object
with the sole object of saving the corpse
and that corpse i was
he said to himself' there may still be a glimpse of life there perchance i will risk my own existence for that miserables park
' and his existence he risked not once but twenty times
and every step was a danger
the proof of it is that on emerging from the sewer he was arrested
do you know sir that that man did all this
and he had no recompense to expect
what was i
an insurgent
what was i
one of the conquered
oh
if cosette's six hundred thousand francs were mine
they are yours interrupted jean valjean
well resumed marius i would give them all to find that man once more
jean valjean remained silent
book sixth
the sleepless night chapter other hot february the night of the tutor method february was a blessed night
above its shadows heaven stood open
it was the wedding night of marius and cosette
the day had been adorable
it had not been the grand festival dreamed by the grandfather a fairy spectacle with a confusion of cherubim and cupids over the heads of the bridal pairs marriage worthy to form the subject of a painting to be placed over a door but it had been sweet and smiling
the manner of marriage in was not the same as it is today
france had not yet borrowed from england that supreme delicacy of carrying off one's wife of fleeing on coming out of church of hiding oneself with shane from one's happiness and of combining the ways of a bankrupt with the delights of the song of songs
people had not yet grasped to the full the chastity exquisite news and decency of jolting their paradise in a posting chaise of breaking up their mystery with clic class of taking for a nuptial bed the bed of an innate of leaving behind them in a commonplace chamber at such a night the most sacred of the souvenirs of life mingled pelo help with the tetex tete of the conductor of the diligence and the maidservant of the inn
in this second half of the nineteenth century in which we are now living the mayor and his scarf the priest and mischa sublette law and god no longer suffice they must be eked out by the postilion delon juneau a blue waistcoat turned up with red and with bell buttons a plaque like avant brace knee breeches of green leather paths to the norman horses with their tails knotted up false balloons varnished hat long powdered locks an enormous whip and tall boots
france does not yet carry elegance to the length of doing like the english nobility and raining down on the post chaise of the bridal paid a hailstorm of slippers trodden down at heel and of worn out shoes in memory of churchill afterwards marlborough or map be luck who was assailed on his wedding day by the wrath of a gaunt which brought him good luck
old shoes and slippers do not as yet forms part of our nuptial celebrations but patience as good taste continues to spread we shall come to that
in a hundred years ago marriage was not conducted at a full troy
strange to say at that epoch people still imagined that a wedding was a private and social festival that a patriarchal banquet does not spoil a domestic solemnity that gayety even in excess provided it be honest and decent does happiness no harm and that in short it is a good and a venerable thing that the fusion of these two destinies whence a family is destined to spring should begin at home and that the household should thenceforth have its nuptial chamber as it's witness
and people were soon modest as to marry in their own homes
the marriage took place therefore in accordance with this now superannuated fashion atm
gillen or maid's house
natural and commonplace as this matter of marrying is the banns to publish the papers to be drawn up the mayoralty and the church produce some complication
they could not get ready before the th of february
now we note this detail for the life satisfaction of being exact it chanced that the th fell on shrove tuesday
hesitations scruples particularly on the part of aunty like normand
shrove tuesday
exclaimed the grandfather so much the better
there is a proverb' mariage in mardi gras n' aug a point enfants in grays
' let us proceed
here goes for the hh
do you want to delay marius
no certainly not
replied the lover
let us marry then cried the grandfather
accordingly the marriage took place on the hh notwithstanding the public merrymaking
it rained that day but there is always on the sky a tiny scrap of blue at the service of happiness which lovers see even when the rest of creation is under an umbrella
on the preceding evening jean valjean handed to marius in the presence of m
ville norm and the five hundred and eighty four thousand francs
as the marriage was taking place under the regime of community of property the papers had been simple
henceforth toussaint was of house to jean valjean cosette inherited her and promoted her to the rank of lady's maid
as for jean valjean a beautiful chamber in the hills normand house had been furnished expressly for him and cosette had said to him in such an irresistible manner father i entreat you that she had almost persuaded him to promise that he would come and occupy it
a few days before that fixed on for the marriage an accident happened to jean valjean he crushed the thumb of his right hand
this was not a serious matter and he had not allowed anyone to trouble himself about ign or goddess it not even to see his hurt not even cosette
nevertheless this had forced him to swathe his hand in a linen bandage and to carry his arm in a sling and has prevented his signing
m
ville normandin his capacity of cosette's supervising guardian had supplied his place
we will not conduct the reader either to the mayor's office or to the church
one does not follow a pair of lovers to that extent and one is accustomed to turn one's back on the drama as soon as it puts a wedding nosegay in its buttonhole
we will confine ourselves to noting an incident which though unnoticed by the wedding party marked the transit from the rue des filles ducal faire to the church of saint paul
at that epoch the northern extremity of the rue saint louis was in process of repaving
it was barred off beginning with the rue du page royal
it was impossible for the wedding carriages to go directly to saint paul
they were obliged to alter their course and the simplest way was to turn through the boulevard
one of the invited guests observed that it was shrove tuesday and that there would be a man of vehicles
why
asked m
ville norm and because of the hackers
capital said the grandfather let us to that way
these young folks are on the way to be married they are about to enter the serious part of life
this will prepare them for seeing a bit of the masquerade
they went by way of the boulevard
the first wedding coach held cosette and aunt gillen or hand m
ville normand and jean valjean
marius still separated from his betrothed according to usa he did not come until the second
the nuptial train on emerging from the rue des filles ducal faire became entangled in a long procession of vehicles which formed an endless chain from the madeleine to the bastille and from the bastille to the madeleine
hackers a bounded on the boulevard
in spite of the fact that it was raining at intervals merry andrew pantaloon and clown persisted
in the good humor of that winter of parishad disguised itself as venice
such shrove tuesday's are no longer to be seen nowadays
everything which exists being a scattered carnival there is no longer any carnival
the sidewalks were overflowing with pedestrians and the windows with curious spectators
the terraces which crown the perl styles of the theatres were bordered with spectators
besides the hackers they stared at that profession peculiar to shrove tuesday as to long champs of vehicles of every description citadines tapis sierra car jokes cabriolet's marching in order rigorously riveted to each other by the police regulations and locked into fails as it were
anyone in these vehicles is at once a spectator and a spectacle
police sergeant's maintained on the sides of the boulevard these two interminable parallel files moving in contrary directions and saw to it that nothing interfered with that double current those two brooks of carriages glowing the one downstream the other upstream the one towards the chausseed' ant in the other towards the faubourg saint antoine
the carriages of the peers of france and of the ambassadors emblazoned with coats of arms held the middle of the way going and coming freely
certain joyous and magnificent trains notably that of the boeuf gras had the same privilege
in this gayety of paris england cracked her whip lord seymour's posts baise harassed by a nickname from the populace passed with great house
in the double file along which the municipal guards galloped like sheep dog's honest family coaches loaded down with great aunts and grandmothers displayed at their doors fresh groups of children in disguise clowns of seven years of age column ones of six ravishing little creatures who felt that they formed an official part of the public north who were imbued with the dignity of their harlequin are and who possessed the gravity of functionaries
from time to time a hitch a rose somewhere in the procession of vehicles one or other of the two lateral files halted until the knot was risen tangled one carriage delayed sufficed to paralyze the whole line
then they set out again on the march
the wedding carriages were in the file proceeding towards the bastille and skirting the right side of the boulevard
at the top of the long aux choux there was a stoppage
nearly at the same moment the other file which was proceeding towards the madeleine halted also
at that point of the file there was a carriage load of hackers
these carriages or to speak more correctly these wagon loads of macker's are very familiar to parisians
if they were missing on a shrove tuesday or at the mid kent it would be taken in bad part and people would say there's something behind that
probably the ministry is about to undergo a change
a pile of cassandra's harlequins and columbine shoot sealing high above the passers by all possible grotesque nesses from the turk to the savage hercules supporting marquise's fishwives who would have made rabelais stop up his ears just as the magna rx made aristophanes drop his eyes to wait's pink rights d and it is what's spectacles of a grimaced three corners what sofia not tormented with a butterfly shouts directed at pedestrians fists of hip an old attitudes bare shoulders in modesty unchained a shape of shameless news driven by a coachman crowned with flowers this is what that institution was like
greece stood in need of the chariot of the epic trance stands in need of the hackney coach of care
everything can be parodied even parody
the saturnalia that grimace of antique beauty ends through exaggeration after exaggeration in shrove tuesday and the bacchanal formerly crowned with sprays of vine leaves and grapes inundated with sunshine displaying her marble breast in a divine semi nudity having at the present day lost her shape under the soaked days of the north has finally come to be called the jack pudding
the tradition of carriage loads of hackers runs back to the most ancient days of the monarchy
the accounts of louis xi
allot to the bailiff of the palace twenty sous tour noise or three coaches of mascara dec in the crossroads
in our way these noisy heaps of creatures are accustomed to have themselves driven in some ancient cuckoo carriage whose imperial they load down or they overwhelm a hired landau with its top thrown back with their tumultuous groups
twenty of them ride in a carriage intended for six
they cling to the seats to the rumble on the cheeks of the hood on the shafts
they even best ride the carriage lamps
they stands it lie with their knees drawn up in a knot and their legs hanging
the women sit on the men's laps
far away above the throng of heads their wild pyramid is visible
these carriage loads form mountains of mirth in the midst of the root
coll epa hard and put on flow from it enriched with slang
this carriage which has become colossal through its freight has an aid of conquest
uproar reigns in front tumult behind
people vocoder a test out how it here they break forth and writhe with enjoyment take the mars sarcasm flames forth jovial key id flaunted like a red flag two jades there drag cards blossomed forth into an apotheosis it is the triumphal car of laughter
slaughter that is too cynical to be frank
in truth this laughter is suspicious
this laughter has a mission
it is charged with proving the carnival to the parisians
these fish wife vehicles in which one feels one knows not what shadows set the philosopher to thinking
there is government therein
there one pays one's finger on a mysterious affinity between public men and public women
it certainly is sad that turpitude heaped up should give a sum total of gayety that by piling ignominy upon opprobrium the people should be enticed that the system of spying and serving a scary studs to prostitution should amuse the rabble when it confronts them that the crowd loved to behold that monstrous living pole of tinsel tags half dugg half light roll by on four wheels howling and laughing that they should clap their hands at this glory composed of all shames that there would be no festival for the populace did not the police promenade in their midst these sorts of twenty headed by dr. as of joy
but what can be done about it
the severly boned and be flowers drum bells of more are insulted and pardoned by the laughter of the public
the laughter of all is the accomplice of universal degradation
certain unhealthy festivals disaggregate the people and convert them into the populace
and populace's like tyrants require buffoons
the king has roque laure the populace has the merry andrew
paris is a great mad city on every occasion that it is a great sublime city
there the carnival forms part of politics
paris let us confess it willingly allows infamy to furnish it with comedy
she only demands of her masters when she has master something paint me the mud
rome was of the same mind
she loved nero
nero was a titanic lighter man
chance ordained as we have just said that one of these shapeless clusters of masked men and women dragged about on a vast salas i should hair on the left of the boulevard while the wedding train halted on the fight
the carriage load of masks caught sight of the wedding carriage containing the bridal party opposite them on the other side of the boulevard
hullo
said a masked here's a wedding
a sham wedding retorted another
we are the genuine article
and being too far off road cost the wedding party and fearing also the rebuke of the police the two masks returned their eyes elsewhere
at the end of another minute the carriage load of macker's had their hands full the multitude set to yelling which is the crowd's caress to masquerades and the two hackers who had just spoken had to face the throne with their comrades and did not find the entire repertory of projectiles of the fish markets too extensive to retire to the enormous verbal attacks of the populace
a frightful exchange of metaphors took place between the mask red and the crowd
in the meanwhile two other hackers in the same carriage a spaniard with an enormous nose an elderly air and huge black moustache and again trish wife who was quite a young girl masked with a loup had also noticed the wedding and while their companions and the passersby were exchanging insults they had held a dialogue in a low voice
their aside was covered by the tumult and was lost in it
the gusts of rain had drenched the front of the vehicle which was wide open the breezes of february are not warm as the fish wife clad in a low necked town replied to the spaniards he shivered laughed and coughed
here is their dialogue say now
what daddy
do you see that old code
what old code
yonder in the first wedding carton outside
the one with his arm hung up in a black cravat
yes
well
i'm sure that i know him
ah
i'm willing that they should cut my throat and i'm ready to swear that i never said either you thou orion my life if idon't know that parisian
pantin pic
paris in pant in today
can you see the bride if you stoop down
no
and the bridegroom
there's no bridegroom in that trap
bah
unless it's the old fellow
try to get a sight of the bride by stopping very low
ican't
nevermind that old code who has something the matter with his paw i know and that i'm positive
and what good does it do to know him
no one can tell
sometimes it does
idon't care zhang for old fellows that idon't
i know him
know him if you want to
how the devil does he come to be one of the wedding party
we are in it too
where does that wedding come from
how should i know
listen
well what
there's one thing you ought to do
what's that
get off of our trap and spin that wedding
what for
to find out where it goes and what it is
hurry up and jump down trot my girl your legs are young
lcan't quit the vehicle
why not
i'm tired
at the devil
i owe my fish wife day to the prefecture
that's true
if i leave the cart the first inspector who gets his eye on me will arrest me
you know that well enough
yes i do
i'm bought by the government for today
all the same that old fellow bothers me
do the old fellow's bother you
but you're not a young girl
he's in the first carriage
well
in the bride's trap
what then
so he is the father
what concern is that of mine
i tell you that he's the father
as if he were the only farmer
listen
what
ican't go out otherwise than masked
here i'm concealed no one knows that i'm here
but tomorrow there will be no more hackers
it's ash wednesday
i run the risk of being nabbed
i must sneak back into my hole
but you are free
not particularly
more than i am at any rate
well what if that
you must try to find out where that wedding party went to
where it sent
yes
i know
where is it going then
to the cadran bleu
in the first place it's not in that direction
well
tolar apes
or elsewhere
it's free
wedding parties are at liberty
that's not the point at all
i tell you that you must try to learn for me what that wedding is who that old code belongs to and where that wedding pair lives
i like that
that would be queer
it's so easy to find out a wedding party that passed through the street on a shrove tuesday a week afterwards
spin in what now
ihain't possible
thatdon't matter
you must try
you understand me a selma
the two files resumed their movement on both sides of the boulevard in opposite directions and the carriage of the hackers lost sight of the trap of the bride
chapter ii jean valjean still wears his arm in asking to realize one's dream
to whom is this accorded
there must be elections for this in heaven we are all candidates unknown to ourselves the angels vote
cosette and marius had been elected
cosette both at the mayor's office and at church was dazzling and touching
toussaint assisted by nicole then addressed her
cosette wore over a petticoat of white taffeta here one of bunche gui pure a veil of english points necklace of fine pearls a wreath of orange flowers all this was white and from the midst of that whiteness she beamed forth
it was an exquisite candor expanding and becoming transfigured in the light
one souls have pronounced here virgin on the point of turning into a goddess
marius' handsome hair was lustrous and perfumed here and there beneath the thick curls pale lines the scars of the barricade were visible
the grandfather naughty with head held high amalgamating more than ever in his toilet and his manners all the elegance's of the epoch of barras escorted cosette
he took the place of jean valjean who on account of his arm being still in asking could not give his hand to the bride
jean valjean dressed in black followed them with a smile
monsieur ca uchel event said the grandfather to him this is a fine day
i vote for the end of afflictions and sorrows
henceforth there must be no sadness anywhere
paddle hide free joy
evil has no right to exist
that there should be any unhappy menus in sooth a disgrace to the azure of the sky
evil does not come from man who is good at bottom
all human miseries have for their capital and central government hall otherwise known as the devil's tuileries
good here is muttering demagogic al words
as far as i am concerned i have no longer any politica o opinions let alone be rich that is to say mirthful and i confine myself to that
when at the conclusion of all the ceremonies after having pronounced before the mayor and before the privat all possible jesse's after having signed the registers at the municipality and at the sacristy after having exchanged their rings after having knelt side by side under the pall of white moore in the smoke of the censer they arrived handing and admired and envied by all marius in black she in white preceded by the suisse with the epaulets if a colonel tapping the pavement with his halberd between two rows of astonished spectators at the portals of the church both leaves of which were thrown wide open ready to enter their carriage again abc all being finished cosette still could not believe that it was real
she looked at marius she looked at the crowd she looked at the sky it seemed as though she feared that she should wake up from her dream
her amazed and uneasy air added something indescribably enchanting to her beauty
they entered the same carriage to return home marius besides use them
gillen of mana and jean valjean sat opposite the main evil of norm and has withdrawn one degree and was in the second vehicle
my children's and the grandfather here you are monsieur le baron and madame la baronne with an income of thirty thousand livres
and cosette nestling close to marius caressed his ear with an angelic whisper so it is true
my name is marius
i am madame thou
these two creatures were resplendent
they had reached that irrevocable and irrecoverable moment at the dazzling intersection of all your jane all joy
they realized the verses of jean proud sure they were forty years old taken together
it was marriage sublimated these two children were two lilies
they did not see eachother they did not contemplate each other
cosette perceived marius in the midst of a glory mario's perceived cosette on analyst
and on that altar and in that glory the two apo th roses mingling in the background one knows not how behind a cloud for cosette in a flash for marius there was the ideal thing the real thing the meeting of the kids and the dream the nuptial pillow
all the torments through which they had passed came back to them in intoxication
it seemed to them that their sorrows their sleepless nights their tears their anguish their terrors their despair converted into caresses and rays of light rendered still more charming the charming hour which was approaching and that their briefs were but so many handmaidens who were preparing the toilet of joy
how good it is to have suffered
their unhappiness formed at all round their happiness
the long agony of their love was terminating in an ascension
it was the same enchantment in two souls tinged with voluptuous mess in marius and with modesty in cosette
they said to eachother in low tones we will go back to take a look at our little garden in the rue plumer
the folds of cosette's gown lay across marine
such a day is an ineffable mixture of dream and of reality
one possesses and one supposes
one still has time before one to divine
the emotion on that day of being at midday and of dreaming of midnight is indescribable
the delights of these two hearts overflowed upon the crowd and inspired the passersby with cheerfulness
people halted in the rue saint antoine in front of saint paul to gaze through the windows of the carriage at the orange flowers quivering in cosette's head
then they returned home to the rue des filles ducal faire
marius triumphant and radiant mounted side by side with cosette the staircase up which he had been borne in a dying condition
the poor who had trooper to the door and who shared their purses blessed them
there were flowers everywhere
the house was no less fragrant than the church after the incense roses
they t bought they heard voices ca rolling in the infinite they had god in their hearts destiny appeared to them like a ceiling of stars above their heads they beheld the light of a rising sun
all at once the clock struck
marius glanced at cosette's charming bare arms near the rosy things which were vaguely visible through the pace of her bodice and cosette intercepting marius' glance blushed to her very fair
quite a number of old family friends of the tuple norm and family had been invited they pressed about cosette
each one vied with the rest in saluting her as madame la baronne
the officer theory of bills norm and now a captain had come from chad reed where he was stationed in garrison to be present at the wedding of his cousin pont mercy
cosette did not recognize him
he on his side habituated as he was to have women consider him handsome retained no more recollection of cosette than of any other woman
how right i was not to believe in that story about the lancer
said father ville normand to himself
cosette had never been more tender with jean valjean
she was in unison with father hills norm and while he erected joy into aphorisms and maxims she exhaled goodness like a perfume
happiness desires that all the world should be happy
she regained for the purpose of addressing jean valjean inflections of voice belonging to the time when she was a little girl
she caressed him with her smile
a banquet had been spread in the dining room
illumination as brilliant as the day light is the necessary seasoning of a great joy
mist and obscurity are not accepted by the happy
they do not consent to be black
the night yes the shadows no
if there is now in one must be made
the dining room was full of gay things
in the centre above the white and glittering table was a venetian lustre with flat plates with all sorts of colored birds blue violet red and green perched amid the candles around the chandelier for an roles on the walls sconces with triple and quintuple branches mirrors silverware glassware plate porcelain faience lottery gold and silversmith's work all was sparkling and gay
the empty spaces between the candelabra were filled in with bouquets so that where there was not a light there was a flower
in the antechamber three violins and a flute softly played quartette's by haydn
jean valjean had seated himself on a chair in the drawing room behind the door the leaf of which folded back upon him in such a manner as to nearly conceal him
a few moments before they sat down to table cosette same as though inspired by a sides me him and made him a deep courtesy spreading out her bridal toilet with both hands and with a tenderly roguish glance she asked him father are you satisfied
yes same jean valjean i am content
well then laugh
jean valjean began to laugh
a few moments later basque announced that dinner was served
the guests preceded by m
ville normand with cosette on his arm entered the dining room and arranged themselves in the proper order around the table
two large armchairs figured on the right and left of the bride the first form
ville norm and the other for jean valjean
m
ville norm and took his seat
the other armchair remained empty
they looked about form
gauche le vent
he was no longer there
m
ville norm and questioned basque
do you know where m
f such eleventh s
sir replied basque i do precisely
m
gauche le vent told me to say to you sir that he was suffering his injured hand was pain in g h i'm somewhat and that he could not done with monsieur le baron and madame la baronne
that he begged to be excused that he would come tomorrow
he has just taken his departure
that empty armchair chilled the effusion of the wedding feast for a moment
but if m
faust do event was absent m
ville norm and was present and the grandfather beamed for two
he affirmed that m
gauche le vent had done well to retire early if he were suffering but that it was only a slight ailment
this declaration sufficed
moreover what is an obscure corner in such a submersion of joy
cosette and marius were passing through one of those egotistical and blessed moments when no other faculty is left to a person than that of receiving happiness
and then an idea occurred tom
ville normand
par dieu this armchair is empty
come hither marius
your aunt will permit or although she has a right to you
this armchair is for you
that is legal and delightful
fortuna the beside for fun at a
applause from the whole table
marius took jean valjean's place beside cosette and things fall out so that cosette who had at first been saddened by jean valjean's absence ended by being satisfied with it
from the moment when marius took his place and was the substitute cosette would not have regretted god himself
she set her sweet little golf shoe in white satin on marius' foot
the armchair being occupied m
gauche l event was obliterated and nothing was lacking
and five minutes afterward the whole table from one end to the other was laughing with all the animation of forgetfulness
at dessert m
hills norm and rising to his feet with a glass of champagne in his hand only half full so that the palsy of his eight g years might not cause an overflow proposed the health of the married pair

believe what i say to you
it is good sense
and good sense can not lie
be a religion to each other
each man has his own fashion of adoring god

it is impossible to imagine that god could have made us for anything but this to idolize to coo top teen ourselves to be dove like to be dainty to bill and colour loves from morn tonight to gaze at one's image in one's little wife to be proud to be triumphant to plume oneself that is the aim of life
there let not that displease you which we used to think in our day when we were young folks
ah
vertu bambi che
what charming women there were in those days and what pretty little faces and what lovely passes
i committed my ravages among them
them love each other
if people did not love each other i really do not see what use there would be in having any springtime and for my own part i should pray the good god to shut up all the beautiful things that he shows us and to take away from us and put back in his boat he flowers the birds and the pretty maidens
my children receive an old man's blessing
the evening was gay lively and agreeable
the grandfather's sovereign good humor gave the keynote to the whole feast and each person regulated his conduct on that almost cents marian cordiality
they danced a little they laughed a great deal it was an xml able wedding
goodman days of yore might have been invited to it
however he was present in the person of father ville norman c.
there was a tumult then silence
the married pair disappeared
a little after midnight the hills normand house became a temple
here we pause
on the threshold of wedding nights stands a smiling angel with his finger on his lips
the soul enters into contemplation before that sanctuary where the celebration of love takes place
there should be flashes of light at heart such houses
the joy which they contain ought to make it's escape through the stones of the walls in brilliancy and vaguely illuminate the gloom
it is impossible that this sacred and fatal festival should not give off a celestial radiance to the infinite
love is the sublime crucible wherein the fusion of the man and the woman takes place the being one the being triple the being final the human trinity proceeds from it
this birth of two souls into one ought to be an emotion for the gloom
the lover is the priest the ravished virgin is terrified
something of that you ascends to god
where true marriage is that is to say where there is love the ideal enters in
a nuptial bed makes a book of dawn amid the shadows
if it were given to the eye of the flesh to scan the formidable and charming visions of the upper lobe it is probable that we should be hood the forms of night the winged unknowns the blue passers of the invisible bend down a throng of somber heads around the luminous house satisfied showering benedictions pointing out to eachother the virgin wife gently alarmed sweetly terrified and bearing the reflection of human bliss upon their divine countenances
if at that supreme hour the wed despair dazzled with voli of loudness and believing themselves alone were to listen they would year in their chamber a confused rustling of wings
perfect happiness implies a mutual understanding with the angels
that dark little chamber has all heaven for its ceiling
when two mouths rendered sacred by love approach to create it is impossible that there should not be above that ineffable kiss a quivering throughout the immense mystery of stars
these fell cities are the true ones
there is no joy outside of these joys
love is the only ecstasy
all the rest weeps
to love or to have loved this suffices
demand nothing more
there is no other pearl to be found in the shadowy folds of life
to love is a fulfilment
chapter iii the inseparable what had become of jean valjean
immediately after having laughed at cosette's graceful command when no one was paying any need to him jean valjean had risen and had gained the antechamber unperceived
this was the very room which eight months before he had entered black with mud with blood and powder bringing back the grandson to the grandfather
the old wainscoting was garlanded with foliage and flowers the musicians were seated on the sofa in which they had laid marius down
basque in a black coat knee breeches white stockings and white gloves was arranging rose around all of the dishes that were to be served
jean valjean pointed to his arm in its sling charged basque to explain his and svcd and went away
the long windows of the dining room opened on the street
jean valjean stood for several minutes erect and motionless in the darkness beneath those radiant windows
he listened
the confused sounds of the banquet reached his ear
he heard the loud commanding tones of the grandfather the violins the clatter of the plates the guests of laughter and through all that merry uproar he distinguished cosette's sweet and joyous voice
he quitted the rue des filles ducal faire and returned to the rue del' homme arms
in order to return thither he took the rue saint louis the rue culture sainte catherine and the blanc's mantra is it was a little longer but it was the road through which for the last three months he had become accustomed to pass every day on his way from the rue del' homme arms to the rue des filles ducal faire in order to avoid the obstructions and the mud in the rue girl peru temple
this road through which cosette had passed excluded for him all possibility of any other itinerary
jean valjean entered his lodgings
he lighted his candle and mounted the stairs
the apartment was empty
even toussaint was no longer there
jean valjean's step made more noise than usual in the chambers
all the cupboards stood open
he penetrated to cosette's bedroom
there were no sheets on the bsd
the pillow covered with ticking and without a case of lace was laid on the blankets folded up on the foot of the mattress whose covering was visible and on which no one was ever to sleep again
all the little feminine objects which cosette was attached to had been carried away nothing remained except the heavy furniture and the four walls
toussaint's bed was despoiled in like manner
one bed only was made up and seemed to be waiting someone and this was jean valjean's bed
jean valjean looked at the walls closed some of the cupboard doors and went and came from one room to another
then he sought his own changed once more and set his candle on a table
he had d is engaged his arm from the sling and he used his right hand as though it did not hurt him
he approached his bed and his eyes rested was it by chance
was it intentionally
on the inseparable of which cosette had been jealous on the little portmanteau which never left him
on his arrival in the rue del' homme arms ont meth of june he had deposited it on a round table near the head of his bed
he went to this table with a sort of vivacity took a key from his pocket and opened the values
from it he slowly drew forth the garments in which ten years before cosette had quitted mont vermeil first the little town then the blackfish i then the stout coarse child's shoes which cosette might almost have worn still so tiny were her feet then the gusto and price which was very thick then the knitted petticoat next the apron with pockets then the woollen stockings
these stockings which still preserved the graceful form of a tiny leg were no longer than jean valjean's hand
all this was black of the
it was he who had brought those garments to hong vermeil for her
as he removed them from the valise he laid them on the fed
he fell to thinking
he called up memories
it was in winter in a very cold month of december she was shivering half naked in rats her poor little feet were allred in their wooden shoes
he jean valjean had made her abandon those days to clothe herself in these mourning nabiki ments
the mother must have felt pleased in her grave to see her daughter wearing mourning for her and above all to see that she was properly clothes and that she was warm
he thought of that forest of mont vermeil they had traversed it together cosette and he he thought of what the weather had been of the leafless trees of the wood destitute of birds of the sunless sky it mattered not it was charging
he arranged the tiny garments on the bed the vichy next to the petticoat the st. of kings beside the shoes and he looked at them one after the other
she was no taller than that she had her big doll in her arms she had put her louisd' or in the pocket of that aprons he had laughed they walked handing and she had no one in the world but him
then his venerable white head fell forward on the bed that stoical old heart broke his face was engulfed so to speak in cosette's garments and if anyone had passed up the stairs at that moment he would have heard bright by icons
chapter iv the immortal liver the old and formidable struggle of which we have already witnessed so many phases began once more
jacob struggled with the angel but one night
alas
how many times have we beheld jean valjean seized bodily by his conscience in the darkness and struggling desperately against it
unheard of conflict
at certain moments the boots lips at other moments the ground crumbles away underfoot
how many times had that conscience mad for the gold clasped and overthrown hom
how many times had the truth set her knee inexorably upon his breast
how many times hurled to earth by the light had he begged for mercy
how many times had that implacable spark lighted within him and upon him by the bishop dazzled him by force when he had wished to be blind
how many times badge risen to his feet in the combat held fast to the rock leaning against sophie m dragged on the dust now getting the upper hand of his conscience again overthrown by it
how many times after an equiv o que after the specious and treacherous reasoning of egotism had he heard his irritated conscience cry in his ears trip
you wretch
how many times had his refractory thoughts rattled convulsively in his throat three the evidence of duty
resistance to god
funereal sweats
what secret wounds which he alone felt bleed
state scotia tions in his lamentable existence
how many times he had risen bleeding bruised broken enlightened despair in his heart's desk ity in his soul
and vanquished he had felt himself the conqueror
and after having dislocated broken and rent his conscience with red hot pincers it had said to him as it stood over him formidable luminous and tranquil how to in peace
but on emerging from so melancholy a conflict what a lugubrious peace alas
nevertheless that night jean valjean felt that he was passing through his final combat
a heartrending question presented itself
pre destinations are not all direct they do not open out in a straight avenue before the predestined man they have blind courts impassable aliens obscure turns disturbing crossroads offering the choice of many ways
jean valjean had halted at that moment at the most perilous of these crossroads
he had come to the supreme crossing of good and evil
he had that gloomy intersection beneath his eyes
on this occasion once more as had happened to him already in others as vicissitudes two roads opened out before him the one tempting the other alarming
which was hero take
he was counselled to the one which alarmed him by that mysterious index finger which we all perceive whenever we fix our eyes on the darkness
once more jean valjean had the choice between the terrible port and the smiling ambush
is it then true
the soul may recover but not date
frightful thing
an incurable destiny
this is the problem which presented itself to him in what manner was jean valjean to be made in relation to the happiness of cosette and marius
it was he who has willed that happiness it was he who had brought it about he had himself buried it in his entrails and at that moment when he reflected on it he was able to enjoy the sort of satisfaction which an armored would experience in recognizing his factory mark on a knife on withdrawing it all smoking from his own breast
cosette had marius marius possessed cosette
they had everything even riches
and this was his doing
but what was he jean valjean to do with this happiness now that it existed now that it was there
should be force himself on this happiness
should be treat it as belonging to him
no doubt cosette for belong to another but should be jean valjean retain of cosette all that he could retain
should be remain the sort of father half seen but respected which he had hitherto been
should be without saying a word bring his past to that future
should be present himself there as though he had a right and should be seat himself veiled at that lump mi us fireside
should be fake those innocent hands into his tragic hands with a smile
should be place upon the peaceful fender of the hills norman e. drawing room those feet of his which dragged behind them the disgraceful shadow of the law
should he enter into participation in the fair fortunes of cosette and marius
should be render the obscurity on his brow and the cloud upon the irs still more dense
should be place his catastrophe as a third associate in their felicity
should be continue to hold his peace
in a word should he be the sinister june of destiny beside these two happy beings
we must have become habituated to fatality and to encounters with it in order to have the daring to raise our eyes when certain questions appear to us in all their horrible nakedness
good or evil stands behind this severe interrogation point
what are you going to do
demands the sphinx
this habit of trial jean valjean possessed
he gazed intently at the sphinx
he examined the pitiless problem under all its aspects
cosette that charming existence was the raft of this shipwreck
what was metodo
to cling cash to it or to let go to shops
if he clung to it he should emerge from disaster he should ascend again into the sunlight he should let the bitter water drop from his garments and his hair he was saved he should live
and if he let go his hold
then the abyss
thus he took sad council with his thoughts
or to speak more correctly he fought he kicked furiously internally now against his will now against his conviction
happily for jean valjean that he had been able to weep
that relieved him possibly
but the beginning was savage
a tempest more furious than the one which had formerly driven him to areas broke loose within him
the past curved up before him facing the present he compared them and sobbed
the silence of tears once opened the despairing man writhed
he felt that he had been stopped short
alas
in this fight to the death between our egotism and our duty when we thus retreat step by step before our immutable is fao bewildered furious exasperated at having to yield disputing the ground hoping for a possible flight seeking an escape what an abrupt and sinister resistance does the foot of the wall offer in our rear
to feel the sacred shadow which forms an obstacle
the invisible inexorable what an obsession
then one is never done with conscience
make your choice brutus make your choice cato
it is fathomless since it is now
one flings into that well the labor of one's whole life one flings in one's fortune kneeling simone's riches one flings in one's success one flung simone's liberty or fatherland one flings in one's well being one flings in one's repose one flings in one's joy
more
more
more
empty the case
tip the urn
one must finish by clinging in one's heart
somewhere in the fog of the ancient helps there is at unlike that
is not one pardonable in one at last refused
cam the inexhaustible have any right
are not chains which are endless above human strength
who would blame sisyphus and jean valjean for saying it is enough
the obedience of matter is limited by friction is there no limit to the obedience of the soul
if perpetual motion is impossible can perpetual self sacrifice be exacted
the first step is nothing it is the last which is difficult
what was the champ mathieu affair in comparison with cosette's marriage and of that which it entailed
what is are entrance into the galleys compared to entrance into the void
oh first step that must be descended to a sombre art thou
oh second step how black art thou
how could be refrain from turning aside his head this time
martyrdom is sublimation corrosive sublimation
it is a torture which consecrated
one can consent to it for the first hour one seats oneself on the throne of glowing iron one places on one's head the crown of hot iron one accepts the globe of red hot iron one takes the sceptre of red hot iron but the mantle of flame still remains to be signed and comes there not a moment when the miserable flesh revolts and when one abdicates from suffering
at length jean valjean entered into the peace of exhaustion
he weighed he reflected be considered the alternatives the mysterious balance of light and darkness
should be impose his valleys on those two dazzling children or should be consummate his irremediable engulf ment by himself
on one side lay the sacrifice of cosette on the other that of himself
at what solution should be arrive
what decision did he come to
what resolution did he take
what was his own inward definitive response to the un be unable interrogatory or fatality
what door did he decide to open
which side of his life did he resolve upon closing and condemning
among all the unfathomable precipices which surrounded him which was his choice
what extremity did he accept
to which of the gulf send me now his head
his dizzy're very lasted all night long
he remained there until daylight in the same attitude bent double over that bed prostrate beneath the enormity of fate crushed perchance alas
with clenched fists with arms out spread at right angles like a man crucified who has been in nailed and flung face down on the earth
there he remained for twelve hours the twelve long hours of a long winter's night ice cold without once raising his head and without uttering a word
he was as motionless as a corpse while his thoughts wallowed in the earth and soared now like the hydra now like the eagle
anyone to behold him thus motionless would have pronounced him dead all at once he shuddered convulsively and his mouth glued to cosette's garments kissed them then it could be seen that he was alive
who could see
since jean valjean was alone and there was no one there
the one who is in the shadows
book seventh
the last draught from the cup illustration last drop from the cup blast drop chapter i. the seventh circle and the eighth heaven the days that follow weddings are solitary
people respect the meditations of the happy pair
and also their tardy slumbers to some degree
the tumult of visits and congratulations only begins later on
on the morning of the th of february it was a little past midday when basque with napkin and feather duster under his arm busy in setting his antechamber to rights heard a light tap at the door
there had been boring which was discreet on such a day
basque opened the door and be held m
gauche le vent
he introduced him into the drawing room still encumbered and topsy turvy and which bore the aurora field of battle after the joys of the preceding evening
same sir remarked basque we all woke up late
is your master up
asked jean valjean
how is monsieur's arm
replies basque
better
is your master up
which one
the old one of the new one
monsieur pont mercy
monsieur le baron said basque drawing himself up
a man is a bar on most of all to his servants
he counts for something with them they are what a philosopher would call br spattered with the title and that flatters them
marius be it said in passing a militant republican as he had proved was now sharon in spite of himself
a small revolution had taken place in the family in connection with this title
it was now m
gillen or make who cling to it and marius who detached himself from it
but colonel pont mercy had written my son will be army title
markus obeyed
and then cosette in whom the woman was beginning to dawn was delighted to be a harkness
monsieur le baron
repeated basque
i will go and see
i will tell him that m
gauche p event is here
no
do not tell him that it is i
tell him that someone wishes to speak to him in private and mention no name
ah
ejaculated basque
i wish to surprise him
ah
ejaculated basque once more emitting his second am
as an explanation of the first
and he left the room
jean valjean remained alone
the drawing room as we have just said was in great disorder
it seemed as though by lending an air one might still hear the vague noise of the wedding
on the polished floor lay all sorts of flowers which had fallen from garlands and he addresses
the wax candles burned to stumps added stalactites of wax to the crystal drops of the chandeliers
not a single piece of furniture was in its place
in the corners three or four armchairs drawn close together in a circle had the appearance of continuing a conversation
the whole effect was cheerful
a certain grace still lingers found a dead feast
it has been a happy thing
on the chairs in disarray among those facing flowers beneath those extinct lights people have thought of joy
the sun had succeeded to the chandelier and made its way gayly into the drawing room
several minutes elapsed
jean valjean stood motionless on the spot where basque had left him
he was very pale
his eyes were hollow and so sunken in his head by sleeplessness that they nearly disappeared in their orbits
his black coat bore the weary folds of a garment that has been up all night
the elbows were whitened with the down which the friction of cloth against linen leaves behind it
jean valjean stared at the window outlined in the polished floor at his feet by the sun
there came a sound at the door and he raised his eyes
marius entered his head well up his mouth smiling an indescribable light on his countenance his brow expanded his eyes triumphant
he had not slept either
it is you father
he exclaimed on catching sight of jean valjean that idiot of a basque had such a mysterious air
but you have come too early
it is only half past twelve
cosette is asleep
that word father said tom
gauche le vent by marius signified supreme felicity
there had always existed as the reader knows a lofty walla coldness and a constraint between the mice which must be broken or melted
marius had reached that point of intoxication when the wall was lowered when the ice dissolved and when m
fw uchel event was to him as to cosette a father
he continued his words poured forth as is the peculiarity of divine paroxysms of joy
how glad i am to see you
if you only knew how we missed you yesterday
good morning father
how is your hand
better is it not
and satisfied with the favorable reply which he had made to himself he pursued we have both been talking about you
cosette loves you so dearly
you must not forget that you have a chamber here we want nothing more to do with the rue del' homme arms
we will have no more of it at all
how could you go to live in a street like that which is sickly which is disagreeable which is ugly which has a barrier at one end where one is cold and into which one can not enter
you are to come and install yourself here
and this very day
if you will have to deal with cosette
she means to lead us all by the nose i warn you
you have your own chamber here it is close to ours it opens on the garden the trouble with the clock has been attended to the bed is made it is allready you have only to take possession of it
near your bed cosette has placed a huge old easy chair covered with utrecht velvet and she has said to it' stretch out your arms to him
's nightingale comes to the clump of acacia's opposite your windows every spring
in two months more you will have it
you will have it's nest on your left and ours on your right
by night it will sing and by day cosette will prattle
your chamber faces due south
cosette will arrange your books for you your voyages of captain cook and the other vancouver's and all your affairs
i believe that there is a little valise to which you are attached i have fixed upon a corner of honor for that
you have conquered my grandfather you suit him
we will live together
do you plays host
you will overwhelm my grandfather with delight if you play whose
it is you who shall take cosette to walk on the days when i am at the courts you shall give her your arm you know as you used to in the luxembourg
we are absolutely resolved to be happy
and you shall be included in it in our happiness do you hear father
some will you breakfast with us today
slr said jean valjean i have something to say to you
i am an ex convict
the limit of shrill sounds perceptible can be over leaped as well in the case of the mind as in that of the ear
these words i am a new convict proceeding from the mouth of m
gauche le vent and entering the war of marius overshot the possible
it seemed to him that something had just been said to him but he did not know what
he stood with his mouth wide open
then he perceived that the man who was addressing him was frightful
wholly absorbed in his own dazzled state he had not up to that moment observed the other man's terrible pallor
jean valjean untied the black cravat which supported his right arm unrolled the linen from around his hand bared his thumb and showed it to marius
there is nothing the matter with my hand said he
marine looked at the thumb
there has not been anything the matter with it went on jean valjean
there was in fact no trace of any injury
jean valjean continued it was fitting that i should be absent from your marriage
i absentee myself as much as was in my power
so i invented this injury in order that i might not commit a forgery that i might not introduce a flaw in to the marriage documents in order that i might escape from signing
markus stammered
what is the meaning of this
the meaning of it is replied jean valjean that i have been in the galleys
you are driving me mad
exclaimed marius in terror
monsieur pont mercy said jean valjean i was nineteen years in the galleys
for theft
then i was condemned for life for the ct for a second offence
at the present moment i have broken my bag
in vain did marius recoil before the reality refuse the fact resist the evidence he was forced to give way
he began to understand and as always happens in such cases he understood too much
an inward shudder of hideous enlightenment flashed through him an idea which made him slider traversed his mind
he caught a glimpse of a wretched destiny for himself in the future
say all say all
he cried
you are cosette's father
and he retreated a couple of paces with a movement of indescribable horror
jean valjean elevated his head with so much majesty of attitude that he seemed to grow even to the ceiling
it is necessary that you should believe me here sir although our path to others may not be received in law
here he paused then with a sort of sovereign and sepulchral authority head rev articulating slowly and emphasizing the syllables
you will believe he
i the father of cosette
before god no
monsieur le baron pont mercy i am a peasant of fave rolled
i earned my living by pruning trees
my name is not say che le vent but jean valjean
i am not related to cosette
re assure yourself
marius stammered who will prove that home
i
since i tell you so
marius looked at the man
he was melancholy yet tranquil
no lie could proceed from such a calm
that which is ict is sincere
the truth could be felt in that chill of the tomb
i believe you said marius
jean valjean bent his head as though taking note of this and continued what amigo cosette
a passerby
ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence
i love her it is true
one loves a child whom one has seen when very young being old oneself
when one of old one feels oneself a grandfather towards all little children
you may it seems to me suppose that i have something which resembles a heart
she was an orphan
without either father or mother
she needed me
that is why i began to love her
children are so weak that the first comer even a man like me can become their protector
i have fulfilled this duty towards cosette
i do not think that so slight a thing can be called a good action but if it be a good action well say that i have done it
register this attenuating circumstance
today cosette passes out of my life our two roads part
henceforth i can do not ring for her
she is madame pont mercy
her providence has changed
and cosette gains by the change
all is well
as for the six hundred thousand francs you do not mention them to me but i forest all your thought they are a deposit
how did that deposit come into my hands
what does that matter
i restore the deposit
nothing more can be demanded of me
i complete the restitution by announcing my true name
that concerns me
i have a reason for desiring that you should know who i am
and jean valjean looked marius fill in the face
all that marius experienced was tumultuous and incoherent
certain gusts of destiny produce these billows in our souls
we have all undergone moments of trouble in which everything within us is dispersed we say the first things that occur to us which are not always precisely those which should be said
there are sudden revelations which one can not bear and which intoxicate like baleful wine
marius was stupefied by the novel situation which presented itself to him to the point of addressing that man almost like a person who was angry with him for this avowal
but why he exclaimed do you tell me all this
who forces you to do so
you could have ls lt your secret to yourself
you are neither denounced not tracked for pursued
you have a reason for wantonly making such a revelation
conclude
there is something more
in what connect opn do you make this confession
what is your motive
my motive
replies jean valjean in a voice so low and dull that one would have said that he was talking to himself rather than to marius
from what motive in fact has this convict just said' i am a convict'
well yes
the motive is strange
it is out of honesty
stay the unfortunate point is that i have a thread in my heart which keeps me fast
it is when one is old that that sort of thread is particularly solid
all life falls in ruin around one one resists
hadi been able to tear out that thread to break it to undo the knot or to cut it to go far away i should have been safe
i had only to go away there are diligence's in the rue foul oh you are happy i am going
i have tried to break that thread i have jerked stir it would not break i tore my heart with it
then i said' i can not live anywhere else than here
' i must stay
well yes you are right i am a fool why not simply remain here
you offer me a chamber in this house madame pont mercy is sincerely attached to me she said to the armchair' stretch out your arms to him' your grandfather demands nothing better than to have me i suit him we shall live together and take one meals in common i shall give cosette my arm
madame long mercy excuse me it is a habit we shall have but one roof one table on evite the same chimney corner in winter the same promenade in summer that is not that is happiness that is everything
we shall live as one family
one family
at that word jean valjean became wild
he folded his arms glared at the floor beneath his feet as though he would have excavated an abyss therein and his voice suddenly dose in thundering tones as one family
no
i belong to go family
i do not belong to yours
i do not belong to any family of men
in houses where people are among themselves i am superfluous
there are families but there is nothing of the sort forms
i am an unlucky wretch i am left outside
did i have a father and mother
i almost doubt it
on the day when i have that child in marriage all came to amend
i have seen her happy and that she is with a man whom she loves and that there exists here a kind old man a household of two angels and all joys in that house and that it was well i said to myself' enter thou not
' i could have lied it is true have deceived you all and remained monsieur gauche legend
so long as it was corner i could lie but now it would be for myself and i must not
it was sufficient for me to hold my peace it is true and all would go on
you ask me what has forced me to speak
a very odd thing my conscience
to hold my peace was very easy however
i passed the night in trying to persuade myself foot you questioned me and what i have just said to you is so extraordinary that you have the right to do it well yes i have passed the night in alleging reasons to myself and i gave myself very good reasons i have done what i could
but there are two things in which i have not succeeded in breaking the thread that holds me fixed riveted and sealed hereby the heart or in silencing someone who speak swiftly to me when i am alone
that is why i have come hither to tell you everything this morning
everything or nearly everything
it is useless to tell you that which concerns only myself i keep that to myself
you know the essential points
so i have taken my mystery and have brought it to you
and i have risen bowel led my secret before your eyes
it was not a resolution that was easy to take
i struggled all night long
ah
you think that i did not tell myself that this was no champ mathieu affair that by concealing my name i was doing no one any injury that the name of faux tel event had been given to me by gauche le vent himself out of gratitude for a service rendered to him and that i might assuredly keep it and that i should be happy in that chamber which you offer me that i should not be in any one's way that i should be in my own little corner and that while you would have cosette i should have the idea that i was in the same house with her
each one of us would have had his share of happiness
if i continued to be mobzy eur faux held deny that would arrange everything
yes with the exception of my soul
there was not everywhere upon my surface but the bottom of my soul remained black
it is not enough to be happy one must be content
thus i should have remained monsieur rauch do event thus i should have concealed my true visage thus in the presence of your expansion i should have had an enigma thus in the midst of your full moon day i should have had shadows this without crying'' wars' i should have simply introduced the galleys to your fireside i should have taken my seat at your table with the thought that if you knew who is as you would drive me bei mir i should have allowed myself to be served by domestic's who had then known would have said' how horrible
' i should have touched you with my elbow which you have a right to dislike i should have fulcher your clasps of the hand
there would have existed in your house a division of respect between vegetable white locks and tainted white locks at your most intimate hours when all hearts thought themselves open to the very bottom to all the test when we four were together your grandfather you two and myself a stranger would have been present
i should have been side by side with you in your existence having for my only care not to die arrange the cover of my dreadful pot
this is dead man should have thrust myself upon you who are living beings
i should have condemns cnet to myself forever
tom and cosette and i would have had all three of our heads in the green cap
does it not make you shudder
i am only the most brushed of men i should have been the most monstrous of men
and i should have committed that crime every day
and i should have had that face of night upon my visage every day
every day
and i should have communicated to you a share in my taint every day
every day
to you my dearly beloved my children to young innocent creatures
i sit nothing to hold one's peace
is it a simple matter to keep silence
no it is not simple
there is a silence which lies
and kylie and my fraud and my indignity and my cowardice and my treason and my crime i should have drained drop by drop i should have spit it out then swallowed it again i should have finished at midnight and have begun again at midday and my' good morning' would have lied and my' good night' would have lied and i should have slept on it i should have eaten it with my bread and i should have looked cosette in the face and i should have responded to the smile of the angel by the smile of the damned soul and i should have been an abominable villain
why should i do it
in order to be happy
in order to be happy
hebei the right to be happy
i stand outside of life air
jean valjean paused
marius listened
such chains of ideas and of anguished can not be interrupted
jean valjean lowered his voice once more but it was no longer a full voice it was a sinister voice
you ask why i speak
i am neither denounced not pursued not tracked you say
yes
i am denounced
yes
i am tracker
by whom
by myself
it is i who had the passage to myself and i drag myself and i push myself and largest myself and i execute myself and when one holds oneself one is firmly held
and seizing a handful of his own cost by the nape of the neck and extending it towards marius do you see that fish
he continued
don't you think that it holds that collar in such a wise as not to release it
well
conscience is another grasp
if one desires to be happy sir one must never understand duty for as soon as one has comprehend edit it is implacable
one would say that it punished you for comprehending it but no it rewards you for it places you in a hell where you feel box beside you
one has no sooner lacerated his own entrails than he is at peace with himself
and with a poignant accent he added monsieur pont mercy this is not common sense i am an honest man
it is by degrading myself in your eyes that i elevate myself in my own
this has happened to me once before but it was less painful then it was a mere nothing
yes an honest man
i should not be sold through my fault you had continued to esteem me now that you despise me i am so
i have that fatality hanging over me that not being able to ever have anything but stolen consideration that consideration humiliates me and crushes me inwardly and in order that i may respect myself it is necessary that is to uld be despised
then i straighten up again
i am a galley slaves to obeys his conscience
i know well that that is most improbable
but what would you have me do about it
it is the fact
i have entered into engagements with myself i keep them
there are encounters which bind us there are chances which involve us in duties
you see monsieur pont mercy various things have happened to me in the course of my life
again jean valjean paused swallowing his saliva with an effort as though his words has a bitter aftertaste and then he went on when one has such a horror hanging over one one has not the right to make others share it without their knowledge one has not the right to make them slip over one's own precipice without their perceiving it one has not the right to let p he's red blouse drag upon them one has no right to slyly encumber with one's misery the happiness of others
it is hideous to approach those who are healthy and to touch them in the dark with one's ulcer
in spite of the fact that gauche le vent lent me his name i have no right to use it he could give it home but i could not take it
q name is an i
you see did that i have thought somewhat i have read a little although i am a peasant and you see that i express myself properly
i understand things
i have procured myself an education
well yes to abstracts name and to place oneself under it is dishonest
letters of the alphabet can be tips he'd like a purse or a watch
to be a false signature in flesh and blood to be a living false key to enter the house of honest people by picking their lock never move to look straight forward to forever eye askance to be infamous within the ink
no
no
no
no
it is better to suffer to bleed to weep to hear one's skin from the flesh with one's nails to pass rights writhing in anguish to devour oneself body and soul
that is why i have just told you all this
want only as you say
he drew a painful breath and hurled this final word in days gone by i stole a loaf of bread in order to live today in order to live i will not steal a name
to live
interrupted marius
you do not need that name in order to live
ah
i understand the matter said jean valjean raising and lowering his head several times in succession
a silence ensued
both held their peace each plunged in a gulf of thoughts
marius was sitting near a table and testing the corner of his mouth on one of his fingers which was folded back
jean valjean was pacing to and fro
he paused before a mirror and remained motionless
then as though replying to some inward course of reasoning he said as he gazed at the mirror which he did not dec while at present i am relieved
he took up his march again and walked to the other end of the drawing room
at the moment when he turned round he perceived that marius was watching his walk
then he said with an inexpressible intonation i drag my legs little
now you understand why
then he turned fully round towards marius and now sir imagine this i have said nothing i have remained monsieur ranch eleven to have taken my place in your house jan one of you i am in my chamber i come to breakfast in the morning in slippers in the evening all three of us go to the play i accompany madame pont mercy to the tuileries and to the place royale we are together you think me your equal one fine day you are there and i am there we are conversing we are laughing all at once you hear's voice shouting this name' jean valjean
' and behold that terrible hand the police darts from the darkness and abruptly tears off my mask
again he paused marius had sprung to his feet with a shudder
jean valjean resumed what do you say to that
marius' silence answered for him
jean valjean continued you see that i am right in not holding my peace
be happy be in heaven be the angel of an angel exist in the sun be content therewith and do not trouble yourself about the means which a poor damned wretch takes to open his breast and force his duty to come forth you have before you sir a wretched man
marius slowly crossed the room and when he was quite close to jean valjean he offered the latter his hand
but marius was obliged to step up and take that name which was not offered jean valjean let him have his own way and it seemed to marius that he pressed a hand of marble
my grandfather had friends said markus i will procure your pardon
it is useless replied jean valjean
i am believed to be dead and that suffices
the dead are not subjected to surveillance
they are supposed to rot in peace
death is the same thing as pardon
and disengaging the hand which marius held he added with a sort of inexorable dignity moreover the friend to whom i have recourse is the sling of my duty and i need but one pardon that of my conscience
at that moment adopt at the other end of the dead in groom opener gently halfway and in the opening cosette's head appeared
they saw only her sweet face her hair was in charming disorder her eyelids were still swollen with sleep
she made the movement of a bird which thrusts its head out of its best glanced first at her husband then at jean valjean and cried to them with a smile so that they seemed to behold a smile at the heart of arose i will wager that you are talking politics
how stupid that is instead of being with me
jean valjean shuddered
cosette
stammered marius
and he paused
one would have said that they were two criminals
cosette who was radiant continued to gaze at both of them
there was something in her eyes like gleams of paradise
i have caught you in the very act said cosette
just how i heard my father gauche le vent through the door saying' conscience
doing my duty
' that is politics indeed it is
i will not have it
people should not talk politics the very next day
it is not eight
you are mistaken
cosette said marius we are talking business
we are discussing the best investment of your six hundred trims and france
that is not it at all interrupted cosette
i am coming
does anybody want me here
and passing resolutely through the door she entered the drawing room
she was dressed in a voluminous white dressing gown with a thousand folds and large sleeves which starting from the neck fell to her feet
in the golden heavens of some ancient gothic pictures there are these charming sacks fit to clothe the angels
she contemplated herself from head to foot in a long mirror then exclaimed in an outburst of ineffable ecstasy there was once a king and a queen
oh
how happy i am
that said she made a curtsey to marius and to jean valjean
there said she i am going to install itself near you in an easy chair we breakfast in half an hour you shall say anything you like i know well that men just talk and i will be very good
marius took her by the arm and said lovingly to her we are talking business
by the way said cosette i have opened my windows flock of pierrot's has arrived in the garden birds not hackers
today is ash wednesday but not for the birds
i tell you that we are talking business to my little cosette leave us alone for a moment
we are talking figures
that will bore you
you have a charming cravat on this morning markus
you are very can wicked monseigneur
no it will not bore me
i assure you that it will bore you
go
since it is you
i shall not understand you but i shall listen to you
when one hears the voices of those whom one loved one does not need to understand the words that the gutter
that we should be here together that is all that i desire
i shall remain with you bay
you are my beloved cosette
impossible
impossible
yes
very good said cosette
i was going to tell you some news
i could have told you that your grandfather is still asleep that your aunt is at mass that the chimney in my father gauche p event's room smokes that nicolette has sent for the chimney sweep that toussaint and nicolette have already quarrelled that nicolette makes sport of toussaint's stammer
well you shall know nothing
ah
it is impossible
you shall see gentlemen that i in my turn can say it is impossible
then who will be caught
i beseech you my little marius let me stay here with you two
i swear to you that it is indispensable that we should be alone
well am i anybody
jean valjean had not uttered a single word
cosette turned to him in the first place father i want you to come and embrace me
what do you mean by not saying anything instead of taking my part
who gave me such a father as that
you must perceive that my family life is very unhappy
my husband beats me
come embrace me instantly
jean valjean approached
cosette turned toward marius
as for you i shall make a face at you
then she presented her brow to jean valjean
jean valjean advanced w step toward her
cosette recoiled
father you are pale
does your arm hurt you
it is well said jean valjean
did you sleep badly
no
are you sad
no
embrace me if you are well if you sleep well if you are content i will not scold you
and again she offered him her brow
jean valjean dropped a kiss upon that grow where one dated a celestial gleam
smile
jean valjean obeyed
it was the smile of a spectre
now defend me against my husband
cosette
ejaculated marius
get angry father
say that i must stay
you can certainly talk before me
so you think ms very silly
what you say is astonishing
business placing money in a bank a great matter truly
men make mysteries out of nothing
i am very pretty this morning
looms the marius
and with an adorable shrug of the shoulders and an indescribably exquisite pour she glanced at marius
i love you
said marius
i adore you
said cosette
and they fell irresistibly into each other's arms
now said cosette adjusting a role of her dressing gown with a triumphant little grimace i shall stay
no not that said markus in a suppl is a ringtone
we have to finish something
still no
marius assumed a grave done i assure you cosette that it is impossible
ah
you put on your man's voices of
that is well i go
you rather have not upheld me
monsieur my father monsieur my husband you are tyrants
i shall go and tell grandpa pa
if you think that i am going to return and talk platitudes to you you are mistaken
i am proud
i shall wait for you now
you shall see that it is you who are going to be bored without me
i am going it is well
and she left the room
two seconds later the door opened once more her fresh and rosy head was again thrust between the two leaves and she cried to them i am very angry indeed
the door closed again and the shadows descended once more
it was as though a day of sunlight should have suddenly traversed the night without itself being conscious of it
marius made sure that the door was securely closed
poor cosette
he murmured when she finds out
at that dped jean valjean trembled in every limb
he fixed on marius a bewildered eye
cosette
oh yes it is true you are going to tell cosette about this
that is right
's day i had not thought of that
one has the strength for one thing but not for another
sir i conjure you i entreat now air give me your most sacred word of honor that you will not tell her
is it not enough that you should know it
i have been able to say it myself without being forced to it i could have told it to the universe to the whole world it was all one time
but she she does not know what it is it would terrify her
what a convict
we should be obliged to explain matted stoner to say to her' he is a man who has been in the galleys
' she saw the chain gang pass by one day
oh
my god
he dropped into an armchair and hid his face in his hands
his grief was not audible but from the quivering of his shoulders it was evident that he was weeping
silent tears terrible tests
there is something of suffocation in the son
he was seized with a sort of convulsion he threw himself against the back of the chair as though to gain breath letting his arms fall and allowing marius to see his face inundated with tears and marius heard him murmur solos that his voice seemed to issue from fathomless depths oh
would that i could die
beat your ease said marius i will keep your secret for myself alone
and less touched perhaps than he ought to have been but forces for the last hour to familiarize himself with something as unexpected as it was dreadful gradually be holding the convict superposed before his very eyes upon m
gauche le vent overcome little by little by that lugubrious reality and led by the natural inclination of the situation to recognize the space which had just been placed between that man and himself marius added it is impossible that i should not speak a word to you with regard to the deposit which you have so faithfully and honestly remitted
that is an act of probity
it is just that some recompense should be bestowed on you
fix the sum yourself it shall be counted out to you
do not fear to set it very high
i thank you sir replied jean valjean gently
he remained in thought for a moment mechanically passing the top of his forefinger across his thumbnail then he lifted up his voice all is nearly over
but one last thing remains for me
what is it
jean valjean struggled with what seemed a last hesitation and without voice without breath he stammered rather than said now that you know do you think sir you who are the master that i ought not to see cosette any more
i think that would be better replied marius coldly
i shall never seemed more murmured jean valjean
and he directed his steps towards the door
he laid his hand on the mhob the latch yielded the door opened
jean valjean pushed it open far enough to pass through stood motionless for a second then closed the door again and turned to marius
he was no longer pale he was livid
there were no longer any tears in his eyes but only a sort of tragic flame
his voice had regained a strange composure
stats if he said
if you will allow it i will come to see her
i assure you that i desire it greatly
if i had not cared to see cosette i should not have made to you the confession that i have made i should have gone away but as i decided to remain in the place where cosette is and to continue to see her i had to tell you about it honestly
you follow my reasoning do you not
it is a matter easily understood
you see i have had her with me for more than nine years
we lived first in that hit on the boulevard then in the convent then near the luxembourg
that was where you saw her for the first time
you remember her blue plus that
then we went to the quartier des invalides where there was a falling on a garden the rue plumer
i lived in a little back courtyard whence i could heather piano
that was my life
we never left each other
that lasted for nine years and some months
i was like her own father and she was my child
i do not know whether you understand monsieur pont mercy but to go away now never to see her again never to speak to her again to no longer have anything would be hard
if you do not disapprove of it i will come to see cosette from time to time
i will not come often
i will not remain long
you shall give orders that i am to be received in the little waiting room
on the ground floor
i could enter perfectly well by the backdoor but that might create surprise perhaps and it would be better i think for me to enter by the usual door
truly did i should like to see a little more of cosette
as rarely as you please
put yourself in my place i have nothing left but that
and then we must be cautious
if i no longer come at all it would produce a bad effect it would be considered singular
what i can do by the way is to come in the afternoon when night is beginning to fall
you shall come every evening said marius and cosette will be waiting for you
you are kinds of said jean valjean
marius saluted jean val jean happiness escorted despair to the door and these two men parts d
chapter ii the obscurities which a revelation can contain marius was quite upset
the sort of estrangement which he had always felt towards the man beside whom he had seen cosette was now explained to him
there was something enigmatic about that person of which his instinct has warned him
this enigma was the most hideous of disgraced the galleys
this m.
gauche l event was the convict jean valjean
to abruptly find such a secret in the midst of one's happiness resembles the discovery of a scorpion in a nest of turtle doves
was the happiness of marius and cosette thenceforth condemned to such a neighborhood
was this an accomplished fact
did the acceptance of that man forms part of the marriage now consummated
was there nothing to be done
had marius wedded the convict as well
in vain may one be crowned with light and joy in vain may one taste the grand purple tour of live happy love such stocks would force even the archangel in his ecstasy even the demigod in his glory to shudder
as is always the case unchanged or view of this nature marius asked himself whether he had nothing with which to reproach himself
had he been wanting in divination
had he been wanting in prudence
had he involuntarily filled his wits
a little perhaps
had he entered upon this love affair which has ended in his marriage to cosette without taking sufficient precautions to throw light upon the surroundings
he admitted it is thus by a series of successive admissions of ourselves in regard to ourselves that life amends is little by little he admitted the chimerical and visionary side of his nature a sort of internal cloud peculiar to many organizations and which in paroxysms of passion and sorrow dilates as the temperature of the soul changes and invades the entire man to such a degree as to render him nothing more than a conscience bathed in a mist
we have more than once indicated this characteristic element of marius' individuality
he recalled that in the intoxication of his love in the rue plumer during those six or dr. ben ecstatic week she had not even spoke to cosette of that drama in the hot beau novel where the victim had taken up such a singular line of silence during the struggle and the ensuing flight
how had it happened that he had not mentioned this to cosette
get it was so near and so terrible
how had it come to pass that he had not even named the the barriers and particularly on the day when he had encountered epo none
he now found it almost difficult to explain his silence of that time
nevertheless he could account for it
he recalled his bs number state his intoxication with cosette love absorbing everything that catching a way of each other into the ideal and perhaps also like the imperceptible quantity of reason mingled with this violent and charming state of the soul a vague full instinct impelling him to conceal and abolish in his memory that redoubtable adventure contact with which he dreaded in which he did not wish to play any party is agency in which he had kept secret and in which he could be neither narrator not witness without being an accused
moreover these few weeks had been a flash of lightning there has been no time for anything except love
in short having weighed everything turned everything over in his mind examined everything whatever might have been the consequences if he had told cosette about the forbes jam bush even if he had discovered that jean valjean was a convict would that have changed him marius
would that have changed her cosette
would he have drawn back
would behave adored her any theless
would he have refrained from marrying her
no
then there was nothing to regret nothing with which he need reproach himself
all was well
there is a deity for those drunken men who are called lovers
marius blind had followed the path which he would have chosen had he been in full possession of his right
love had bandaged his eyes in order to lead him whither
to paradise
but this paradise was henceforth complicated with an internal accompaniment
marius' ancient estrangement towards this man towards this gauche le vent who had turned into jean valjean was at present mingled with horror
in this horror of the state there was some pity and even a certain surprise
this thief this thief guilty of a second offence had restored that deposit
and what a deposit
six hundred thousand francs
he alone was in the secret of that deposit
he might have kept it all he had restored it all
moreover he had himself revealed his situation
nothing forced him to this
if anyone learned who he was it was through himself
in this avowal there was something more than acceptance of humiliation there was acceptance of peril
for a condemned man x mask is not a mask it is a smelter
a false name is security and he had rejected that false name
he the valley slave might have hidden himself forever in an honest family he has withstood this temptation
and with what motive
through a conscientious scruple
he himself explained this with the irresistible accents of truth
in short whatever this jean valjean might be he was undoubtedly a conscience which was awakening
there existed some mysterious rehabilitation which had begun and to all appearances scruples had for a long time already controlled this man
such fits of justice and goodness are not characteristic of vulgar natures
an awakening of conscience is grandeur of soul
jean valjean was sincere
this sincerity visible palpable it defrag able evident from the very brief that it caused him rendered inquiries useless and conferred authority on all that that man had said
here for marius there was a strange reversal of situations
what breathed from m
gauche le vent
district
what did jean valjean inspire
confidence
in the mysterious balance of this jean valjean which the pensive marius struck he admitted the active principle he admitted the passive principle and he tried to reach a balance
but all this went on as in a storm
marius while endeavoring to form a clear idea of this man and while pursuing jean valjean so to speak in the depths of his thought lost him and found him again in a fatal mist
the deposit honestly restored the probity of the confession these were good
this produced a lightening of the cloud then the cloud became black once more
troubled as we're marius' memories a shadow of them returned to him
after all what was that adventure in the jon dee the attic
why had that man taken to flight on the arrival of the police instead of entering a complaint
here marius found the answer
because that man was a fugitive from justice who had broken his bag
another question why had that man come to the barricade
for marius now once more distinctly be held that recollection which has reappeared in his emotions like sympathetic ink at the application of heat
this man had been in the barricade
he had not fought there
what had become there for
in the presence of this question aspect re sprang up and replied javert
marius recalled perfectly now that funereal sight of jean valjean dragging the pink ones javert out of the barricade and he still heard behind the corner of the little them on detour that frightful pistol shot
obviously there was hatred between that police spy and the valley slave
the one was in the other's day
jean valjean had gone to the barricade for the purpose of recent ing himself
he had arrived late
he probably knew that is very was a prisoner there
the corsican vendetta has penetrated to certain lower strata and has become the law there it is so simple that it does not astonish souls which are but half turned towards good and those hearts are so constituted that a criminal who is in the path of repentance may be scrupulous in the matter of theft and unscrupulous in the matter of vengeance
jean valjean had killed javert
at least that seemed to be evident
this was the final question to be sure but do this there was to reply
this question marius felt like pincers
now had it come to pass that jean valjean's existence had elbowed that of cosette for skiing a period
what melancholy sport of providence was that which had placed that child in contact with that man
are there then chains for two which are forged on high
and does god take pleasure in coupling the angel with the demon
so a crime and an innocence can be roommates in the mysterious valleys of wretchedness
in that we filing of condemned persons which is called human destiny can be of rows pass side by side the one ingenuous the other formidable the one all bathed in the divine whiteness of dawn the other forever blemished by the flash of an eternal lightning
who could have arranged that inexplicable pairing off
in what manner in consequence of what prodigy had any community of life been established between this celestial little creature and that old criminal
who could have found the lamb to the wolf and what was still more in comprehensible have attached the wolf to the lamb
for the wolf loved the lamb for the fierce creatures voted the feeble one for during the space of nine years the angel had had the monster as her point of support
cosette's childhood and girlhood her accent in the daylight her virginal growth towards life and light had been sheltered by that hideous devotion
here questions exfoliated so to speak into innumerable enigmas abysses yawned at the bottoms of abysses and marius could no longer bend over jean valjean without becoming dizzy
what was this man precipice
the old symbols of genesis are eternal in human society such as it now exists and until a broader days hall effect a change in it there will always be two men the one superior the other subterranean the one which is according to good isabel the other which is according to evil is cain
what was this tender cain
what was this ruffian religiously absorbed in the adoration of a virgin watching over her reading her guarding her signifying her and enveloping her impure as he was himself with purity
what was that cesspool which has generated that innocence to such a point as not to leave upon it a single spot
what was this jean valjean educating cosette
what was this figure of the shadows which had for its only object the preservation of the rising of a star from every shadow and from every cloud
that was jean valjean's secret that was also god's secret
in the presence of this double secret marius recoiled
the one in some sort reassured him as to the other
god was as visible in this affair as was jean valjean
god has his instruments
he makes use of the tool which he will c
he is not responsible to men
do we know how box sets about the work
jean valjean had labored over cosette
he had to some extent made that soul
that was incontestable
well what then
the workman was horrible but the work was admirable
god produces his miracles as seems good to him
he has constructed that charming cosette and he had employed jean valjean
it had pleased him to choose this strange collaborator for himself
what account have we to demand of him
is this the first time that the dung heap has aided the spring to create the rose
marius made himself these replies and declared to himself that they were good
he had not dared to press jean valjean on all the points which we have just indicated but he did not confess to himself that he did not dare to do it
he adored cosette he losses sec cosette cosette was splendidly pure
that was sufficient for him
what enlightenment did he news
cosette was a light
does light require enlightenment
he had everything what more could be desire
all is not that enough
jean valjean's personal affairs did not concern him
and bending over the fatal shadow of that man he clung fast convulsively to the solemn declaration of that unhappy wretch i am nothing to cosette
ten years ago i did not know that she was in existence
jean valjean was a passerby
he had said so himself
well he had passed
whatever he was his part was finished
henceforth there remained marius to fulfil the part of providence to cosette
cosette had sought the azure in a person like herself in her loved her husband her celestial male
cosette as she took her flight winged and transfigured left behind her on the earth her hideous and empty chrysalis jean valjean
in whatever circle of ideas marius revolved he always returned to a certain horror for jean valjean
a sacred horror perhaps for as we have just pointed out he felt a quite if i gum in that man
but do what he would and seek what exten uation he would he was certainly forced to fall back up on this the man was a convict that is to data being who has not even a place in the social ladder since he is lower than the very lowest rung
after the very last of men comes the convict
the convict is no longer so to speak in the semblance of the living
the law has deprived him of the entire quantity of humanity of which it can deprive a man
marius on legal questions still held to the inexorable system though he was a democrat and he entertained all the ideas of the law on the subject of those whom the law strikes
he had not yet accomplished all progress we admit
he had not yet come to distinguish between that which is written by man and that which is written by god between law and right
he had not examined and weighed the right which man takes to dispose of the irrevocable and the irreparable
he was not shocked by the word find iste
he found it quite simple that certain breaches of the written law should be followed by eternal dufferin hand he accepted as the process of civilization social damnation
he still stood at this point though safe to advance infallibly later on since his nature was good and at bottom wholly formed of latent progress
in this stage of his ideas jean valjean appeared to him hideous and repulsive
he was a man reproved he was the convict
that word was for him like the sound of the trump in the day of judgment and after having reflected upon jean valjean for a long time his final gesture had been to turn away his head
case retro
marius if we must recognize and even insist upon the fact while interrogating jean valjean to such a point that jean valjean had said you are confessing he had not nevertheless put to him two or three decisive questions
it was not that they had not presented themselves to his mind but that he had been afraid of them
the montre the attic
the barricade
javert
who knows where these revelations would have stopped
jean valjean did not seem like a man who would draw back and who knows whether marius after having urged him on would not have himself desired to hold him back
has it not happened to all of us in certain supreme conjuncture's to stop our ears in order that we may not hear the reply after we have asked a question
it is especially when one loves that one gives way to these exhibitions of cowardice
it is not wise to question sinister situations to the last point particularly when the indissoluble side of our life is fatally intermingled with them
what a terrible light might have proceeded from the despairing explanations of jean valjean and who knows whether that hideous flare would not have darted forth as far as cosette
who knows whether a sort of internal flow would not have lingered behind it on the brow of that angel
the spattering of a lightning flash is of the thunder also
fatality has points of juncture where innocence itself is stamped with crime by the gloomy law of the reflections which give color
the purest figures may forever preserve the reflection of a horrible association
rightly or wrongly marius had been afraid
he already knew too much
he sought to full his senses rather than to gain further light
in dismay before off cosette in his arms and shut his eyes to jean valjean
that man was the night the living and horrible night
how should be dare to seek the bottom of it
it is a terrible thing to interrogate the shadow
who knows what it's reply will be
the dawn may be blackened forever by it
in this state of mind the thought that that man would henceforth come into any contact whatever with cosette was a heartrending perplexity to marius
he now almost reproached him selfe or not having put those formidable questions before which he had refilled and from which an implacable and definitive decision might have sprung
he felt that he was too good too gentle too weak if we must say the word
this weakness had left into an imprudent concession
he had allowed himself to be touched
he had been in the wrong
he ought to have simply and purely rejected jean valjean
jean valjean played the part of fire and that is what he should have done and have freed his house from that man
he was vexed with himself he was angry with that whirlwind of emotions which had deafened blinded and carried him away
he was displeased with himself
what waste to do now
jean valjean's visits were profoundly repugnant to him
what was the use of having that man in his house
what did the man want
here he became dismayed he did not wish to dig down he did not wish to penetrate deeply he did not wish to sound himself
he had promised he had allowed himself to be drawn into a promise jean valjean held his promise one must keep one's word event is convict above all to a convict
still his first duty was to cosette
in short he was carried away by the repugnance which dominated him
marius turned over all this confusion of ideas in his mind passing from one to the other and moved by all of them
hence arose a profound trouble
it was not easy for him to hide this trouble from cosette but love is a talent and marius succeed exim doing it
however without any apparent object he questioned cosette who was as candi dasa code is white and who suspected nothing he talked of her childhood and her youth and he became more and more convinced that that convict had been everything good paternal and respectable that a man can be towards cosette
all that marius had caught a glimpse of and had surmised was real
that sinister nettle had loved and protected that lily
book eighth
fading away of the twilight i'll istration the twilight decline h decline chapter i. the lower chamber on the following day at nightfall jean valjean knocked at the carriage rate of the hills normand house
it was basque who received him
basque was in the courtyard at the appointed hour as though he had received his orders
it sometimes happens that one says to a servant you will watch for mg
so and so when he arrives
basque addressed jean valjean without waiting for the latter to approach him monsieur le baron has charged me to inquire whether monsieur desires to go upstairs or to remain below
i will remain below replied jean valjean
basque who was perfectly respectful opened the door of the waiting room and said i will go and inform madame
the room which jean valjean entered was a damp vaulted room on the ground floor which served as a cellar on occasion which opened on the street was paved with red squares and was badly lighted by a grated window
this chamber was not one of those which are harassed by the feather duster the pope's head brush and the broom
the dust rested tranquilly there
persecution of the spiders was not organized there
a fine web which spread far and wide and was very black and ornamented with dead flies formed a wheel on one of the window panes
the room which was small and low veiled was furnished with a heap of empty bottles piled up in one corner
the wall which was daybed with an ochre yellow wash was scaling off in larger lakes
at one end there was a chimney piece painted in black with a narrow shelf
a fire was burning there which indicated that jean valjean's reply i will remain below had been foreseen
two arm chairs were placed at the two corners of the fireplace
between the chairs an old bedside rug which displayed more foundation thread than wool had been spread by way of a carpet
the chamber was lighted by the fire on the hearth and the twilight falling through the window
jean valjean was fatigued
for says he had neither eaten not slept
he threw himself into one of the arm chairs
basque returned sets lighted candle on the chimney piece and retired
jean valjean his head drooping and his chin resting on his breast perceived neither basque nor the candle
all at once he drew himself up with a start
cosette was standing beside him
he had not seen her enter but he had felt that she was there
he turned round
he gazed at her
she was adorably lovely
but what he was contemplating with that profound gaze was not her beauty but her soul
well exclaimed cosette rather i knew that you were peculiar but i never should have expected this
what an idea
marius told me that you wish me to receive you here
yes it is my wish
i expected that reply
food
i warn you that i am going to make a scene for you
let us begin at the beginning
embrace me father
and she offered him her cheek
jean valjean remained motionless
you do not stir
i take note of it
attitude of guilt
but never mind i pardon you
jesus christ said offer the other cheek
here it is
and she presented her other cheek
jean valjean did not move
it seemed as though his feet were mailed to the pavement
this is becoming serious said cosette
what have i done to you
i declare that i am perplexed
you owe me reparation
you will dine with us
i have dined
that is not true
i will get m
ville normand to scold you
grandfathers are made to reprimand fathers
come
go upstairs with me to the drawing room
immediately
impossible
here cosette lost ground a little
she ceased to command and passed to questioning
but why
and you choose the ugliest chamber in the house in which to see me
it's horrible here
thou knowest
jean valjean caught himself up
you know madame that i am peculiar i have my freaks
cosette struck her tiny hands together
madame
you know
more novelties
what is the meaning of this
jean valjean directed upon her that heartrending smile to which he occasionally had recourse you wished to be madame
you are so
not for you father
do not call me father
what
call me' monsieur jean
'' mean' if you like
you are no longer my father
i am no longer cosette
' monsieur jean'
what does this mean
why these are revolutiondaren't they
what has taken place
come look me in the face
and youwon't live with us
and youwon't have my chamber
what have i done to you
has anything happened
nothing
well then
everything is as usual
why do you change your name
you have changed yours surely
he smiled again with the same smile as before and added since you are madame pont mercy i certainly can be monsieur jean
idon't understand anything about it
all this is idiotic
i shall ask permission of my husband for you to be' monsieur jean
' i hope that he will not consent to it
you cause me a great deal of pain
one does have freaks bug one does not cause one's little cosette grief
that is wrong
you have no right to be wicked you who are so good
he made no reply
she seized his hands with vivacity and raising them to her face with an irresistible movement she pressed them against her neck beneath her chin which is a gesture of profound tenderness
on
she said to him be good
and she went on this is what i call being good being nice and coming and living here there are bird whereas there are in the rue plumer living with us quitting that hole of a rue del' homme arms not giving us riddles to guess being like all the rest of the world dining with us breakfast inn with us being my father
hello see her hands
you no longer need a father you have a husband
cosette became angry
i no longer need a father
one really does not know what to say to things like that which are not common sense
if toussaint were here resumed jean valjean like a person who is driven to seek authorities and who clutches at every branch she would be the first to agree that it is true that i have always had ways of my own
there is nothing new in this
i always have loved my black corner
but it is cold here
one can not see distinctly
it is abominable that it is to wish to be monsieur jean
i will not have you say' ylu' home
just now as i was coming higher replied jean valjean i saw a piece of furniture in the rue saint louis
it was at a cabinet maker's
if i were a pretty woman i would treat myself to that bit of furniture
a very neat toilet table in the reigning style
what you call rosewood i think
it is inlaid
the mirror is quite large
there are drawers
it is pretty
you
the villainous bear
replies cosette
and with supreme grace setting her teeth and drawing back her lips she blew at jean valjean
she was a grace copying a cat
i am curious she resumed
ever since yesterday you have made me rage all of you
i am greatly vexed
idon't understand
you do not defend me against marius
marius will not uphold me against you
i am all alone
i arrange a chamber prettily
if i could have put the good god there i would have done it
my chamber is left on my hands
my lodger sends me into bankruptcy
i order a nice little dinner of nicolette
we will have nothing to do with your dinner madame
and my father gauche le vent wants me to call him' monsieur jean' and to receive him in a frightful old ugly cellar where the walls have beards and where the crystal consists of empty bottles and the curtains are of spiders' webs
you are singular i admit that is your style but people who get married are granted a truce
you ought not to have begun being singular again instantly
so you are going to be perfectly contented in your abominable rue del' homme arms
i was very desperate indeed there that i was
what have you against me
you cause me a great deal of grief
fi
and becoming suddenly serious she gazed intently at jean valjean and added are you angry with me because i am happy
ingenuous news sometimes unconsciously penetrates deep
this question which was simple for cosette was profound for jean valjean
cosette had meant to scratch and she lacerated
jean valjean turned pale
he remained for a moment without replying then with an inexpressible intonation and speaking to himself he murmured her happiness was the object of my life
how god may sign my dismissal
cosette thou art happy my day is over
ah you have said thou home
exclaimed cosette
and she sprang to his neck
jean valjean in bewilderment a trained her wildly to his breast
it almost seemed to him as though he were taking her back
thanks father
said cosette
this enthusiastic impulse was on the point of becoming poignant for jean valjean
he gently removes cosette's arms and took his hat
well
said cosette
i leave you madame they are waiting for you
and from the threshold he added i have said thou to you
tell your husband that this shall not happen again
pardon me
jean valjean quitted the room leaving cosette stupefied at this enigmatic al farewell
chapter ii another step backwards in the following day at the same hour jean valjean came
cosette asked him to questions was no longer astonished no longer exclaimed that she was cold no longer spoke of the drawing room she avoided saying either father of monsieur jean
she allowed herself to be addressed as you
she allowed herself to be called madame
only her joy had undergone a certain diminution
she would have been sad of sadness had been possible to her
it is probable that she had had with marius one of those conversations in which the beloved man says what he pleases explains nothing and satisfies the beloved woman
the curiosity of lovers does not extend very far beyond their own love
the lower room had made a little toilet
basque had suppressed the bottles and nicolette the spiders
all the days which followed brought jean valjean at the same hour
he came everyday because he had not the strength to take marius' words otherwise than literally
marius arranged matters so as to be absent at the hours when jean valjean came
the house grew accustomed to the novel ways of m
gauche le vent
toussaint helped in this direction monsieur has always been like that she repeated
the grandfather issued this decree he's an original
and all was said
moreover at the age of ninety six no bond is any longer possible all is merely juxtaposition a newcomer is in the way
there is no longer any room all habits are acquired
m
catch eleventh
tranche le vent father ville norm and asked nothing better than to be relieved from that gentleman
he added nothing is more common than those originals
they do all sorts of queer things
they have no reason
the marquis de ca naples was still worse
he bought a palace that he might lodge in the garret
these are fantastic appearances that people affect
no one caught a glimpse of the sinister foundation
and moreover who could have guessed such a thing
there are marshes of this description in india
the water seems extraordinary inexplicable rippling though there is no wind and agitated where it should be calm
one gazes at the surface of these cause less ebullition some does not perceive the hydra which crawls on the bottom
many men have a secret monster in this same manner a dragon which gnaws them a despair which inhabits their night
such a man resembles other men heroes and comes
no one knows that he bears within him a frightful parasitic pain with a thousand teeth which lives within the unhappy man and of which he is dying
no one knows that this man is a gulf
he is stagnant but deep
from time to time a trouble of which the onlooker understands nothing appears on his surface
a mysterious wrinkle is formed then vanished the new appears an air bubble rises and bursts
it is the breathing of the unknown beast
certain strange habits arriving at the hour when other people are taking their leave keeping in the background when other people are displaying themselves preserving on all occasions what may be designated as the wall colored mantle seeking the solitary walk preferring the deserted street avoiding any share in conversation avoiding crowds and festivals seeming at one's ease and living poorly having one's key in one's pocket and one's candle at the porter's lodge however fish one may be entering by the side door ascending the private staircase all these insignificant singularities fugitive folds of the surface often proceed from a formidable foundation
many weeks passed in this manner
and spice gradually took possession of suzette the relations which marriage creates visits the care of the house pleasures great matters
cosette's pleasures were not costly they consisted in one thing being with marius
the great occupation of her life was to go out with him to remain with him
it was for them a joy that was always fresh to go out admin admin the face of the sun in the open street without giving themselves before the whole world both of them completely alone
cosette had one vexation
toussaint could not get on with nicolette the soldering of two elderly maids being impossible and she went away
the grandfather was well marius argued a case here and the rest neville norm and peacefully led that life aside which sufficed for her beside the new household
jean valjean came every day
the address as thou disappeared the youths madame the monsieur jean rendered him another person to cosette
the care which he had himself taken to detach her from him was succeeding
she became more and more gay and less and less tender
yet she still loved him sincerely and he felt it
one day she said to him suddenly you used to be my father you are no longer my father you were my uncle you are no longer my uncle you were monsieur gauche le vent you are jean
who are you then
idon't like all this
if i did not know how told you are i should be afraid of you
he still lived in the rue del' homme arms because he could not make up his mind to remove to a distance from the quarter where do set herself
at first he only remained a few minutes with cosette and then went away
little by little he acquired the habit of making his visits less brief
one would have said that he was taking advantage of the authorization of the days which were lengthening he arrived earlier and departed later
one day cosette chanced to say father to him
a flash of joy illuminated jean valjean's melancholy old coin tenance
he caught her up say jean
ah
truly she replied with a burst of laughter monsieur jean
that is right said he
and he turned aside so that she might not see him wipe his eyes
chapter iii they recall the garden of the rue plumer this was the last time
after that last flash of light complete extinction ensure
no more familiarity no more good morning with a kiss nevermore that word so profoundly sweet my father
he was at his own request and through his own complicity driven out of all his happiness es one after the other and he had this sorrow that after having lost cosette wholly in one day he was afterwards obliged to lose her again in detail
the eye eventually becomes accustomed to the light of a cellar
in short it suffices for him to have an apparition of cosette every day
his whole life was concentrated in that one hour
he seated himself close to her he gazed at her in silence or he talked to her of years gone by other childhood of the convent of her little friends of those bygone days
one afternoon it was on one of those early days in april already warm and fresh the moment of the sun's great gayety the gardens which surrounded the windows of marius and cosette felt the emotion of waking the hawthorn was on the point of budding and well edgar nitude of billy flowers spread over the ancient walls snapdragons yawned through the crevices of the stones amid the grass there was a charming beginning of daisies and butter cups the white butterflies of the year were making their first appearance the wind that minstrel of the eternal wedding was trying in the trees the first notes of that grand auroral symphony which the old posts called the spring tide mark is said to cosette we said that we would go back to take a look at our garden in the tie plumer
let us go thither
we must not be ungrateful
and a way they flitted like two swallows towards the spring
this garden of the rue plumer produced on them the effect of the dawn
they already had behind them in life something which was like the springtime of their love
the house in the fuel limey being held on a lease still belonged to cosette
they went to that garden and that house
there they found themselves again there they forgot themselves
that evening at the usual your jean valjean came to the rue des filles ducal faire
madame went out with monsieur and has not yet returned bass he said to jim
he seated himself in silence and waited an hour
cosette did not return
he departed with dropping read
cosette was so intoxicated with her walk to their garden and so joyous at having lived a whole day in her past that she talked of nothing else on the morrow
she did not notice that she had not seen jean valjean
in what way did you go thither
jean valjean asked her
on foot
and how did you return
in a hackney carriage
for some time jean valjean had noticed the economical life led by the young people
he was troubled by it
marius' economy was severe and that word had its absolute meaning for jean valjean
he has added a query why do you not have a carriage of your own
a pretty coupe would only cost you five hundred francs a month
you are rich
idon't know replied cosette
it is like toussaint resumed jean valjean
she is gone
you have not replaced her
why
nicolette suffices
but you ought to have a maid
have i got marius
you ought to have a house of your own your own servants a carriage a box at the theatre
there is nothing too fine for you
why not profit by your riches
wealth adds to happiness
cosette made no reply
jean valjean's visits were not abridged
far from it
when it is the heart which is slipping one does not halt on the downward slope
when jean valjean wished to prolong his visit and to induce forgetfulness of the hour he sang the praises of marius he pronounced him handsome noble courageous witty eloquent good
cosette out due him
jean valjean began again
they were never weary
marius that word was inexhaustible those six letters contained volumes
in this manner jean valjean contrived to remain a long time
it was so sweet to see cosette to forget by her side
it alleviated his wounds
it frequently happened that basque came twice to announce m
ville norm and sends me to remind madame la baronne that dinner is served
on those days jean valjean was very thoughtful on his return home
was there then any truth in that comparison of the chrysalis which had presented itself to the kind of marius
was jeanna i mean really a chrysalis who would persist and who would come to visit his butterfly
one day he remains'd still longer than usual
on the following day he observed that there was no fire on the hearth
hello
he thought
no fire
and he furnished the explanation for himself
it is perfectly simple
it is april
the cold weather has ceased
heavens
how cold it is here
exclaimed cosette when she entered
why no. said jean valjean
await you who told basque not to make a fire then
yes since we are now in the month of may
but we have a fire until june
one is needed all the year in this cellar
i thought that a fire was unnecessary
that is exactly like one of your ideas
retorted cosette
on the following day there was a fire
but the two arm chairs were arranged at the other end of the room near the door
what is the meaning of this
thought jean valjean
he went for the armchairs and restored them to their ordinary place near the hearth
this bird lighted once more encouraged him however
he prolonged the conversation even beyond its customary limits
as he rose to take his leave cosette said to him my husband said a queer thing to me yesterday
what was it
he said to me' cosette we have an income of thirty thousand livers
twenty seven that you own and three that my grandfather gives me
' i replied' that makes thirty
' he went on' would you have the courage to live on the three thousand
' i answered' yes on nothing
provided that it was with you
' and then i asked' why do you say that time
' he replied' i wanted to know
' jean valjean found not a word to answer
cosette probably expected some explanation from him he listened in gloomy silence
he went back to the rue del' homme arms he was so deeply absorbed that he mistook the door and instead of entering his own house he entered the adjoining dwelling
it was only after having ascended nearly two stories that he perceived his error and went down again
his mind was swarming with conjectures
it was evident that marius had his doubts as to the origin of the six hundred thousand francs that he feared some source that was not pure who knows
that he had even perhaps discovered that the money came from him jean valjean that he hesitated before this suspicious fortune and was disinclined to take it as his own preferring that both teams cosette should remain poor rather than that they should be rich with wealth that was not clean
moreover jean valjean began vaguely to surmise that he was being shown the door
on the following day he underwent something like a shock on entering the ground floor room
the arm chairs had disappeared
there was not a single chair of any sort
at what's this
exclaimed cosette as she entered no chairs
where are the arm chairs
they are no longer here replied jean valjean
this is too much
jean valjean stammered it was i am i told basque to remove them
and your reason
i have only a few minutes to stay today
a brief stay is no reason for remaining standing
i think that basque needed the chairs for the drawing room
why
you have company this evening no doubt
we expect no one
jean valjean had not another word to say
cosette shrugged her shoulders
to have the chairs carried off
the other day you had the fire put out
how odd you are
adieu
murmured jean valjean
he did not say adieu cosette
but he had not the strength to say adieu madame
he went away utterly overwhelmed
this time he had understood
on the following day he did not come
cosette only observed the fact in the evening
why said she monsieur jean has not been here today
and she felt a slight twinge at her heart but she hardly perceived it being immediately diverted by a kiss from marius
on the following day he did not come
cosette paid no need to this passed her evening and slept well that night as usual and thought of it only when she woke
she was so happy
she speedily despatched nicolette tom
jean's house to inquire whether he were ill and why he had not come on the previous evening
nicolette brought back the reply oem
mean that he was not ill
he was busy
he would come soon
as soon as he was able
moreover he was on the point of taking a little journey
madame must remember that it was his custom to take trips from time to time
they were not to worry about him
they were not to think of him
nicolette on entering m
jean's had repeated to him her mistress' very words
that madame had sent her to inquire why m
jean had not come in the preceding evening
it is two days since i have been there said jean valjean gently
but there mark passed unnoticed by nicolette who did not report it to cosette
chapter iv attraction and extinction during the last months of spring and the first months of summer in the rare passersby in the marais the petty shopkeepers the loungers on thresholds noticed an old man nearly clad in black who emerged every day at the same hour towards nightfall from the rue del' homme arms on the side of the rue saint e croix de la breton net is passed in front of the blanc's mantra is gained the the culture sainte catherine and on arriving at the rue del' scharpf turned to the left and entered the rue saint louis
there he walked at a slow pace with his head strained forward seeing nothing hearing nothing his eye imho vault fixed on a point which seemed to be a star to him which never varied and which was no other than the corner of the rue des filles ducal faire
the nearer he approached the corner of the street them off his eye lighted up a sort of joy illuminated his pupils like an inward aurora he had a fascinated and much affected air his lips indulged in obscure movements as though he were talking to someone whom he did not see he smiled vaguely and advanced as slowly as possible
one would have said that while desirous of reaching his destination he feared the moment when he should be close at hand
when only a few houses remained between him and that street which appeared to attract him his pace slackened to such a degree that at times one might have thought that he was no longer advancing at all
the vacillation of his head and the fixity of his eyeballs suggested the thought of the magnetic needle seeking the pole
whatever time he spent on arriving he was obliged to arrive at last he reached the rue des filles ducal faire then he halted he trembled he thrust his head with a sort of melancholy timidity round the corner of the last house and gazed into that street and there was in that tragic look something which resembled the dazzling light of the impossible and the reflection from a paradise that was closer to him
then a year which had slowly gathered in the corner of his life and has become large enough to fall trickled down his cheek and sometimes stopped at his mouth
the old man tasted it's bitter flavor
thus he remained for several minutes as though made of stone then he returned by the same road and with the same step and in proportion as he retreated his glance died out
little by little this old man ceased to go as far as the corner of the rue des filles ducal faire he halted halfway in the rue saint louis sometimes a little further off sometimes a little nearer
one day he stopped at the corner of the rue culture sainte catherine and looked at the rue des filles du vald' aide from a distance
then he shook his head slowly from right to left as though refusing himself something and retraced his steps
soon be no longer same as far as the rue saint louis
he got as far as the rue pages shook his head and turned back then hear it no further than the rue des trois pavilions then he did not overstep the blanc's mantra us
one would have said that he was a pendulum which was no longer wound up and whose oscillations were growing shorter before ceasing altogether
every day he emerged from his house at the same hour he undertook the same trip but he no longer completed it and perhaps without himself being aware of the fact he constantly shortened it
his whole countenance expressed this single idea what is the use
his eye was combo more radiance
his tears were also exhausted they no longer collected in the corner of his eye lid that thoughtful eye was dry
the old man's head was still cranes forward his chin moved at times the folds in his haunt neck were painful to behold
sometimes when the weather was bad he had an umbrella under his arm but he never opened in
the good women of the quarter said he is an innocent
the children followed him and laughed
book ninth
supreme shadow supreme dawn chapter i pity for the unhappy but indulgence for the happy it is a terrible thing to be happy
how content one is
how all sufficient one finds it
now being in possession of the false object of life happiness one forgets the true object duty
let us say however that the reader would do wrong we tend to blame marlys
marius as we have explained before his marriage had put no questions tom
gauche le vent and since that time he had feared to put any go jean valjean
he had regretted the promise into which he had allowed himself to be drawn
he had often said to himself that he had done wrong in making that concession to despair
he had confined himself to gradually est ranging jean valjean from his house and rose facing him as much as possible from cosette's mind
he had in a manner always placed himself between cosette and jean valjean sure that in this way she would not perceive not think of the latter
it was more than effacement it was an eclipse
marius did what he cons of the d necessary and judy
he thought that he had serious reasons which the reader has already seen and others which will be seen later on for getting rid of jean valjean without harshness but without weakness
chance having ordained that he should encounter in a case which he had argued a former employee of the laffitte establishment he had acquired mysterious information without seeking it which he had not been able it is true to probe out of respect for the secret which he had promised to guard and out of consideration for jean valjean's perilous position
he believed at that moment that he had a grave duty to perform the restitution of the six hundred thousand francs to someone whom he sought with all possible discretion
in the meanwhile he abstained from touching that money
as for cosette she had not been initiated into any of these secrets but it would be harsh to condemn her also
there existed between marius and he ran all powerful magnetism which caused her to do instinctively and almost mechanically what marius wishes
she was conscious of marius' will in the direction of monsieur jeans be conformed to it
her husband had not been obliged to say anything to her she yielded to the vague but clear pressure of his facit intentions and obeyed blindly
net obedience in this instance consisted in not remembering what marius forgot
she was not obliged to make any effort to accomplish this
without her knowing why herself and without his having any cause to accuse her of other soul had become so wholly her husband's that that which was shrouded in bloom in marine' mind became overcast in here
let us not go too far however in what concerns jean valjean this forgetfulness and obliteration were merely superficial
she was rather need less than forgetful
at bottom she was sincerely attached to the man whom she had so long called her father but she loved her husband still more deadly
this was what had somewhat disturbed the balance of her heart which leaned to one side only
it sometimes happened that cosette spoke of jean valjean and expressed her surprise
then marius calmed her he is absent i think
did not he say that he was setting out on a journey
that is true thought cosette
he had a habit of disappearing in this fashion
but not for so long
two or three times she despatched nicolette to inquire in the rue del' homme arms whether m
jean had returned from his journey
jean valjean caused the answer go to be given
cosette asked nothing more since she had but one need on earth marius
let us also say that on their side cosette and marius had also been absent
they had been to vernon
marius had taken cosette to his father's grave
marius gradually won cosette away from jean valjean
cosette allowed it
moreover that which is called far too harshly in certain cases the ingratitude of children is not always a thing so deserving of reproach as it is supposed
it is the ingratitude of nature
nature as we have elsewhere said looks before her
nature divides living beings into those who are arriving and those who are departing
those who are departing are turned towards the shadows those who are arriving towards the light
hence a gulf which is fatal on the part of the old and involuntary on the part of the young
this breach at first insensible increases slowly like all separations of branches
the boughs without becoming detached from the trunk grow away from it
it is no fault of the irs
you throws where there is not festivals vivid lights love
old age goes towards the end
they do not lose sight of each other but there is no longer a close connection
young people feel the cooling off of life old people that if the tomb
let us not blame these poor children
chapter ii last flickering sofa lamp without lil one day jean valjean descended his staircase took three steps in the street seated himself on a post on that same stone post where gave if he had found him meditating on the night between the thanet method june he remained there a few moments then went upstairs again
this was the last oscillation of the pendulum
on the following day he did not leave his apartment
on the day after that he did not leave his bed
his port fees who prepared his scanty repast's a few cabbages or potatoes with bacon glanced at the brown earthenware plate and exclaimed but you are nothing yesterday poor dear man
certainly i did replied jean valjean
the plate is quite full
look at the water jug
it is empty
that proves that you have drunk it does not prove that you have eaten
well said jean valjean what if i felt hungry only for water
that is called thirst and when one does not eat at the same time it is called fever
i will eat tomorrow
or at trinity day
why not today
is it the thing to say' i will eat tomorrow'
the idea of leaving my platter without even touching it
my lady finger potatoes were so good
jean valjean took the old woman's hand i promise you that i will eat them he said in his benevolent voice
i am not pleased with you replied the port ress
jean valjean saw no other human creature than this good woman
there are streets in paris through which no one ever passes and houses to which no one ever comes
he was in one of those streets and one of those houses
while he still went out he had purchased of a coppersmith for a few sous a little copper crucifix which he had hung upon a nail opposite his bed
that gibbet is always good to look at
a week passed and jean valjean had not taken a step in his room
he still remained in bed
the port fees said to her husband the goodman upstairs yonder does not get up he no longer says he will not last long
that man had his sorrows that he has
youwon't get it out of my head that his daughter has made a bad marriage
the porter replied with the tone of marital sovereignty if he's rich let him have a doctor
if he is not rich let him go without
if he has no doctor he will die
and if he has ons
he will die said the porter
the port re asset to scraping away the grass from what she called her pavement with an old knife and as she tore out the blade as he grumbledit'sa shame
such a new goodman
he's as white as a chicken
she caught sight of the doctor of the quarter as he passed the end of the streets he took it upon herself to request him to come upstairs
it's on the second floor said she
you have only to enter
as the goodman no longer suits from his bed the door is always unlocked
the doctor saw jean valjean and spoke with him
when he came down again the port read interrogated him well doctor
your sick man is very ill indeed
what is the matter with him
everything and nothing
he is a man who go all appearances has lost some person who is dear to him
people die of that
what did he say to you
he told me that he was in good health
shall you come again doctor
yes replied the doctor
but someone else besides must come
chapter iii a penis heavy to the man who lifted the gauche le vent's cast one evening jean valjean found difficulty in raising himself on his elbow he felt of his wrist and could not find his pulse his breath was short and halted at times he recognized the fact that he was weaker than he had ever been before
then no doubt under the pressure of some supreme preoccupation he made an effort drew himself up into a sitting posture and dressed himself
he put on his old workingman's clothes
as he no longer went out he had returned to them and preferred them
he was obliged to pause many times while dressing himself merely putting his arms through his waistcoat made the perspiration trickle from his flee news
since he had been alone he had placed his bed in the antec two her in order to inhabit that deserted apartment as little as possible
he opened the valise and drew from it cosette's outfit
he spread it out on his bed
the bishop's candlesticks were in their place on the chimney piece
he took from a drawer two wax candles and put them in the candlesticks
then although it was still broad daylight it was summer he lighted them
in the same way candles are to be seen lighted in broad daylight in chambers where there is a corpse
every step that he took in going from one piece of furniture to another exhausted him and he was obliged to sit down
it was not ordinary fatigue which expends the strength only to renew it it was the remnant of all movement possible to him it was love drained which blows away drop by drop in overwhelming efforts and which will never be ram feed
the chair into which he allowed himself to fall was placed in front of that mirrors of a two for him so providential for marius in which he had read cosette's reversed writing on the blotting book
he caught sight of himself in this mirror and did not recognize himself
he was eighty years old before marius' marriage he would have hardly been taken for fifty that year had counted for thirty
what he bore on his brow was no longer the wrinkles of age it was the mysterious mark of death
the hollowing of that pitiless bail could be felt there
his cheeks were pendulous the skin of his face had the color which would lead one to think that it already had earth upon it the corners of his mouth dropped as in the mask which the ancients sculptures on tombs
he gazed into space with an air of reproach one would have said that he was one of those grand text is beings who have cause to complain of someone
he was in that condition the last phase of rejection in which sorrow no longer flows it is coagulated so to speak there is something on the soul like a clot of despair
night had come
he laboriously dragged a table and the old armchair to the fireside and placed upon the table a pen some ink and some paper
that done he had a fainting fit
when he recovered consciousness he was thirsty
as he could not lift the high still edit over painfully towards his mouth and swallowed a draught
as neither the penn of the ink had been used for a long time the point of the pen had curled up the only add ride away he was forced to rise and put a few drops of water in the ink which he did not accomplish without pausing and sitting down two or three times and he was compelled to write with the back of the pen
he wiped his brow from time to time
then he turned towards the bed and still seated for he could not stand he gazed at the little black gown and all those beloved objects
these contemplations lasted for hours which seemed minutes
all at once he shivered he felt that a child was taking possession of him he rested his elbows on the table which was illuminated by the bishop's candles and took up the pen
his hand trembled
he wrote slowly the few following lines cosette i bless thee
i am going to explain to the e
thy husband was right in giving me to understand that i ought to go away but there is a little error in what he believed though he was in the right
he is excellent
love him well even after i am dead
monsieur pont mercy love my darling child well
rosette this paper will be found this is what i wish to say to thee thou wilt see the figures if i have the strength to recall them listen well this money is really thine
here is the whole matter white jet comes from norway black jet comes from england black glass jewellery comes from germany
jet is the lightest the most precious the most costly
imitations can be made in france as well as in germany
what is needed is a little anvil two inches square and a lamp burning spirits of wine to soften the wax
the wax was formerly made with resin and lamp black and cost four livres the pound
i invented a way of making it with him shellac and turpentine
it does not cost more than thirty sons and is much better
buckles are made with a violet glass which is stuck fast by means of this was to a little framework of black iron
the glass must be violet for iron jewellery and black for gold jewellery
spain buys a great deal of it
it is the country of jet
here he paused the pen fell from his fingers he was seized by one of those sins which at times welled up from the very depths of his being the poor man clasped his head in both hands and meditated
oh
he exclaimed within himself lamentable cries heard by god alone all is over
i shall never seemed more
she is a smile which passed over me
i am about to plunge into the night without even seeing her again
oh
one minute one instant to hear her voice to touch her dress to gaze upon her upon her the angel
and then to die
it is nothing to die what is frightful is to die without seeing her
she would smile on me she would say a word to me would that do any harm to anyone
go all is over and forever
merriam all alone
my god
my god
i shall never see her again
at that moment there came a knock at the door
chapter iv a bottle of ink which only succeeded in whitening that same day or to speak more accurately that same evening as marius left the table and saxon the point of withdrawing to his study having a case to look over basque handed him a letter saying the person who wrote the letter is in the antechamber
cosette had taken the grandfather's arm and was strolling in the garden
a letter like a man may have any more possessing exterior
coarse paper coarsely folded the very sight of certain missives is displeasing
the letter which basque had brought was of this sort
marius took it
it smelled of tobacco
nothing evokes a memory like an odor
marius recognized that tobacco
he looked at the eu perscription to monsieur monsieur le baron pom marci
a. this hotel
the recognition of the tobacco caused him to recognize the writing as well
it may be said that amazement has its lightning flashes
marius was as it were illuminated by one of these flashes
the sense of smell that mysterious aid to memory had just revived a whole world within him
this was certainly the paper the fashion of folding the full tint of ink it was certainly the well known handwriting especially was it the same tobacco
the jon dee the garret rose before his mind
this strange freak of chance
one of the two events which he had so diligently sought the one in connection with which he had lately again exerted so many efforts and which he supposed to be forever lost had come and presented itself to him of its own accord
he eagerly broke the seal and read monsieur le baron of the supreme being had given me the talents i might have been bar on the hard member of the institute academy of ciences but i am not
i only bear the same as him happy if this memory recommends me to the excellence of your kindnesses
the benefit with which you will honor he will be recipe ocle
i am in possession of a secret concerning an individual
this individual concerns you
i hold the secretary our disposal desiring to have the honor to get useful to you
i will furnish you with the simple means of driving from your honor abel family that individual who has no right there madame la baronne being of lofty birth
the aamft gary of virtue can not cohabit longer with crime without abdicating
i aware in the enti chamber the orders of monsieur le baron
with respect
the latter was signed the bard
this signature was not false
it was merely a trifle abridged
moreover the rigmarole and the orthography completed the revelation
the certificate of origin was complete
marius's motion was profound
after a start of surprise he underwent a feeling of happiness
if he could now but find that other man of whom he was in search the man who had saved him marius there would be nothing left for him to desire
he opened the drawer of his secretary took out several banknotes put them in his pocket closed the secretary again and rang the help
basque half opened the door
show the man in said marius
basque announced monsieur the nafd
a man entered
a fresh surprise for marius
the man who entered was a bitter strange erotik
this man who was old moreover had a thick nose his chin swathed in a cravath teen spectacles with a double screen of green taffeta over his eyes and his hair was plastered and flattened down on his brow on a level with his eyebrows like the wigs of english coachmen in high life
his hair was gray
he was dressed in black from heart of log in garments that were very threadbare but clean a bunch of seals depending from his bob suggested the idea of a watch
he held in his hand an old hag
he walked in a bent attitude and the curve in his spine augmented the profundity of his bow
the first thing that struck the observer was that this personage's coat which was too ample although carefully buttoned had not been made for him
here a short digression becomes necessary
there was in paris at that epoch in a low lived old lodging in the rue be autre i'll is near the arsenal an ingenious jew whose profession was to change villains into honest men
not for too long which might have proved embarrassing for the villain
the change was insight for a day or two at the fate of thirty sousa day by means of a costume which resembled the honesty of the world in general as nearly as possible
this costumer was called the changed the pickpockets of parks had given him this name and knew him by no other
he had a tolerably complete wardrobe
the rats with which he tricked out people were almost probable
he had specialties and categories on each nail of his shop hung a social status thread care and did i hate the suit of a magistrate there the outfit of acute beyond the outfit of a banker in one corner the costume of a retired military man elsewhere then a bill ments of a man of letters and further on the dress of a statesman
this creature was the costumer of the immense drama which in a very plays in paris
his lair was the green room whence theft emerged and into which to hurry retreated
a tattered i have arrived at this dressing room deposited his thirty sous and selected according to the part which he wished to play the costume which suited him and in descending the stairs once more the knave was a somebody
on the following day the clothes were faithfully returned and the changer who trusted the thieves with everything was never robbed
there was one inconvenience about these clothes they did not fit not having been made for those who wore them they were too fight for one too loose for another and did not adjust themselves to anyone
every pickpocket who exceeds for fell short of the human averages as i lost his ease in the chamber's costumes
it was necessary that one should not be either too fat or too lean
the changer had foreseen only ordinary men
he had taken the measure of the species from the first rascal who came to hand who is neither stony north in neither tall not short
hence adaptations which were sometimes difficult and from which the chamber's clients extricated themselves as best they might
so much the worse for the exceptions
the suit of the statesman for instance black from head to foot and consequently proper would have been too large for pitt and too small for cartel viva la
the costume of a statesman was designated as follows in the chamber's catalogue we copy a coat of black cloth grow sets of black wool a silk waistcoat boots and linen
on the margin there stood ex ambassador and a note which we also copy in a separate box and at my frizz experi of green glasses seals and two small quills an inch long wrapped in cotton
all this belonged to the statesman the ex ambassador
this whole costumes as if we may so express ourselves debilitated the seams were quite a vague button hole tawnee stone of the elbows moreover one of the cost buttons was missing on the breast but this was only detail as the hand of the statesman should always be thrust into his coat and laid upon his heart its function was to const so the absent button
if marius had been familiar with the occult institutions of paris he would instantly have recognized upon the back of the visitor whom basque had just shown in the statesman's suit borrowed from the pick me down that's top of the changer
marius' disappointment on beholding another man than the one whom he expected to see turned to the newcomer's disadvantage
he surveyed him from head to foot while that person are made exaggerated bows and demanded in a curt tone what do you want
the man replied with an amiable grin of which the caressing smile of a crocodile will furnish some idea it seems to me impossible that i should not have already had the honor of seeing monsieur le baron in society
i think i actually did meet monsieur personally several years ago at the house of madame la princesse narration and in the drawing rooms of his lordship the vicomte cambray peer of france
it is always a good bit of tactics in on avery to pretend to recognize someone who mind does not know
marius paid attention to the manner of this man's speech
he spied on his accent and texture but his disappointment increased the pronunciation was nasal and absolutely unlike the dry shrilly one which he had expected
he was utterly router
i know neither madame va gration norm
cambray said he
i have never set foot in the house of either of them in my life
the reply was ungracious
the person are determined to be gracious at any cost insisted
then it must have been at chateaubriand's that i have seen monsieur
i know chateaubriand very well
he is very affable
he sometimes says to me' then add my friend
don't you drink a glass of wine with me
' marius' brown few more and more severe i have never had the honor of being received by m
we chateaubriand
let us cut it short
what do you want
the man bowed lower at that harsh voice
monsieur le baron deign to listen to me
there is in america in a district near panama a village called la joya
that village is composed of a single house a large square house of three stories built on bricks dried in the sun each side of the square five hundred feet in length each story retreating twelve feet back of the story below in such a manner as to leave in front a terrace which makes the circuit of the edifice in the centre an inner court where the provisions and munitions are kept no windows loopholes no doors ladders ladders to mount from the ground to the first terrace and from the first to the second and from the second to the third ladders to descend into the inner court no. doors to the chambers trap doors no staircases to the chambers ladders in the evening the traps are closed the ladders are withdrawn carbines and bouncer busses trained from the loopholes no means of entering a house by data citadel by night eight hundred inhabitants that is the village
why so many precautions
because the country is dangerous it is full of cannibals
then why do people got here
because the country is marvellous gold is found there
what are you driving at
interrupted marius who had passed from disappointment to impatience
at this monsieur le baron
i am an old and weary diplomat
ancient civilization has thrown me on my own devices
i want to try savages
well
monsieur le baron egotism is the law of the world
the pro is tarian peasant woman who tools by the day turnaround when the diligence passes by the peasant propri stress who tools in her field does not turn round
the dog of the poor man barks at the hochman the dog of the rich man barks at the poorman
each one for himself
self interest that's the object of men
gold that's the load stone
what then
finish
i should like to go and establish myself at la joya
there are three of us
i have my spouse and my young lady a very beautiful girl
the journey is long and costly
i need a little money
what concern is that of mine
demanded marius
the stranger stretched his neck out of his cravat a gesture characteristic of the culture and replied with an augmented smile
has not monsieur le baron perused my letter
there was some truth in this
the fact is that the contents of the epistle had slipped marius' mind
he had seen the writing rather than read the letter
he could hardly recall it
but a moment ago a fresh start had been given him
he had noted that detail my spouse and my young lady
he fixed a penetrating glance on the stranger
an examining judge could not have done the look better
he almost latin wait for him
he confined him we if no replying state the case precisely
the stranger inserted his two hands in both his dogs drew himself up without straightening his dorsal column but scrutinizing marius in his turn with the green gaze of his spectacles
so be it monsieur le baron
i will be precise
i have a secret to sell to you
a secret
ass vest
which concerns me
somewhat
what is the secret
marius scrutinized the man more and more as he listened to him
i commence gratis said the stranger
you will see that i am interesting
speak
monsieur le baron you have in your house a thief and an assassin
marius shuddered
in my house
no. said he
the imperturbable stranger brushed his hat with his elbow and went on an assassin and a thief
remark monsieur le baron that i do not here speak of ancient deeds deeds of the last which have lapsed which can be effaced by limitation before the law and by repentance before god
i speak of recent deeds of actual fact was still unknown to justice at this hour
i continue
this man has insinuated himself into your confidence and almost into your family under a false name
i am about to tell you his real name
and to tell it to you for nothing
i am listening
his name is jean valjean
i know it
i am going to tell you equally for nothing who hris
canon
he is an ex convict
i know it
you know it since i have had the honor of telling you
no
i knew it before
marius' cold tone that double reply if i know it his laconic i am which was not favorable to dialogue stirred up some smouldering wrath in the stranger
he launched a furious glance on the sky at marius which was instantly extinguished
rapid as it was this glance was of the mind which a man recognized when he has once be held it it did not escape marius
certain flashes can only proceed from certain souls the eye that vent hole of the thought glows with it spectacles hide nothing try putting a land of glass over help
the stranger resumed with a smile i will not permit myself to contradict monsieur le baron
in any case you ought to perceive that i am well informed
now what i have to tell you is known to myself alone
this concerns the god duke of madame la baronne
it is an extraordinary secret
it is for sale u make you the first offer of it
cheap
twenty thousand francs
i know that secret as well as the others said marius
the person she felt the necessity of lowering his pride a trifle
monsieur le baron say ten thousand francs and i will speak
i repeat to you that there is nothing which you can tell me
i know what you wish to say home
a fresh flash gleamed in the man's eye
he exclaimed but i just fine today nevertheless
it is an extraordinary secret i tell you
monsieur le baron i will speak
i speak
give me twenty france
marius based intently at him i know your extraordinary secret just as i knew jean valjean's name just as i know your name
my name
yes
that is not difficult monsieur le baron
i had the honor to write to you and to tell it to you
the bard
rier
heh
the barrier
who's that
in danger the porcupine bristles up the beetle reigns death the old guard forms in a square this man burst into laughter
then he flicked a grain of dust from the sleeve of his coat with a fillip
marius continued you are also jon dee the the workman eagan you the comedian ten foot the lost donald are's the spaniard and mistress bali card
mistress what
and you kept a lot house at mont vermeil
a lot house
never
and i tell you that your name is the barrier
i deny it
and that you are a rascal
here
and marius drew a bank note from his pocket and fling it in his face
thanks
pardon me
five hundred francs
monsieur le baron
and the man overcome bowed seized the note and examined it
five hundred francs
he began again taken aback
and he stammered in a low voice an honest rustler
then brusquely well done it
he exclaimed
let us put ourselves at our ease
and with the ability of a monkey flinging back his hair tearing off his spectacles and withdrawing from his nose by sleight of hand the two quills of which mention was recently made and which the reader has also met within another page of this book he took off his face as the man takes off his hat
his eye lighted up his uneven bros. with hollows in some places and bumps in others hideously wrinkled at the top was laid bare his nose had become as sharp as a beak the fierce and sagacious profile of the man of prey reappeared
monsieur le baron is infallible he said in a clear voice whence all nasal twang had disappeared i am the barrier
and he straightened up his crooked back
the barrier for it was really he was strangely surprised he would have been troubled had he been capable of such a thing
he had come to bring astonishment and it was he who had received it
this humiliation had been worth five hundred francs to him and taking it all in all he accepted it but he was nonetheless bewildered
he beheld this baron pont mercy for the first time and in spite of his disguise this baron pont mercy recognized him and recognized him thoroughly
and not only was thus far on perfectly informed as to the nerdier but he seemed well posted as to jean valjean
who was this almost beardless young man who was so glacial and so generous who knew people's names who knew all their names and who opened his purse to them who bullied rascals like a judge and who paid them like a dupe
the harrier the reader will remember although he had been marius' neighbor had never seen him which is not unusual in paris he had formerly in a vague way heard his daughter's talk of a very poor young man named markus who lived in the house
he had written to him without knowing him the letter with which the reader is acquainted
no connection between that marius and n
lebaron pont mercy was possible in his mind
as for the name pont mercy it will be recalled that on the battlefield of waterloo he had only heard the last two syllables for which he always entertained the legitimate scorn which one owes to what is merely an expression of thanks
however through his daughters selma who had started on the scent of the man died pair ont meth of february and through his own personal researches he had succeeded in learning many things and from the depths of his own gloom he had contrived to grasp more than one mysterious view
he had discovered by dint of industry or at least by dint of induction he had guessed who the man was whom he had encountered on a certain day in the grand sewer
from the man he had easily reached the name
he knew that madame la baronne pont mercy was cosette
but he meant to be discreet in that quarter
who was rosette
he did not know exactly himself
he did indeed catch an inkling of illegitimacy the history off anyone had always seemed to him equivocal but what was the use of talking about that
in order to cause himself to be paid for his silence
he had or thought he had better wages than that for sale
and according to all appearances if he were to come and make to the baron pont mercy this revelation and without proof your wife is a bastard the only result would be to attract the foot of the husband towards the loins of the revealer
from the barrier's point of view the conversation with marius had not yet begun
he ought to have drawn back to have modified his strategy to have abandoned his position to have changed his front but nothing essential had been compromised as yet and he had five hundred francs in his pocket
moreover he had something decisive today and even against this very well informed and well armed baron pont mercy he felt himself strong
for men of the barrier's nature every dialogue is a combat
in the one in which he was about to engage what was his situation
he did not know to whom he was speaking but he did know of what he was speaking he made this rapid review of his inner forces and after having said ian the barrier he waited
marius had become thoughtful
so he had told of the hardier at last
that man whom he had so greatly desires to find was before him
he could honor colonel pont mercy's recommendation
he felt humiliated that that hero should have owned anything to this villain and that the letter of change drawn from the depths of the tomb by his father upon him marius had been protested up to that day
it also seemed to him in the complex state of his mind towards the barrier that there was occasion to avenge the colonel for the misfortune of having been saved by such a rascal
in any case he was content
he was about to deliver the colonel's shade from this unworthy credit or at last and it seemed to him that he was on the point of rescuing his father's memory from the debtors' prison
by the side of this duty there was another to elucidate if possible the source of cosette's fortune
the opportunity appeared to present itself
perhaps the barrier knew something
it might prove useful to see the bottom of this man
he commenced with this
the barrier had caused the honest rustler to disappear in his bob and was gazing at marius with a gentleness that was almost tender
marius broke the silence
the barrier i have told you your name
how would you like to have me tell you your secret the one that you can where to reveal time
i have information of my own also
you shall see that i know more about it than you do
jean valjean as you have said is an assassin and a thief
a thief because he robbed a wealthy manufacturer whose ruin he brought about
an assassin because he assassinated police agent javert
idon't understands it ejaculated the barrier
i will make myself intelligible
in a certain arrondissement of the pas de calais there was in a man who had fallen out with justice and who under the name of k
madeleine had regained his status and rehabilitated himself
this man had become a just man in the full force of the term
in a trade the manufacture of black glass good she made the fortune of an entire city
as far as his personal fortune was concerned he made that also but as a secondary matter and in some sort by accident
he was the foster father of the poor
he founded hospitals opened schools visited the sick do we're a young girls supported widows and adopted orphans he was like the guardian angel of the country
he refused the cross he was xp pointed mayor
a liberated convict knew the secret of a penalty incurred by this man in former days he denounced him and had him arrested and profited by the arrest to come to paris and cause the banker laffitte i have the fact from the cashier himself by means of a false signature to handover to him the sum of over half a million which belonged to m
madeleine
this convict who robbed m
madeleine was jean valjean
as for the other fact you have nothing to tell me about it either
jean valjean killed the agent jager the shot him with a pistol
if he person who is speaking to you was present
the hardier cast upon marius the sovereign glance of a conquered man who lays his hand once more upon the victory and who has just retained in one instant all the ground which he has lost
but the smile returned instantly
the inferior's triumph in the presence of his superior must be a needling
the barrier contented himself with saying to marius monsieur le baron we are on the wrong track
and he emphasized this phrase by making his bunch of seals execute an expressive whirl
what
broke forth marius do you dispute that
these are facts
they are chimeras
the confidence with which monsieur le baron honors mr. renders it my duty to tell him so
truth and justice before all things
i do not like to see folks accused unjustly
monsieur le baron jean valjean did not rohm
madeleine and jean valjean did not kill javert
this is too much
how is this
for two reasons
what are they
speak
this is the first he did not robb
madeleine because it is jean valjean himself who was m.
madeleine
what tale are you tell in the
and this is the second he did not assassinate is very because the person who killed javert was javert
what do you mean to say
that is very committed suicide
prove it
prove it
cried marius beside himself
the barrier resumed scanning his phrase after the manner of the ancient alexandrine measure police agent javert was found crowned under a boat of the long au change
but prove it
the hardier drew from his pocket a large envelope of gray paper which seemed to contain sheets folded in different sizes
i have my papers he said calmly
and he added monsieur le baron in your interests i decided to know jean valjean thoroughly
i say that jean valjean and m
madeleine are one and the same man and i say that is very had no other assassin thanks very
if i speak it is because i have proofs
not manuscript proofs writing is suspicious handwriting is como la i want but printed proofs
as he spoke the barrier extracted from the envelope two copies of newspapers yellow faded and strongly saturated with tobacco
one of these two newspapers broken at every file and falling into rage seemed much older than the other
two facts two proofs remarked the hardier
and he offered the two newspapers unfolded to marius
the reader is acquainted with these two papers
one the most ancient a number of the drapeau blanc of the th of july the text of which can be seen in the first volume established the identity idm
madeleine and jean valjean
the others moniteur of the th of june announced the suicide of javert adding that it appeared from a verbal report of javert to the prefect that having been taken prisoner in the barricade of the rue de la chambre did he had owed his life to the magnanimity of an insurgent who holding him under his pistol had fired into the air instead of blowing out his brains
marius read
he had evidence a certain date of defrag able proof these two newspapers had not been printed expressly for the purpose of backing up the hard lee's statements the note printed in the moniteur had been an administrative communication from the prefecture of police
marius could not doubt
the information of the cashier clerk had been false and he himself had been deceived
jean valjean who had suddenly grown grand emerged from his cloud
marius could not repress a cry of joy
well then this unhappy wretch is an admirable man
the whole of that fortune really belonged to him
he is madeleine the providence of a whole countryside
he is jean valjean is very's savior
he is a hero
he is a saint
he's not a saint and he's not a hero
said the barrier
he's an assassin and a robber
and he added in the tone of a man who begins to feel that he possesses some authority let us he calm
robber assassin those words which marius thought had disappeared and which returned fell upon him like a nice cold shower bath
again
said he
always ejaculated the gardner
jean valjean did not rob madeleine but he is a thief
he did not kill is very but he is a murderer
will you speak retorted marius of that miserable theft committed forty years ago and expiate was your own newspapers prove by a whole life of repentance of self abnegation and of virtue
i say assassination and theft monsieur le baron and i repeat that i am speaking of actual facts
what i have to reveal to you is absolute it unknown
it belongs to unpublished matter
and perhaps you will find in it the source of the fortune so skilfully presented to madame la baronne by jean valjean
i say skilfully because by a gift of that nature it would not be so very un skilful to slip into an honorable house whose comfort zone would then share and at the same stroke to conceal one's crime and to enjoy one's theft to bury one's name and to create for oneself a family
i might interrupt you at this point said marius but goin
monsieur le baron i will tell you all leaving the recompense to your generosity
this secret is worth massive gold
you will say to me' why do not you apply to jean valjean
' for a very simple reason i know that he has stripped himself and stripped himself in your favor and i consider the combination ingenious but he has no longer a son he would show me his empty hands and since i am in need of some money for my trip to la joya i prefer you you who have it all to him who has nothing
i am a little fatigued permit me to take a chair
marius seated himself and motioned to him to do the same
the nerdier installed himself on a tufted chair picked up his two newspapers thrust them back into their envelope and murmured as he packed at the drapeau blanc with his nail it cost me a good deal of trouble to get this one
that done he crossed his legs and stretched himself out on the back of the chair an attitude characteristic of people who are sure of what they are saying then he entered upon his subject gravely emphasizing his words monsieur le baron ont meth of june about a year ago on the day of the insurrection a man was in the grand sewer of paris at the point where the sewer enters the seine between the pont des invalides and the pont de jena
marius abruptly drew his chair closer to that of the harriet
the hardier noticed this movement and continued with the deliberation of an orator who holds his interlocutor and who feels his adversary palpitating under his words this man forced to conceal him self and for reasons moreover which are fi deign to politics had adopted the sewer as his domicile and had a key to it
it was i repeat ont meth of june it might have been eighto'clock in the evening
the man hears a noise in the sewer
greatly surprised he gives himself and lies in salt
it was the sound of footsteps someone was walking in the dark and coming in his direction
strange to say there was another man in the sewer besides himself
the grating of the outlet from the sewer was not far off
a little light which fell through it permitted him to recognize the newcomer and to see that the man was carrying something on his back
he was walking in a bent attitude
the man who was walking in a debt attitude was an ex convict and what he was dragging on his shoulders was a corpse
assassination caught in the very active get there was such a thing
as for the theft that is understood one does not kill a man gratis
this convict was on his way to fling the body into the river
one fact is to be noticed that before reaching the exit grating this convict who had come a long distance in the sewer must necessarily have encountered a frightful quagmire where it seems as though he might have left the body but these we then would have found the assassinated man the very next day while at work on the quagmire and that did not suit the assassin's plans
he had preferred to traverse that quagmire with his burden and his exertions must have been terrible for it is impossible to risk one's life more completely idon't understand how he could have come out of that alive
marius' chair approached still nearer
the barrier took advantage of this to draw a long breath
he went on monsieur le baron a sewer is not the champ de mars
one lacks everything there even room
when two men are there they must meet
that is what happened
the man domiciled there and the passerby were forced to bid each other good day greatly to the regret of both
the passerby said to the inhabitant you see what i have on my back i must get out you have the key give it to me
that convict was a man of terrible strength
there was no way of refusing
nevertheless the man who had the key karl eyed simply yoga on time
he examined the dead man but he could see nothing except that the latter was young well dressed with the air of being rich and all disfigured with blood
while talking the man contrived to test and pull off behind without the assassin perceiving it a bit of the assassinated man's coat
a document for conviction you understand a means of recovering the trace of things and of bringing home the crime to the criminal
he put this document for conviction in his pocket
after which he opened the graying made the man go out with his embarrassment on his back closed the grating again and ran off not caring to be mixed up with the remainder of the adventure and above all not wishing to be present when the assassin threw the assassinated man into the river
now you comprehend
the man who was carrying the corpse was jean valjean the one who had the key is speaking to you at this moment and the piece of the cost
the barrier completed his phrase by drawing from his pocket and holding on a level with his eye shipped between his two thumbs and his two forefinger east top of torn black cloth all covered with dark spots
marius had sprung to his best pals hardly able to draw his breath with his eyes riveted on the fragment of black cloth and without uttering a word without taking his eyes from that fragment he retreated to the wall and fumbled with his right hand along the wall for a key which was in the lock if a cupboard near the chimney
he found the key opened the cupboard plunged his arm into it without looking and without his frightened gaze quitting the tag which the barrier still held our spread
but the barrier continued monsieur le baron i have the strongest of reasons for believing that the assassinated young man was an opulent stranger lured into a trap by jean valjean and the bearer of an enormous sum of money
the young man was myself and here is the cost
cried marius and he flung upon the floor an old black coat all covered with blood
then snatching the fragment from the hands of the hardier he crouched down over the cost and laid the torn morsel against the tattered skirt
the rent fitted exactly and the strip completed the cost
the barrier was petrified
this is what he thought i'm struck all of a heap
marius rose to his feet trembling despairing radiant
he fumbled in his pocket and stalked furiously to the barrier presenting to him and almost thrusting in his face his fist filled with bank notes for five hundred and a thousand francs
you are an infamous wretch
you are a liar as alumni at or a villain
you came to accuse that man you have only justified him you wanted to ruin him you have only succeeded in glorifying him
and it is you who are the thief
and it is you who are the assassin
i saw you the barrier jon free rein that laid on the rue del' hopital
i know enough about you to send you to the valleys and even further if i choose
here are a thousand francs bully that you are
and he flung arnoux and franc more at the barrier
ah
jon dee the then at diff file rascal
let this serve you as a lesson you dealer in second hand secrets merchant if mysteries rummage for the shadows wretch
take these five hundred francs and get out of here
waterloo protects you
waterloo
growled the barrier pocketing the five hundred francs along with the thousand
yes assassin
you there saved the life of a colonel
of a general said the barrier elevating his head
of a colonel
repeated marius in a rage
iwouldn't give at a' penny for a general
and you come here to commit in damier
i tell you that you have committed all crimes
go
disappear
only be happy that is all that i desire
ah
monster
here are three thousand francs more
take them
you will depart tomorrow for america with your daughter for your wife is dead you abominable list
i shall watch over your departure you ruffian and at that moment i will count out to you twenty thousand francs
go get yourself hung elsewhere
monsieur le baron
replied the barrier bowing to the very earth eternal gratitude
and the hardier left the room understanding nothing stupefied and delighted with this sweet crushing beneath sacks of gold and with that thunder which had burst forth over his head in bank bills
struck by lightning he was but he was also content and he would have been greatly angered had he has a lightning rod to ward off such lightning as that
let us finish with this man at once
two days after the events which we are at this moment narrating he set out thanks to marius' care for america under a false name with his daughters selma furnished with a draft on new york for twenty thousand francs
the moral wretchedness of the hardier the bourgeois who had missed his vocation was irremediable
he was in america what he had been in europe
contact with an evil man sometimes suffices to corrupt a good action and to cause evil things to spring from it
with marius' money the barrier set up as a slave dealer
as soon as the hardier had left the house marius rushed to the garden where cosette was still walking
cosette
cosette
he cried
come
some quick
let us to
basque a carriage
cosette come
ah
my god
it was he who saved my life
let us not lose a minute
put on your shawl
cosette thought him mad and obeyed
he could not breathe he laid his hand on his heart to restrain it's throbbing
he paced back and forth with huge strides he embraced cosette am
cosette
i am an unhappy wretch
said he
marius was bewildered
he began to catch a glimpse in jean valjean of some indescribably lofty and melancholy figure
an unheard of virtue supreme and sweet humble in its immensity appeared to him
the convict was transfigured into christ
marius was dazzled by this prodigy
he did not know precisely what he beheld but it was grand
in an instant a hackney carriage stood in front of the door
marius helped cosette in and darted in himself
driver said he rue del' homme arms number
the carriage drove off
ah
what happiness
ejaculated cosette
rue del' homme arms i did not dare to speak to you if that
we are going to seek
jean
thy father
cosette thy father more than ever
cosette i guess it
you told me that you had never receives the letter that i sent you buy abroche
it must have fallen into his hands
cosette he went to the barricade to save me
as it is a necessity with him to be an angel he saved in here also be saved javert
he rescued me from that gulf to give me to you
he carried me on his back through that frightful sewer
ah
i am a monster of ingratitude
cosette after having been your providence he became mine
just imagine there was a terrible quagmire enough to drown one a hundred times over to drowning in more
cosette
he made me traverse it
i was unconscious i saw nothing i heard nothing i could know nothing of my own adventure
we are going to bring him back to take him with us whether he is woo ping or not he shall never leave us again
if only he is at home
provided only that we can find him i will pass the rest of my life in generating him
yes that is how it should be so you see cosette
gav roche must have delivered my letter to him
all is explained
you understand
cosette did not understand a word
you are right she said to him
meanwhile the carriage rolled on
chapter va night behind which there is day jean valjean turned round at the knock which he heard on his door
come in. he said feebly
the door opened
cosette and marius made their appearance
cosette rushed into the room
marius remained on the threshold leaning against the jamb of the door
cosette
said jean valjean
and has a terest in his chair his arms outstretched and trembling haggard livid gloomy an immense joy in his eyes
cosette sticking with emotion fell upon jean valjean's breast
father
said she
jean valjean overcome stammered cosette
she
you
madame
it is thou
ah
my god
and pressed close in cosette's arms he exclaimed it is thou
thou art here
thou dost pardon me they
marius lowering his eyelids in order to keep his tears from flowing took a step forward and murmured between oils convulsively contracted to repress his son's my father
and you also you pardon me
jean valjean said to him
marius could find no words and jean valjean added thanks
cosette tore off her shawl and tossed her hat on the bed
it embarrassed he said she
and seating herself on the old man's knees she put aside his white locks with an adorable movement and kissed his brow
jean valjean bewildered letter have her own way
cosette who only understood in a very confused manner redoubled her caresses as though she desired to pay marius' debt
jean valjean stammered how stupid people are
i thought that i should never see her again
imagine monsieur pont mercy at the very moment when you entered i was saying to myself' all is over
here is her little town i am a miserable man i shall never see cosette again' and i was saying that at the very moment when you were mounting the stairs
was not jan idiot
just see how idiotic one can be
one reckons without the good god
the good god says' you fancy that you are about to be abandon as stupid
no
no things will not go so
come there is a good many order whois in need of an angel
' and the angel comes and one sees one's cosette again
and one sees one's little cosette once more
ah
i was very unhappy
for a moment he could not speak then he went on i really new dec. to see cosette a little bit now and then
a heart needs a bone to gnaw
but i was perfectly sons cooks that i was in the way
i gave myself reasons' they do not want you keep in your own course one has not the right to cling eternally
' ah
god be praised i see her once more
dost thou know cosette thy husband is very handsome
ah
what a pretty embroidered collar thou hast on luckily
i am fond of that is green
it was thy husband who chose it was it not
and then thou shouldst have some cashmere shawl s
let me call meet you monsieur long mercy
it will not be dorling
and cosette began again how wicked of you to have left us like that
where did you go
why have you stayed away so long
format it your journey's only lasted three or four days
i sent nicolette the answer always was' he is absent
' how long have you been back
why did you not let us know
do you know that you are very much changed
ah
what a naughty father
he has been ill and we have not known it
stay marius feel how cold his hand is
so you are here
monsieur pont mercy you pardon me
repeated jean valjean
at that word which jean valjean has just uttered once more all that was swelling marius' heart found vent
he burst forth rosette do you hear
he has come to that
he asks my forgiveness
and do you know what he has done for me cosette
he has saved my life
he has done more he has given you to me
and after having saved me and after having given you to me cosette what has he done with himself
he has sacrificed himself
behold the man
and he says rome the ingrate to me the forgetful to me the pitiless to me the guilty one thanks
cosette my whole life passed at the feet of this man would be too little
that barricade that sewer that furnace that cesspool all that he traversed for me for thee cosette
he carried me a way through all the deaths which he put aside before me and accepted for himself
every courage every virtue every heroism every sanctity he possesses
cosette that man is an angel
bush
bush
said jean valjean in a low voice
why tell all that
but you
cried marius with a wrath in which there was generation why did you not tell it to me
it is your own fault top
you save people's lives and you conceal it from them
you do more under the pretext of unmasking yourself to us alumni are yourself
it is frightful
i told the truth replied jean valjean
no retorted marius the truth is the whole truth and that you did not tell
you were monsieur madeleine why not have said so
you saved javert why not have said so
lower my life to you why not have said so
because i thought as you do
i thought that you were in the right
it was necessary that i should go away
if you had known about that afraid of the sewer you would have made me remain near you
i was therefore forced to hold my peace
if i had spoken it would have caused embarrassment in every day
it would have embarrassed chat
embarrassed whom
retorted marius
do you think that you are going to stay here
we shall carry you off
ah
good heavens
when i reflect that it was by an accident that i have learned all this
you forms part of ourselves
you are her father and mine
you shall not pass another day in this dreadful house
do not imagine that you will be here tomorrow
tomorrow said jean valjean i shall not be here but i shall not be with you
what do you mean
replies marius
ah
come now we are not going to permit any more journeys
you shall never leave us again
you belong to us
we shall not loose our hold of you
this time it is for good added cosette
we have a carriage at the door
i shall run away with you
if necessary i shall employ force
and she laughingly made a movement to lift the old man in her arms
your chamber still stands ready in our house she went on
if you only knew how pretty the garden is now
the azaleas are doing very well there
the walls are sander with rivers and there are tiny violet shells
you shall eat my strawberries
i water them myself
and no more' madame' no more' monsieur jean' we are living under a republic everybody says thoudon't they marius
the programme is changed
if you only knew father i have had a sorrow there was a robin red breast which had made her nest in a hole in the wall and a horrible c state her
my poor pretty little robin red breast which used to put her head out of her window and look at me
i cried over it
i should have liked to kill the cat
but now nobody cries any more
everybody laughs everybody is happy
you are going to come with us
how delighted grandfather will be
you shall have your plot in the garden you shall cultivate it and we shall see whether your strawberries are a stint as mine
and then i shall do everything that you wish and then you will obey me prettily
jean valjean listened to her without hearing her
he heard the music of her voice rather than the sense of her words one of those large tears which are the sombre pearls of the soul welled up slowly in his eyes
he murmured the proof that god is good is that she is here
father
said cosette
jean valjean continued it is quite true that it would be charming for us to live together
their trees are full of birds
i would walk with cosette
i did sweet to be among living people who bid each other' good day' who call to eachother in the garden
people see each other from early morning
we should each cultivate our own little corner
she would make me rather strawberries
i would make her father my roses
that would be charming
only
he paused and said gently it is a pity
the fear did not call it retreated and jean valjean replaced it with a smile
cosette took both the old man's hands in here
my god
said she your hands are still colder than before
are you ipl
do you suffer
i
no replies jean valjean
i am very well
only
he paused
only what
i am going to die presently
cosette and marius shuddered
to die
exclaimed marius
yes but that is nothing said jean valjean
he took breath smiled and resumed cosette thou wert talking to me to one of my little rob i need breast is dead
speak so that i may hear thy voice
marius gazed at the old man in amazement
cosette uttered a heartrending cry
father
my father
you will live
you are going to live
i insist upon your living do you hear
jean valjean raised his head towards her with adoration
oh
yes forbid me to die
who knows
perhaps i shall obey
i was on the verge of dying when you came
that stopped me it seemed to me that i was born again
you see full of strength and life cried marine
do you imagine that a person can die like this
you have had sorrow you shall have no more
it is is to ask your forgiveness and on my knees
you are going to live and to live with us and to live a long time
we take possession of you once more
there are two of us here who will henceforth have no other thought than your happiness
you see resumed code the all bathed in tears that marius says that you shall not die
jean valjean continued to smile
even if you were to take possession of me monsieur pont mercy would that make me other than i am
no god has thought like you and myself and he does not change his mind it is useful for me to go
death is a good arrangement
god knows better than we what we need
may you be happy may monsieur pont mercy have cosette may youth see the morning may there be around you my children lilacs and nightingales may your life be a beautiful sunny lawn may all the enchantments of heaven fill your souls and now let me who am good for nothing did it is certain that all this is right
come be reasonable nothing is possible now i am fully conscious that all is over
and then last night i drank that whole jug of water
how good thy husband is cosette
thou art much better off with him than with me
a noise became audible at the door
it was the doctor entering
good day and farewell doctor said jean valjean
here are my poor children
marius stepped up to the doctor
he addressed to him only this single word monsieur
but his manner of pronouncing it contained a complete question
the doctor replied to the question by an expressive glance
because things are not agreeable said jean valjean that is no reason for being in just towards god
a silence ensued
all breasts were oppressed
jean valjean turned to cosette
he began to gaze at her as though he wished to retain her features for eternity
in the depths of the shadow into which he had already descended ecstasy was still possible to him when gazing at cosette
the reflection of that sweet face lighted up his pale visage
the doctor felt of his pulse
st
it was you that he wanted
he murmured looking at cosette and marius
and bending down to marius' war he added in a very low voice too late
jean valjean surveyed the doctor and marius serenely almost without ceasing to gaze at cosette
these barely articulate words were heard to issue from his mouth it is nothing to die it is dreadful not to live
all at once he rose to his feet
there accesses of strength are sometimes the sign of the death agony
he walked with a firm step to the wall thrusting aside markus and the doctor who tried to help him detached from the wall a little copper crucifix which was suspended there and returned to his seat with all the freedom of movement of perfect health and said in a loud voice as he laid the crucifix on the table behold the great martyr
then his chest sank in his head wavered as though the intoxication of the tomb were seizing hold upon him
his hands which rested on his knees began to press their nails into the stuff of his trousers
cosette supported his shoulders and sobbed and tried to speak to him but could not
among the words mingled with that mournful saliva which accompanies years they distinguished words like the following father do not leave us
is it possible that we have found you only to lose you again
it might be said that agony writhes
it goes comes advances towards the sepulchre and returns towards life
there is groping in the action of dying
jean valjean rallied after this set is soon shook his brow as though to make the shadows fall away from it and became almost perfectly lucid once more
he took a role of cosette's sleeve and kissed it
he is coming back
doctor he is coming back cried marius
you are good both of you said jean valjean
i am going to tell you what has caused me pain
what has pained me monsieur pont mercy is that you have not been willing to touch that money
that money really belongs to your fire
i will explain to young children and for that reason also i am glad to see you
black jet comes from england white jet comes from norway
all this is in this paper which you will read
for bracelets i invented a way of substituting for slides of soldered sheet iron slides of iron paid together
it is prettier better and less costly
you will under stand how much money can be made in that way
so cosette's fortune is really here
i give you these details in order that your mind may be set at best
the port read had come upstairs and was gazing in at the half open door
the doctor dismissed her
but he could not prevent this zealous woman from exclaiming to the dying man before she disappeared would you like a priest
i have had one replied jean valjean
and with his finger he seemed to indicate a point above his head where one would have said that he saw someone
it is probable in fact that the bishop was present at this death agony
cosette gently slipped a pillow under his loins
jean valjean resumed have no fear monsieur pint mercy i admire you
the six hundred thousand francs really belong to cosette
my life will have been wasted if you do not enjoy them
we managed to do very well with those glass goods
we rivalled what is called berlin jewellery
however we could not equal the black glass of england
a gross which contains twelve hundred very well but grains only costs three france
when a being who is dear to us is on the point of death we gaze upon him with a look which clings convulsively to him and which would fain hold him back
cosette gave her hand to marius and both mute with anguish not knowing what to say to the dying man stood trembling and despairing before him
jean valjean sank moment by moment
he was failing he was drawing near to the gloomy horizon
his breath had become intermittent a little rattling interrupted or
he found some difficulty in moving his forearm his feet had lost all movement and in proportion as the wretchedness of limb and feebleness of body increased all the majesty of his soul was displayed and spread over his brow
the light of the unknown world was already visible in his eyes
his face paper and smiled
life was no longer there it was something else
his breath sank his glance grew grander
he was a corpse on which the wings could be felt
he made a sign to cosette to draw near the bto marine the last minute of the last hour had evidently arrived
he began to speak to them in a voice so feeble that it seemed to come from a distance and one would have said that a wall now rose between them and him
draw near draw near both of you
i love you dearly
oh
how good it is to dislike this
and thou lovest he also my cosette
i knew well that thou still felt friendly towards guy poor old man
how kind it was of thee to place that pillow under my loins
thou wilt weep for me a little wilt thou not
not too much
i do not wish thee to have any real briefs
you must enjoy yourselves a great deal my children
i forgot to tell you that the profit was greater still on the buckles without tongues than on all the rest
a gross of a dozen dozens cost ten france and sold for sixty
it really was a good business
so there is no occasion for surprise at the six hundred thousand francs monsieur pont mercy
it is honest money
you may be rich with a tranquil mind
thou must have a carriage a box at the theatre snps and then and handsome ball dresses my cosette and then thou must give good dinners to thy friends and be very happy
i was writing to cosette awhile ago
she will find by letter
i bequeath to her the two candlesticks which stand on the chimney piece
they are of silver but to me they are told they are diamonds they change candles which are placed in them into wax tapers
i do not know whether the person who gave them to me is pleased with me yonder on high
i have done what i could
my children you will not forget that i am a poor man you will have me buried in the first plot of earth that you find under a stone to mark the spot
this is my wish
no name on the stone
if cosette cared to come for a little while now and then it will give me pleasure
and you too monsieur pont mercy
i must admit that i have not always loved you
i ask your pardon for that
now she and you form but one for me
i feel very grateful to you
i am sure that you make cosette happy
if you only knew monsieur long mercy her pretty rosy cheeks were my delight when i saw her in the least pale i was sad
in the chest of drawers there is a bank bill for five hundred francs
i have not touched it
it is for the poor
cosette dost thou see thy little town yonder on the bsd
dost thou recognize it
that was ten years ago however
how time flies
we have been very happy
all is over
do not weep my children i am not going very far i shall see you from there you will only have to look at night and you will see me smile
cosette dost thou remember mont vermeil
thou wert in the forest thou wert greatly terrified dost thou remember how i took hold of the handle of the water bucket
that was the first time that i touched thy poor little hand
it was so cold
ah
your hands were ref then mademoiselle they are very white now
and the big doll
dost thou remember
thou didst call her catherine
thou regretted est not having taken her to the convent
how thou didst make me laugh sometimes my sweet angel
when it had been raining thou didst float bits of straw on the gutters and watch them pass away
one day i gave thee a willow battleford and a shuttlecock with yellow blue and green feathers
thou hast forgotten it
thou wert roguish so young
thou didst play
thou didst put cherries in th years
those are things of the past
the forests through which one has passed with one's child the trees under which one has strolled the convents where one has concealed oneself the games the hearty laugh's of childhood and shadows
i imagined that all that belonged to me
in that lay my stupidity
those the barriers were wicked
thou must forgive them
cosette the moment has come to tell thee the name of thy mother
she was called fab time
remember that name can find
intel whenever thou uttered tut
she suffered much
she loved these early
she had as much unhappiness as thou hast had happiness
that is the way to cap portions things
he is the reign of the sees us all and he knows what he does in the midst of his great stars
i am on the verge of departure my children
love each other sell and always
there is nothing else but that in the world love for each other
you will think sometimes of the poor old man who died here
oh my cosette it is not my fault indeed that i have not seen the wall this time it cut me to the heart i went as far as the corner of the street i must have produced a queer effect of the people who saw me pass i was like a madman i once went out without my hat
i no longer see clearly my children i had still other things to say but never mind
think a little of me
come still heater
i die happy
give me your fear and well beloved heads so that i may lay my hands upon them
cosette and marius fell on their knees in despair suffocating with tears each beneath one of jean valjean's hands
those august hands no longer moves
he had fallen backwards the light of the candles illuminated him
his white face looked up to heaven he allowed cosette and marius to cover his hands with kisses
he was dead
the night was starless and extremely dark
no doubt in the gloom some immense angel stood erect with wings outspread awaiting that soul
illustration darkness b darkness chapter vi the grass covers and the rainer faces in the cemetery of pere lachaise in the vicinity of the common grace far from the elegant quarter of that city of sepulchres far from all the tombs of fancy which display in the presence of eternity all the hideous fashions of death in a deserted corner beside an old wall beneath a great yew tree over which climbs the wild convolvulus amid dandelions and misses the relies a stone

letter to m
daelli publisher of the italian translation of les miserables in milan
haute ville house october
you are rights of when you tell me that les miserables is written for all nations
i do not know whether it will be read by all but i wrote it for all
it is addressed to england as well as to spain to italy as well as to france to germany as well as to ireland to republics which have slaves as well as to empires which have serfs
social problems over step frontiers
the sides of the human race those great sites which cover the globe do not halt at the recor blue lines traced upon the map
in every place where man is ignorant and despairing in every place where woman is sold for bread wherever the child suffers for lack of the book which should instruct him and of the hearth which should warn him the book of les miserables knocks at the door and says open to jeu come for you
at the hour of civilization through which we are now passing and which is still so somber the miserable's name is man he is agonizing in all climes and he is groaning in all languages
your italy is no more exempt from the evil than is our france
your admirable italy has all miseries on the face of it
does not bandit is it may rating form of pauperis m inhabit your mountains
few nations are more deeply eaten by that ulcer of convents which i have endeavored to fathom
in spite of your possessing rome milan naples palermo turin florence sienna pi samantha bologna ferrara genoa venice a heroic history sublime ruins magnificen bruins and superb cities you are like ourselves poor
you are covered with marvels and vermin
assuredly the sum of italy is splendid but alas azure in the sky does not prevent rags on man
like us you have prejudices superstitions tyrannies fanaticism's blind law spending a ssistance to ignorant customs
you taste nothing of the present nor of the future without a flavor of the past being mingled with it
you have a barbarian the monk and a savage the lazzaro be
the social question is the same for you as for us
there are a few less deaths from hunger with you and a few more from fever your social hygiene is not much better than ours shadows which are protestant in england are catholic in italy but under different names the vasco do is identical with the bishop and it always means night and of pretty nearly the same quality
to explain the bible badly amounts to the same thing as to understand the gospel badly
is it necessary to emphasize this
just this melancholy parallelism be yet more completely verified
have you not indigent persons
glance below
have you got parasites
glance up
does not that hideous balance whose two scales pauperis hand parasitism so mournfully preserve their mutual equilibrium oscillate before you as it does before us
where is your army of schoolmasters the only army which civilization acknowledges
where are your free and compulsory schools
does everyone know how to read in the land of dante and of michael angelo
have you made public schools of your barracks
have you not like ourselves an opulent war budget and a paltry budget of education
have not you also that passive obedience which is so easily converted into soldierly obedience
military establishment which pushes the regulations to the extreme of firing up on garibaldi that is to say upon the living honor of italy
let us subject your social order to examination let us take it where it stands and as it stands let us view it's flagrant offences show me the woman and the child
it is by the amount of protection with which these two feeble creatures are surrounded that the degree of civilization is to be measured
is prostitution less heartrending in naples than in paris
what is the amount of truth that springs from your laws and what amount of justice springs from your tribunals
do you chance to be so fortunate as to be ignorant of the meaning of those gloomy words public prosecution legal infamy or is on the scaffold the executioner the death penalty
italians with you as with us beccaria is dead and far i have is alive
and then let us scrutinize your state reasons
have you a government which comprehends the identity of morality and politics
you have reached the point where you grant amnesty to heroes
something very similar has been done in france
stay let us pass miseries in review let each one contribute his pipe you are as to chasse
have you not like ourselves two condemnations religious condemnation pronounced by the priest and social condemnation decreed by the judge
oh great nation of italy thou resemble at the great nation of france
alas
our brothers you are like ourselves miserables
from the depths of the gloom wherein you dwell you do not see much more distinctly than we the radiant and distant portals of eden
only the priests are mistaken
these holy portals are before and not behind us
i resume
this book les miserables is no less your mirror than ours
certain men certain castes rise in revolt against this book i understand that
mirrors those revealed's of the truth are hated that does not prevent them from being of use
as for myself i have written for all with a profound love for my own country but without being engrossed by france more than by any other nation
in proportion as i advance in life i grow more simple and i become more and more patriotic for humanity
this is more over the tendency of our age and the law of radiance of the french revolution books must cease to be exclusively french italian german spanish or english and become european i say more human if they are to correspond to the enlargement of civilization
hence a new logic of art and of certain requirements of composition which modify everything even the conditions formerly narrow of taste and language which must grow broader like all the rest
in france certain critics have reproached me to my great delight with having transgressed the bounds of what they call french taste i should be glad if this full glum were merited
in short i am doing what i can i suffer with the same universal suffering and i try to assuage if i possess only the puny forces of a man and i cry to all help me
this sir is what your letter prompts me to say i say it for you and for your country
if i have insisted so strongly it is because of one phrase in your letter
you write there are italians and they are numerous who say' this book les miserables is a french book
it does not concern us
let the f gency read it as a history we read it as a romance
' alas
i repeat whether we be italians of frenchmen misery concerns us all
ever since history has been written ever since philosophy has meditated misery has been the garment of the human race the moment has an length arrived for tearing off that rag and for replacing upon the naked limbs of the man people the sinister fragment of the past with the grand purple robe of the dawn
if this letter seems to you of service in enlightening some minds and in dissipating some prejudices you are at liberty to publish its ir
accept i pray you a renewed assurance of my very distinguished sentiments

left munich atp
m
inst may arriving at vienna early next morning should have arrived at but train was an hour late
budapest h seems a wonderful place from the glimpse which it profit from the train and the little i could walk through the streets
i feared to go very far from the station as we had arrived late and would start as near the correct time as possible
the impression i had was that we were leaving the west and entering the east the most western of splendid bridges over the danube which is here if noble width and depth took us among the traditions of turkish rule
we left in pretty good time and came after by the call toll queen burgh
here i stopped for the night at the hotel royale
i had for dinner or rather supper a chicken done up some way with red pepper which was very good but thirsty
men
get recipe for nina
i asked the waiter and he said it was called paprika tend land that as it was a national wish i should be able to get it anywhere along the carpathians
i found my smattering of german very useful here indeed idon't know how i should be able to get on without it
having had some time at my disposal when in london i had visited the british museum and made search among the books and maps in the library regarding transylvania it had struck me that some foreknowledge of the country could hardly fail to have some importance in dealing with a nobleman of that country
i find that the district he named is in the extreme each of the country just on the borders of three stages transylvania moldavia and bukovina in the midst of the carpathian mountains one of the wildest and least known portions of europe
i was not able to light on any map of work giving the exact locality of the castle dracula as there are no maps of this country as yet to compare with our own ordnance survey maps but i found that bistrita the post town named by count dracula is a fairly well known place
i shall enter here some of my notes as they may refresh my memory when it all over my travels with mina
in the population of transylvania there are four distinct nationalities saxons in the south and mixed with them the wallach's who are the descendants of the back and many are in the west and szekely's in the east and north
i am going among the latter who claim to be descended from attila and the huns
this may be so for when the magyars conquered the country in the eleventh century they found the huns settled on it
i read that every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the centre of some sort of imaginative whirlpool if so my stay may be very interesting
men
i must ask the count all about them
i did not sleep well though my bed was comfortable enough for i had all sorts of a user dreams
there was a dog howling all night under my window which may have had something to do with it or it may have been the paprika for i had to drink up all the water in my carafe and was still thirsty
towards morning i slept and was wakened by the continuous knocking at my door so i guess i must have been sleeping soundly then
i had for breakfast more paprika and a sort of porridge of maize flour which they said was mama liga and eggplant stuffed with forcemeats very excellent dish which they call imple tags
men
get recipe for this also
i had to hurry breakfast for the brain started a little before eight or rather it ought to have done so for after rushing to the station at i had to sit in the carriage for more than an hour before we began to move
it seems to me that the further east you to the more in punctual are the trains
what ought they to be in china
all day long we seemed to dawdle through a country which was full of beauty of every kind
sometimes we saw little towns or castles on the top of steep hills such as we see in ole miss a is sometimes we randy rogers and streams which seemed from the sides tony martin on each side of them to be subject to great floors
it takes a lot of water and running strong to sweep the outside edge of a river clear
at every station there were groups of people sometimes crowds and in all sorts of attire
some of them were just ok of the peasants at home or those i saw coming through france and germany with short jackets and round hats and homemade trousers but others were very picturesque
the women looked pretty except when you got near them but they were very clumsy about the waist
they had all full white sleeves of some kind or other and most of them had big belts with a lot of strips of something fluttering from them like the dresses in a ballet but of course there were petticoats under the j
the strangest figures we saw were the slovaks who were more barbarian than the rest with their big cowboy hats great baggy dirty white trousers white linen shirts and enormous heavy leather belts nearly a foot wide all stud decoder with brass nails
they wore high boots with their trousers tucked into them and had long black hair and heavy black moustaches
they are very picturesque but do not look pre possessing
on the stage they would be set down at once as some old oriental band of brigands
they are however i am told very harmless and rather wanting in natural self assertion
it was on the dark side of twilight when we got to bistrita which is a very interesting old place
being practically on the frontier for the borgo pass leads from it into bukovina it has had a very stormy existence and it certainly shows marks of it
fifty years ago a series of great fires took place which made terrible havoc on five separate occasions
at the very beginning of the seventeenth century it underwent a siege of three weeks and lost people the casualties of war proper being assisted by famine and disease
count dracula had directed me to go to the golden krone hotel which i found to my great delight to be thoroughly old fashioned for of course i wanted to see all i could of the ways of the country
i was evidently expected for when i got near the door i faced a cheery looking elderly woman in the usual peasant dress white undergarment with a long double akron front and back of coloured stuff fitting almost too tight for modesty
when it and closes he bowed and said the herd englishman
yes i said jonathan harker
she smiled and gave some message to an elderly man on white shirt sleeves who had followed her to the door
he went but immediately returned with a letter my friend
welcome to the carpathians
i am anxiously expecting you
sleep well tonight
at these tomorrow the diligence will start for bukovina a place on it is kept for you
at the borgo pass my carriage will await you and will bring you to me
i trust that your journey from london has been a happy one and that you will enjoy your stay in my beautiful land
your friend dracula
main found that my landlord had got a letter from the count directing him to secure the best place on the coach for me but on making inquiries as to detail she seemed somewhat reticent and pretended that he could not understand my german
this could not be true because upto then he had understood it perfectly at least he answered my questions exactly as if he did
he and his wife the old lady who had received he looked at each other in a frightened sort of way
he mumbled out that the money had been sent in a letter and that was all he knew
when i asked him if he knew count dracula and could tell me anything of his castle both he and his wife crossed themselves and saying that they knew nothing at all simply refused to speak further
it was so near the time of starting that i had no time to ask anyone else for it was all very mysterious and not by any means comforting
just before i was leaving the old lady came up to my room and said in a hysterical way must you go
oh
young here must you go
she was in such an excited state that she seemed to have lost her grip of what german she knew and mixed it all up with some other language which i did not know at all
i was just able to follow her by asking many questions
when i told her that i just go at once and that i was engaged on important business she asked again do you know what day it is
i answered that it was the fourth of man
she shook her head as she said again oh yes
i know that
i know that but do you know what day it is
on my saying that i did not understand she went on it is the eve of st
george's day
do you not know that tonight when the clock strikes midnight all the evil things in the world will have full swag
do you know where you are going and what you are going to
she was in such evident distress that i tried to comfort her but without effect
finally she went down on her knees and implored mr. not to go at least to wait a day or two before starting
it was a livery ridiculous but i did not feel comfortable
however there was business to be done and i could allow nothing to interfere with it
i tried to raise her up and said as gravely as i could that i thanked her but my duty was imperative and that i just go
she then rose and dried her eyes and taking a crucifix from her neck offered it to me
i did not know what to do for as an english church man i have been taught to regard such things as in some measure idolatrous and yet it seemed so ungracious to refuse an old lady meaning so well and in such a state of mind
she saw i suppose the doubt in my face for she put the rosary round my neck and said for your mother's sake and went out of the room
i am writing up this part of the diary whilst i am waiting for the coach which is of course late and the crucifix is still found my neck
whether it is the old lady's fear of the many ghostly traditions of this place of the crucifix itself i do not know but i am not feeling nearly as easy in my mind as usual
if this book should ever reach mins before i do let it bring my goodbye
here comes the coach
may
the castle
the gray of the morning has passed and the sun is high over the distant horizon which seems jagged whether with trees or hills i know not for it is so far off that big things and little are mixed
i am not sleepy and as i am not to be called till i awake naturally i write till sleep domed
there are many odd things to put down and lest who reads them may fancy that i dined too well before i left biarritz let me put down my dinner exactly
i dined on what they called robbers team bits of bacon onion and beef seasoned with red pepper and strung on sticks and roasted over the fire in the simple style of the london cat's meat
the wine was golden media sch which produces a sure rating on the tongue which is however not disagreeable
i had only a couple of glasses of this and nothing else
when i got on the coach the driver had not taken his seat and i saw him talking to the landlady
they were evidently talking of me for every now and then they looked at me and some of the people who were sitting on the bench outside the door came and listened and then looked at me most of them pitying ky
i could hear a lot of words often repeated queer words for there were many nationalities in the crowd so i quietly got my polyglot dictionary from my bag and looked them out
i must say they were not cheering time for amongst them were of dogs at snp pool halls trego is a witch droll landvik islam both mean the same thing one being slovak and the other serbian for something that is either werewolf or vampire
men
i must ask the count about these superstitions
when we started the crowd round the inn door which had by this time swelled to a considerable size all made the sign of the cross and pointed two fingers towards me
with some difficulty in its fellow passenger to tell me what they meant
he would not answer at first but on learning that i was english he explained that it was a charm or guard against the evil eye
this was not very pleasant for me just starting for an unknown place to meet an unknown man
but everyone seemed so kind hearted and so sorrowful and so sympathetic that i could not but he touched
i shall never forget the last glimpse which i had of their guard and its crowd of picturesque figures all crossing themselves as they stood round the wide archway with its background of rich foliage of oleander and orange trees in green tubs clustered in the centre of the yard
then our driver whose wife linen drawers covered the whole front of the box seat not as they call them cracked his big ship over his four small horses which ran a breast and we set off on our journey
i soon lost sight and recollection of ghostly fears in the beauty of the scene as we drove along although had i know j. the language or rather languages which my fellow passengers were speaking i might not have been able to throw them off so easily
before us lay a green sloping land full of forests and woods with here and there steep hills crowned with clumps of trees or with farmhouses the blank gable end to the road
there was everywhere a bewildering mass of fruit blossom apple plump fat cherry
and as we drove by i could see the green grass under the trees spangled with the fallen petals
in and out amongst these green hills of what they call heretic not tell and ran the road losing itself as it swept round the grassy curve or was shut out by the straggling ends of pine woods which here and there ran down the hillsides like tongues of flame
the road was rugged but still we seemed to fly over it with a feverish haste
i could not understand then what the taste meant but the driver was evidently benton losing no time in reaching for top fund
i was told that this road is in summertime excellent but that it had not yet been put in order after the winter snows
in this respect it is different from the general run of roads in the carpathians for it is an old tradition that they are not to be kept in too good order
i told the bowl award would not repair them lest the turk should think that they were preparing to bring in foreign troops and so hasten the war which was always really at loading point
beyond the green swelling hills of the mittel land rose mighty slopes of forest up to the lofty steels of the carpathians themselves
right and left of us they towered with the afternoon sun falling full upon them and bringing out all the glorious colours of this beautiful range deep blue and purple in the shadows of the peaks green and brown where grass and rock mingled and an endless perspective of jagged rock and pointed drag still these were themselves lost in the distance where the snowy peaks rose grandly
here and there seemed mighty rifts in the mountains through which as the sum began to sink we saw now and again the white gleam of falling water
one of my companions touched my arms see swept round the base of a hill and opened up the lofty snow covered peak of a mountain which seemed as we wound on our serpentine way to be right before us
look
is tens zek
god's seat
and he crossed himself reverently
as we wound on our endless way and the sun sank lower and lower behind us the shadows of the evening began to creep round us
this was emphasized by the fact that the snowy mountain top still held the sunset and seemed to flow out with a delicate cool link
here and there we passed case us and slovaks all in picturesque attire but i noticed that goitre was painfully prevalent
by the roadside were many crosses and as we swept by my companions all crossed themselves
here and there was a peasant manor woman kneeling before a shrine who did not even turn round as we approached but seemed in the self surrender of devotion to have neither eyes nor cars for the outer world
there were many things new home
for instance ha tricks in the trees and hard and there very beautiful masses of weeping birch their white stems shining like silver through the delicate green of the leaves
now and again we passed a leiter wagon the ordinary peasants' s cart with its long snake like vertebra calculated to suit the inequalities of the road
in this we're sure to be seated quite a group of homecoming peasants the case is with their white and the slovaks with their coloured sheepskins the latter carrying lance fashion their long stages with a seat end
as the evening tell it began to get very cold and the growing twilight seemed to merge into one dark his time as the gloom of the trees oak beech and pine though in the valleys which ran deep between the spurs of the hills as we ascended through the pass the dark fire stood out here and there against the background of late lying snow
sometimes as the road was cut through the pine woods that seemed in the darkness to be closing down upon us great masses of grey ness which here and there be strewed the trees produced a peculiarly weird and solemn effect which carried on the thoughts and geum fancies engendered earlier in the evening when the falling sunset threw into strange relief the ghost like clouds which amongst the carpathians seem to wind ceaselessly through the valleys
sometimes the hills were so steep that despite our driver's haste the horses could only go slowly
i wished to get down and walk up them as we do at home but the driver would not hear of it
no home said
you must not walk here
the dogs are too fierce
and that he added with what he evidently meant for grim pleasantry for he looked round to catch the approving smile of the rest and you may have enough of such matters before you go to sleep
the only stop he would make was a moment's pause to light hid lamps
when it grew dark there seemed to be some excitement amongst the passengers and they kept a pealing to him one after the other as though urging him to further speed
he lashed the horses unmercifully with his long whip and with wild cries of encouragement urged them into further exertions
then through the darkness i could see a sort of patch of grey light ahead of us as though there were a cleft in the hills
the excitement of the passengers grew greater
the crazy coach rocked on its great leather springs and swayed like a boat tossed on a stormy sea
i had to hold on
the road grew more level and we appeared to fly along
then the mountains seemed to come nearer to us on each side and to frown down upon us
we were entering on the borgo pass
one by one several of the passengers offered me gifts which they pressed upon me with an earnestness which would take no denial
these were certainly of an odd and varied kind but each was given in simple good faith with a kindly word and a blessing and that same strange mixture of fear meaning movements which i had seen outside the hotel at bistrita the sign of the cross and the guard against the evil eye
then as we flew among the driver leaned forward and on each side the passengers craning over the edge of the coach peered eagerly into the darkness
it was evident that something very exciting was either happening of expected but though i asked each passenger no one would give me the slightest explanation
this state of excitement kept on for some little time
and at last we saw before us the pass opening out on the eastern side
there were dark rolling clouds overhead and in the air the heavy oppressive sense of thunder
it seemed as though the mountain range had separated two atmospheres and that now we had got into the thunderous one
i was now myself looking out for the conveyance which was to take me to the count
each moment i expected to see the glare of lamps through the blackness but all was dark
the only light was the flickering days of our own lamps in which the steam from our hard drive n horses rose in a white cloud
we could see how the sandy road lying white before us but there was on it no sign of a vehicle
the passengers drew back with a sigh of gladness which seemed to mock my own disappointment
i was already thinking what i had best do when the driver looking at his watch said to the others something which i could hardly hear it was spoken so quietly and in soloway one i thought it was an hour less than the time
then turning to me he spoke in german worse than my own
there is no carriage here
the herd is not expected after all
he will now come into bukovina and return tomorrow or the next day better the next day
whilst he was speaking the horses began to neigh and short and plunge wildly do that the driver had to hold them up
then amongst a chorus of screams from the peasants and a universal crossing of themselves a caleche with four horses drove up behind us over took us and draw up beside the coach
i could see from the flash of our lamps as the rate fell on them that the horses were coal black and splendid animals
they were driven by a tall man with a long brown bears and a great black hat which seemed to hide his face from us
i could only see the gleam of a pair of very bright eyes which seemed red in the lamplight as he turned to us
he said to the driver you are early tonight my friend
the man stammered in reply the english here was in a hurry
to which the stranger replied that is why i suppose you wished him to go into bukovina
you can not deceive me my friend
i know too much and my horses are swift
as he spoke he smiled and the lamp light fell on a hard looking mouth with very red lips and sharp looking teeth as white as ivory
one of my companions whispered to another the line from burger's lenore
wenn die for genre item schnell
for the dead travel east
the strange driver evidently heard the words for he looked up with a gleaming smile
the passenger turned his face away at the same time putting out his two fingers and crossing himself
give me the herr's luggage said the driver and with exceeding alacrity my bags were handed out and put in the caleche
then i descended from the side of the coach as the sales he was close alongside the driver helping me with a hand which caught my arm in a grip of steel
his strength must have been prodigious
without a word he shook his reins the horses turned and we swept into the darkness of the pass
as i looked back i saw the steam from the horses of the coach by the light of the lamps and projected against it the figures of my late companions crossing themselves
then the driver cracked his whip and called to his horses and off they swept on their way to bukovina
as they sank into the darkness i felt a strange chill and a lonely feeling come over me
but a cloak was thrown over my shoulders and a run across my knees and the driver said in excellent german the night is chill me in here and my master the count base metal wall care of you
there is a flask of sligo fits the plum branch of the country underneath the seat if you should require it
i did not take any but it was a comfort to know it was there all the same
i felt a little strangely and not a little frightened
i think had there been any alternative i should have taken it instead of prosecuting that unknown night journey
the carriage went ata hard pace straight along then we made a complete turn and went along another straight road
it seemed to me that we were simply going over and over the same ground again and so i took note of some salient point and found that this was so
i would have liked to have asked the driver what this all meant but i really feared to do so vor i thought that placed as i was any protest would have had no effect in case there had been an intention to delay
by and by however as i was curious to know how time was passing i struck a match and by its flame looked at my watch
it was within a few minutes of midnight
this gave me a sort of shock for i suppose the general superstition about midnight was increased by my recent experiences
i waited with a sick feeling of suspense
then a dog began to howl somewhere in a farmhouse far down the road along agonized sailing as it from fear
the sound was taken up by another dog and then another and another till borne on the wind which now signed softly through the pass a wild howling began which seemed to come from all over the country as far as the imagination could grasp it through the gloom of the night
at the first howl the horses began to strain and rear but the driver spoke to them soothingly and they quieted down but shivered and sweater as though after a run away from sudden fright
then far off in the distance from the mountains on each side of us began a louder and a sharper howling that of wolves which affected both the horses and myself in the same way
for i was no need to jump from the caleche and run whilst they feared again and plunged madly so that the driver had to use all his great strength to keep them from booting
in a few mini rss however my own ears not accustomed to the sound and the horses so far became quiet that the driver was able to descend and to stand before them
be petted and soothed them and whispered something in their ears as i have heard of horse gamers doing and with extraordinary effect for under his caresses they became quite manageable again though they still trembled
the driver again took his seat and shaking his reins started off at a great pace
this time after going to the far side of the pass he suddenly turned down a narrow roadway which ran sharply to the right
soon we were hemmed in with trees which in places arched right over the roadway till we passed as through a tunnel
and again great frowning rocks guarded us boldly on either side
though we were in shelter we could hear the rising wind for it moaned and whistled through the rocks and the branches of the trees crashed together as we swept along
it grew colder and folders hulk and fine powder us now began to talk so that sooner and all around us were covered with a white blanket
the keen wind still carried the howling of the dogs though this grew fainter as we went on our way
the gating of the wolves sounded nearer and bearer as though they were closing found on us from every side
i grew dreadfully afraid and the horses shared my fear
the driver however was not in the least disturbed
he kept turning his head to left and right but i could not see anything through the darkness
suddenly away on our left i saw a faint flickering blue flame
the driver saw it at the same moment
heat once checked the horses and jumping to the ground disappeared into the darkness
i did not know what to do the less as the howling of the wolves grew closer
but while i wondered the driver suddenly appeared again and without a word took his seat and we resumed our journey
i think i must have fallen asleep and kept dreaming of the incident for it seemed to be repeated endlessly and now looking back it is like a sort of awful nightmare
once the flame appeared so near the road that even in the darkness around us i could watch the driver's motions
he went rapidly to where the blue flame arose it must have been very faint for it did not seem to illumine the place around it at all and gathering a few stones formed them into some device
once there appeared a strange optical effect
when he stood between me and the flame he did not obstruct it for i could see it's ghostly flicker all the same
this startled me but as the effect was only momentary i took it that my eyes deceived me a training through the darkness
then for a time there were no blue flames and we sped onwards through the gloom with the howling of the wolves around us as though they were follow ing in a moving circle
at last there came a time when the driver went further afield than he had yet gone and during his absence the horses began to tremble worse than ever and to snort and scream with fright
i could not see any cause for it for the howling of the wolves had ceased altogether
but just then the moon sailing through the black clouds appeared behind the jagged crest of a best kingpins glad rock and by its light i saw around is a ring of wolves with white teeth and looking red tongues with long sinewy limbs and shaggy hair
they were a hundred times more terrible in the grim silence which held them than even when they howled
for myself i felt a sort of paralysis of fear
it is only when a man feels himself face to face with such horrors that he can understand their true import
all at once the wolves began to howl as though the moonlight had had some peculiar effect on them
the horses jumped about and reared and looked helplessly round with eyes that rolled in a way painful to see
but the living ring of terror encompassed them on every side and they had perforce to remain within it
i called to the coachman to come for it seemed to me that our only chance was to try to break out through the ring and to aid his approach i shouted and beat the side of the caleche hoping by the noise to scare the wolves from the side road to give him a chance of reaching the trap
how he came there i know not but i heard his voice raised in at one of imperious command and looking towards the sound saw him stand in the roadway
as he swept his long arms as though brushing aside some impalpable obstacle the wolves fell back and back further still
just then a heavy cloud passed across the face of the moon so that we were again in darkness
when i could see again the driver was climbing into the caleche and the wolves disappeared
this was all so strange and uncanny that a dreadful fear came upon me and i was afraid to speak or move
the time seemed interminable as we swept on our way now in almost complete darkness for the rolling clouds obscured the moon
we kept in ascending with occasional periods of quick descent but in the main always ascending
suddenly i became conscious of the fact that the driver was in the act of pulling up the horses in the courtyard of a vast ruined castle from whose tall black windows came norah of light and whose broken battlements showed a jagged line against the sky
chapter jonathan harker's journal continued may
i must have been asleep for certainly if i had been fully awake i must have noticed the approach of such a remarkable place
in the gloom the courtyard looked of considerable size and as several dark days led from it under great round arches it perhaps seemed bigger than it really is
i have not yet been able to see it by daylight
when the sales he stopped the driver jumped down and held out his hand to assist me to a light
again i could not but notice his prodigious strength
his hand actually seemed like a steel vice that could have crushed mine if he had chosen
then he took my traps and placed them on the ground beside me as i stood close to a great door old and studded with large iron nails and set in a projecting doorway of massive stone
i could see even in the dim light that the stone was massively carved but that the carving had been much worn by time and weather
as i stood the driver jumped again into his seat and shook the reins
the horses started forward and trap and all disappeared down one of the dark openings
i stood in silence where i was for i did not know what to do
of bell or knocked there was no sign
through these frowning walls and dark window openings it was not likely that my voice could penetrate
the time i waited seemed endless and i felt doubts and tears crowding upon me
what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people
what sort of grim adventure was it on which i had embarked
was this a customary incident in the life of a so pick for's clerk sent out to explain the purchase of a london estate to a foreigner
solicitor's clerk
mina would not like that
solicitor for just before leaving london i got word that my exam o nation was successful and i am now a full blown solicitor
i began to rub my eyes and pinch myself to see if i were awake
it all seemed like a horrible nightmare home and i expected that i should suddenly awake and find myself at home with the dawn struggling in through the windows as i had now and again felt in the morning after a day of overwork
but my flesh answered the pinching test and my eyes were not to be deceived
i was indeed awake and among the carpathians
all i could do now was to be patient and to wait the coming of morning
just as i had come to this conclusion i heard a heavy step approaching behind the great door and saw through the chinks the gleam of a coming light
then there was the sound of rattling chains and the flanking of massive bolts drawn back
a key was turned with the loud grating noise of long disuse and the great door swung back
within stood at all open an clean shaven save for a long white moustache and clad in black from head to boot without a single speck of colour about him anywhere
he held in his hand an antique silver lamp in which the flame burned without a chimney or globe of any kind throwing kong quivering shadows as it flickered in the draught of the open door
the old man motioned me in with his right hand with a courtly gesture saying in excellent english but with a strange intonation
welcome to my house
enter freely and of your own free will
he made no motion of stepping to meet me but stood like a statue as though his gesture of welcome had fixed him into stone
the instant however that i had stepped over the threshold he moved impulsively forward and holding out his hand grasped mine with a strength which made me since an effect which was not lessened by the fact that it seemed cold as ice more like the hand of a dead than a living man
again he said welcome to my house
enter freely
go safely and leave something of the happiness you bring
the strength of the handshake was so much akin to that which i had noticed in the driver whose face i had not seem that for a moment i doubted if it were not the same person to whom i was speaking
so to make sure i said interrogative it count dracula
he bowed in a courtly way as he replied i am dracula and ibid you welcome mr.
marker to my house
come in the night air is chill and you must need to eat and rest
as he was speaking he put the lamp on a bracket on the wall and stepping out took my luggage
he had carried it in before i could forestall him
i protested but he insisted
nays if you are my guest
it is late and my people are not available
let me set to your comfort myself
he insisted on carry on gmt traps along the passage and then up a great winding stair and along another great passage on whose stone floor our steps rang heavily
at the end of this he threw open a heavy door and i rejoiced to see within a well lit room in which a table was spread for supper and on whose mighty hearth a great fire of logs freshly replenished flames and flared
the county alter putting down my bags closed the door and crossing the room opened another door which led into a small octagonal room lit by a single lamp and seemingly without a window of any soft
passing through this he opened another door and motioned me to enter
it was a welcome sight
go there was a great bedroom well lighted and warmed with another log fire also added to buy lately for the top logs were fresh which sent a hollow road to the wide chimney
the count himself left my luggage inside and withdrew saying before he closed the door
you will need after your journey to refresh yourself by making your toilet
i trust you will find all you wish
when you are ready come into the other room where you will find your supper prepared
the light and warmth and the count's courteous welcome seemed to have dissipated all my doubts and fears
having then reached my normal state i discovered that i was half famished with hunger
so making a hasty toilet i went into the other room
i found supper already laid out
my host who stood in one side of the great fireplace leaning against the stonework made a graceful edge of his hand to the table and said i pray you be seated and sup how you please
you will i trust excuse me that i do not going ok but i have dined already and i do not sup
i handed to him the sealed letter which mr.
hawkins had entrusted to me
he opened it and read it gravely
then with a charming smile he handed it time to read
one passage of it at least gave me a thrill of pleasure
i must regret that an attack of gout from which malady i am a constant suffered for bids absolutely any travelling on my part for some time to come
but i am happy to say i can send a sufficient substitute one in whom i have every possible confidence
he is a young man full of energy and talent in his own way and of a very faithful disposition
he is discreet and silent and has grown into manhood in my service
he shall be ready to attend on you when you will during his stay and shall take your instructions in all matters
the count himself came forward and took off the cover of a fish and i fell to at once on an excellent roast chicken
this with some cheese and a salad and a bottle of old tokay of which i had two glasses was my supper
during the time i was eating it the count asked me many questions as to my journey and i told him by degrees all i had experienced
by this time i had finished my supper and by my host's desire had drawn up a chair by the fire and begun to smoke a cigar which he offered me at the same time excusing himself that he did not smoke
i had now an opportunity of observing him and found him of a very marked physiognomy
his face was a strong a very strong aquiline with high bridge of the thin nose and peculiarly arched nostrils with lofty domed forehead and hair growing scantily round the temples but profusely elsewhere
his eyebrows were very massive almost meeting over the nose and with busty hair that seemed to go to in its own profusion
the mouth so far as i could see it under the heavy moustache was fixed and rather cruel looking with peculiarly sharp white teeth
these protruded over the lips whose remarkable giddiness shower astonishing vitality in a man of his years
for the rest his ears were pale and at the tips extremely pointed
the chin was broad and strong and the cheeks firm thought him
the general effect was one of extraordinary pallor
hitherto i had noticed the backs of his hands as they lay on his knees in the firelight and they had seemed rather white and fine
but seeing them now close to me i could not but notice that they were rather coarse broad with squat fingers
strange to say there were hairs in the centre of the palm
the nails were long and fine and cut to a sharp point
as the count leaned over me and his hands touched me i could not repress a shudder
it may have been that his breath was rank but a horrible feeling of nausea came over me which do what i would i could not conceal
the count evidently noticing it drew back
and with a grim sort of smile which showed more than he had yet done his pro gruber any teeth sat himself down again on his own side of the fireplace
we were both silent for awhile and as i looked towards the window i saw the first win streak of the coming dawn
there seemed a strange stillness over everything
but as i listened i heard as it from down below in the valley the howling of many wolves
the count's eyes gleamed and he said
listen to them the children of the night
what music they make
seeing i suppose some expression in my face strange to him he added and if you dwellers in the city can not enter into the feelings of the hunter
then he rise and said
but you must be tired
your bedroom is allready and tomorrow you shall sleep as late as you will
i have to be away till the afternoon so sleep well and dream well
with a courteous how he opened for me himself the door to the octagonal room and i entered my bedroom
i am all in a sea of wonders
i doubt
i fear
i think strange things which i dare not confess to my own soul
god keep me if only for the sake of those wear home
may
it is again early morning but i have rested and enjoyed the last twenty four hours
i slept till late in the day and awoke of my own accord
when i had dressed myself i went into the room where we had supper and found a cold breakfast laid out with coffee kept hit by the pot being placed on the hearth
there was a card on the table on which was written i have to be absent for awhile
do not wait for me
d
i set to and enjoyed a hearty meal
when i had done i looked for a bell so that i might let the servants know i had finished but i could not find one
there are certainly odd deficiencies in the house considering the extraordinary evidences of wealth which are found me
the table service is of gold and so beautifully drought that it must be of immense value
the curtains and upholstery of the stairs and sofas and the hangings of my bed age of the costliest and most beautiful fabrics and must have been if fabulous value when they were made for they are centuries old though in excellent order
i saw something like them in hampton court but they were worn and frayed and not beaten
but still in none of the rooms is there a mirror
there is not even a toilet glass on my table and i had to get the little shaving glass from my bag before i could either shave or brush my hair
i have not yet seen a servant anywhere or heard a sound near the castle except the mid pint of wolves
sometime after i had finished my meal i do not know whether to call it breakfast or dinner for it was between five and sixo'clock when i had it i looked about for something to read for i did not like to go about the castle until i had asked the count's permission
there was absolutely nothing in the room book newspaper or even writing materials so i opened another door in the room and found a sort of library
the door opposite mine i tried but found locked
in the library i found to my great delight a vast number of english books whole shelves full of them and bound volumes of magazines and newspapers
a table in the centre was littered with english magazines and newspapers though none of them were of very recent date
the books were of the most varied kind history geography politics political economy botany geology lawall relating to england and english life and customs and manners
there were even such books of reference as the london directory the red and blue books whitaker's almanac the army and navy lists and it somehow gladdened my heart to see if the law list
whilst i was looking at the books the door opened and the count entered
he saluted me in a hearty way and hoped that i had had a good night's rest
then he went on
i am glad you found your way in here for i am sure there is much that will interest you
these compan jobs and he laid his hand on some of the books have been good friends tome and for some years past ever since i had the idea of going to london have given me many many hours of pleasure
through them i have come to know your great england and to know her is to love her
i long to go through the crowded streets of your mighty london to be in the midst of the whirl and rush of humanity to share it's life it's change its death and all that makes it what it is
but alas
as yet i only know your tongue through books
to you my friend i look that i know it to speak
but counties if you know and speak english thoroughly
he bowed gravely
i thank you my friend for your all too flattering estimate but yet i fear that i am but a little way on the road i would travel
true i know the grammar and the words but yet i know not how to speak them
indeed i said you speak excellently
not so he answered
well i know that did i move and speaking out london none there are who would not know me for a stranger
that is not enough for me
here i am noble
i am a bihar
the common people know me and i am master
but a stranger in a strange land he is no one
men know him nor and to know not is to care not for
i am content if i am like the rest so that no man stops if he sees me or pauses in his speaking if he hears my words' ha ha
a stranger
' i have been so long master that i would be master still or at least that none other should be master of me
you come to me not alone as agent of my friend peter hawkins of exeter to tell me all about my new estate in london
you shall i trust test here with me awhile so that by our talking i may learn the english intonation
and i would that you tell me when i make error even if the smallest in my speaking
i am sorry that i had to be away so long today but you will i know forgive one who has so many important affairs in hand
of course i said all i could about being willing and asked if i might come into that room when i chose
he answered yes certainly and added
you may go anywhere you wish in the castle except where the doors are locked where of course you will not wish to go
there is reason that all things are as they are and did you see with my eyes and know with my knowledge you would perhaps better understand
i said i was sure of this and then he went on
we are in transylvania and transylvania is not england
our ways are not your ways and there shall be to you many strange things
nay from what you have told me of your experiences already you know something of what strange things there may be
this led to much conversation and as it was evident that he wanted to talk if only for talking's sake i asked him many questions regarding things that has already happened to me or come within my notice
sometimes he steered off the subject or turned the conversation by pretending not to understand but generally be a news recall i asked most frankly
then as time went on and i had got somewhat holder i asked him of some of the strange things of the preceding night as for instance why the coachman went to the places where he had seen the blue flames
he then explained to me that it was commonly believed that on a certain night of the year last night in fact when all evil spirits are supposed to have unchecked away a blue flame is seen over any place where treasure has been concealed
that treasure has been hidden he went on in the region through which you came last night there can be but little doubt
for it was the ground fought over for centuries by the walls chian the saxon and the turk
why there is hardly a foot of soil in all this region that has not been enriched by the blood of men patriots or invaders
in the old days there were stirring times when the austrian and the hungarian came up in horses and the patriots went out to meet them men and women theater and the children too and waited their coming on the risks above the passes that they might sweep destruction on them with their artificial avalanches
when the invader was triumphant he found but little for whatever there was had been sheltered in the friendly soil
but how said i can it have remained so long undiscovered when there is a sure index to it if men will but take the trouble to look
the count smiled and as his lips ran back over his gums the long sharp canine teeth showed out strangely
he answered because your peasant is at heart a coward and a fool
those flames only appear on one night and on that night no man of this land will if he can help it stir without how doors
and dear sir even if he did he would not know what to co
why even the peasant that you tell me of who marked the place of the flame would not know where to look in daylight even for his own work
even you would not i dare be sworn be able to find these places again
there you are right i said
i know no more than the dead where even to look for them
then we drifted into other matters
come he said at last tell me of london and of the house which you have procured for me
with an apology for my remiss news i went into my own room to get the papers from my bag
whilst i was placing them in order i heard a rattling of china and silver in the next room and ask passed through noticed that the table had been cleared and the lamp lit for it was by this time deep into the dark
the lamps were also put in the study of library and i found the sound lying on the sofa reading of all things in the world an english bradshaw's guide
when i came in. he cleared the books and papers from the table and with him i went into plans and weeds and figures of all sorts
he was interested in everything and asked me a myriad questions about the place and its surroundings
he clearly has studied beforehand all he could get on the subject of the neighbourhood for he evidently at the end knew very much more than i did
when i remarked this he answered
well but my friend is it not needful that i should
when i got here i shall be all alone and my friend marked jonathan may pardon me
i fall into my country's habit of putting your patronymic first my friend iona than market will not be by my side to correct and aid me
he will be in exeter miles away probably working at papers of the law with my other friend peter hawkins
so
we went thoroughly into the business of the purchase of the estate at purfleet
when i had told him the facts and got his signature to the necessary papers and had written a letter with them ready to post time
hawkins he began to ask me how i had come across so suitable a place
i read to him the notes which i had made at the time and which i inscribe here
at purfleet on any road i came across just such a place as seemed to be required and where was displayed a dilapidated notice that the place was for sale
it was surrounded by a high wall of ancient structure built of heavy stones and has not been repaired for a large number of years
the closed rates are of heavy old oak and it on all eaten with rust
the estate is called carfax no doubt a corruption of the old quatre face as the house is four sided agreeing with the cardinal points of the compass
it contains in all some twenty acres quite surrounded by the solid stone wall above mentioned
there are many trees on it which make it in places gloomy and there is a deep dark looking pond or small lake evidently fed by some springs as the water is clear and blows away in a fair sized stream
the house is very large and of all periods back i should say to mediaeval times for one part is of stone immensely thick with only a few windows high up and heavily barred with iron
it looks like part of sleep and is close to an old chapel of church
i could not enter it as i had not the key of the door leading to it from the house but i have taken with my kodak views of it from various points
the house had been added to but in a very straggling war and i can only guess at the amount of ground it covers which must be very great
there are but few houses close at hand one being a very large house only recently added to and formed into a private lunatic asylum
it is not however visible from the grounds
when i had finished he said i am glad that it is old and big
i myself am of an old family and to live in a new house would kill me
a house can not be made habitable in a day and after all how few days go to make up a century
i rejoice also that there is a chapel of old times
we transylvanian nobles love not to think that our bones may lie amongst the common dead
i seek not gaiety nor north not the bright voluptuousness of much sunshine and sparkling waters which please the young and gay
i am no longer young and my heart through weary years of mourning over the dead is not attuned to mirth
moreover the walls of my castle are broken
the shadows are many and the wind breathes sold through the broken battlements and casements
i love the shade and the shadow and would be alone with my thou umts when i may
somehow his words and his look did not seem to accord or else it was that his cast pc face made his smile look malignant and saturn one
presently with an excuse he left me asking me to pull my papers together
he was zone little time away and i began to look at some of the books around me
one was an atlas which i found opened naturally to england as if that map had been much used
on looking at it i found in certain places little rings marked and on examining these i noticed that one was near london on the east side manifestly where his new estate was situated
the other two were exeter and whitby on the yorkshire coast
it was the better part of an hour when the count returned
aha
he said
still at your books
good
but you must not work always
come
i am informed that you're upper is ready
he took my arm and we went into the next room where i found an excellent supper ready on the table
the count again excused himself as he had dined out on his being away from home
but he sa tas on the previous night and chatted whilst i ate
after supper i smoke was on the last evening and the count stayed with me chatting and asking questions on every conceivable subject hour after hour
i felt that it was getting very late indeed but i did not say anything for i felt under obligation to meet my host's wishes in every day
i was not sleepy as the long sleep yesterday had fortified me but i could not help experiencing that chill which comes over one at the coming of the dawn which is like in its way the turn of the tide
they say that people who are near death due generally at the change to dawn or at the turn of the tide
anyone who had when tired and tied as it were to his post experienced this change in the atmosphere can well believe it
all at once we heard the crow of the dock coming up with preternatural she illness through the clear morning air
count dracula jumping to his feet said why there is the morning again
how remiss i am to let you stay up so long
you must make your conversation regarding my dear new country of england less interesting so that i may not forget how time flies by us and with a courtly how he quickly left me
i went into my room and drew the curtains but there was little to notice
my window opened into the courtyard all i could see was the dark grey of quickening sky
so i pulled the curtains again and have written of this day
may
i began to fear as i wrote in this book that i was getting too diffuse
but now i am glad that i went into detail from the first for there is something so strange about this place and all in it that i can not but feel uneasy
i wish i were safe out of it or that i had never come
it may be that this strange night existence is telling on me but would that that were all
if there were anyone to talk to i could hear it but there is no one
i have only the count to speak with and he i fear i am myself the only living soul within the place
if there prosaic so far as facts can be
it will help me to beat up and imagination must not run riot with me
if it does i am post
let me say at once howie tag for seem to
i only slept a few hours when i went to bed and feeling that i could not sleep anymore got up
i had hung my shaving glass by the window and was just beginning to shave
suddenly i felt a hand on my shoulder and heard the count's voice saying to me good morning
i started for it amazes me that i had not seen him since the reflection of the glass covered the whole room behind me
in starting i had cut myself slightly but did not notice it at the moment
having answered the count's salutation i turned to the glass again to see how i had been mistaken
this time there could be no error for the man was close to me and i could see him over my shoulder
but there was no reflection of him in the mirror
the whole room behind me was displayed but there was no sign of a man in it except myself
this was startling and coming on the top of so many strange things was beginning to increase that vague feeling of uneasiness which i always have when the count is gear
but at the instant i saw that the cut had fled a little and the blood was trickling over my chin
i laid down the razor turning as i did so half round to look for some sticking plaster
when the counts as my face his eyes glazed with a sort of demoniac fury and he suddenly made a grab at my throat
i drew away and his hand touched the string of beads which held the crucifix
it made an instant change in him for the fury passed so quickly that i could hardly believe that it was ever there
take care he said take care how you cut yourself
it is more dangerous that you think in this country
then seizing the shaving glass he went on and this is the wretched thing that has done the mischief
it is a foul bauble of man's vanity
away with it
and opening the window with one wrench of his terrible hand he flung out the glass which was shattered into a thousand pieces on the stones of the courtyard far below
then he withdrew without a word
it is very annoying for i do not see how i am to shave unless in my watch case of the bottom of the shaving pot which is fortunately of metal
when i went into the dining room breakfast was prepared but i could not find the count anywhere
so i breakfasted alone
it is strange that as yet i have not seen the count eat or drink
he must be a very peculiar man
after breakfast i did a little exploring in the castle
i went out on the stairs and found a room looking towards the south
the view was magnificent and from where i stood there was every opportunity of seeing it
the castle is on the very edge of a terrific precipice
a stone falling from the window would call a thousand feet without touching anything
as far as the eye can reach is a sea of green tree tops with occasionally a deep gift where there is a chasm
here and there are silver threads where the river swindon deep gorges through the forests
but i am not in heart to describe beauty for when i had seen the view i explored further
doors doors doors everywhere and all locked and bolted
in no place save from the windows in the castle walls is there an available exit
the castle is a veritable prison and i am a prisoner
chapter jonathan harker's journal continued when i found that i was a prisoner a sort of wild feeling came over me
i rushed up and down the stairs trying every door and peering out of every window i could find but after a little the conviction of my helplessness overpowered all other feelings
when i look back after a few hours i think i must have been made of the time for i behaved much as a rat does in a trap
when however the conviction had come to me that i was helpless i sat down quietly as quietly as i have ever done anything in my life and began to think over what was best to be done
i am thinking still and as yet have come to no definite conclusion
on one thing only am i certain
that it is no use making my ideas known to the count
he knows well that i am imprisoned and as he has done it himself and has doubtless his own motives for it he would only deceive me if i trusted him fully with the facts
so far as i can see my only plan will be to keep my knowledge and my fears to myself and my eyes open
i am i know either being deceived like a baby by my own fears or else i am in desperate straits and if the latter he so i need and small need all my brains to get through
i had hardly come to this conclusion when i heard the great door below shut and knew that the count had returned
he did not come at once into the library so i went cautiously to my own room and found him making the bed
this was odd but only confirmed what i had all along thought that there are no servants in the house
when later i saw him through the chunk of the hinges of the door laying the table in the dining room i was assured of it
for if he does himself all these menial offices surely it is proof that there is no one else in the castle it must have been the count himself who was the driver of the coach that brought me here
this is a terrible thought for if so what does it mean that he vou of control the wolves as he did by only holding up his name for silence
how was it that all the people at his fritz and on the coach had some terrible fear for me
what meant the giving of the crucifix of the garlic of the wild rose of the mountain ash
views that good good woman who jung the crucifix round my neck
for it is a comfort and a strength to me whenever i touch it
it is odd that a thing which i have been taught to regard with disfavour and as idolatrous should in a time of loneliness and trouble be of help
is it that there is something in the essence of the thing itself or that it is a medium a tangible help in conveying memories of sympathy and comfort
sometime if it maybe i must examine this matter and try to make up my mind about it
in the meantime i must find out all is an about count dracula as it may help me to understand
tonight he may talk of himself if i turn the conversation that way
i must be very careful however not to awake his suspicion
midnight
i have had a long talk with the count
i asked him a few questions on transylvania history and he warmed up to the subject wonderfully
in his speaking of things and people and especially of battle she spoke as if he had been present at the mall
this he afterwards explained by saying that to a boy at the pride of his house and name is his own pride that their glory is his glory that their fate is his fate
whenever he spoke of his house he always said dean's spoke almost in the plural like a king speaking
i wish i could put down all he said exactly as he said it for time it was most fascinating
it seemed to have in its whole history of the country
he grew excited as he spoke and walked about the room pulling his great white moustache and grasping anything on which he laid his hands as though he would crush it by main strength
one thing he said which i shall put down as nearly as i can for it tells in its way the story of his race
we szekely's have a right to be proud for in our veins glows the blood of many brave races who fought as the lion fights for lordship
here in the whirlpool of european faces the ugric tribe bore down from iceland the fighting spirit which thor and woe in gave them which their berzerker's displayed to such fell intent on the sea boards of europe age and of asia and africa too till the people's thought that the werewolves themselves had come
here too when they came they found rbf guys whose warlike fury had swept the earth like a living flame fill the dying people's held that in their veins ran the blood of those old witches who expelled from scythia had mated with the devils in the desert
tools tools
what devil or what witch was ever so great as attila whose blood is in these veins
he held up his arms
is it a wonder that we were a conquering race that we were proud that when the many as the lombard the agar the vulgar or the turk poured his thousands on our frontiers we drove them back
is it strange that when a road and his legions swept through the hungarian fatherland he found us here when he reached the frontier that they info goal as was completed there
and when the hungarian flood swept eastward the szekely's were claimed as kindred by the victorious magyars and to us for centuries was trusted the guarding of the frontier of turkey land
aye and more than that endless duty of the frontier guard for as the turks say' water sleeps and the enemy is sleepless
's no more gladly than we throughout the four nations received the' bloody sword' or at its warlike call flocked quicker to the standard of the king
when was redeemed that great shame of my nation the shame of case of a when the flags of the wallach and the magyar went down beneath the crescent
who was it but one of my own race who ascii code crossed the danube and beat the turk on his own ground
this was a dracula indeed
wow was it that his own unworthy brother when he had fallen sold his people to the turk and brought the shame of slavery on them
was it not this dracula indeed who inspired that other of his race who in a later age again and again brought his forces over the great river into turkey land ago when he was beaten back came again and again though he had to come alone from the bloody field where his troops were being slaughtered since he knew that he alone could ultimately triumph
they said that he thought only of himself
bag
what good are peasants without a leader
where ends the war without a brain and heart to conduct it
again when after the battle of mohave we threw off the hungarian you fee of the dracula blood were amongst their leaders for our spirit would not brook that we were not free
ah young for the szekely d and the dracula as their heart's blood their brains and their swords can boast a record that mushroom growths like the hapsburgs and the roman offs can never reach
the warlike days are over
blood is too precious a thing in these days of dishonourable peace and the glories of the great races are as a half that is good
it was by this time close in morning and we went to bed
men
this diary seems horribly like the beginning of the arabian nights for everything has to break of fat cock crow or like the ghost of hamlet's father
may
let me begin with facts bare meager facts verified by hooks and figures and of which there can be no doubt
i just not confuse them with experiences which will have to rest on my own observation of my memory of them
last evening when the count came from his room he began by asking me questions on legal matters and on the doing of certain kinds of business
i had spent the day wearily over books and simply to keep my mind occupied went over some of the matters i had been examined in at lincoln's inn
there was a certain method in the count's inquiries so i shall try to put them down in sequence
the knowledge may somehow or sometime be useful to me
first he asked if a man in england might have two solicitors or more
i told him he might have a dozen if he wished but that it would not be wise to have more than one solicitor engaged in one transaction as only one could act at a time and that to change would be seems into militate against his interest
he seemed thoroughly to understand and went on to ask if there would be any practical difficulty in having one man to attend day to banking and another to look after shipping in case local help were needed in a place far from the home of the banking solicitor
i asked to explain more fully so that i might not by any chance mislead him so he said i shall illustrate
your friend and mine jr.
peter hawkins from under the shadow of your beautiful cathedral at exeter which is far from london buys for me through your food self my place at london
good
nowhere let me say frankly lest you should think it strange that i have sought the services of one so far off from london instead of someone resident there that my motive was that no local interest might be served save my wish only and as one of london residence might perhaps have some purpose of himself or friend to serve i want this afield to seek my agent whose labours should be only to my interest
now suppose i who have much of affairs wish to ship to its way to newcastle or durham or harwich or river might it not be that it could with more ease be done by consigning no one in these ports
i answered that certainly it would be most easy but that we solicitors had a system or agency one for the other so that local work could be done locally on instruction from any solicitor so that the client simply placing himself in the hands of one man could have his wishes carried out by him without further trouble
but said he i could be at liberty to direct myself
is it not so
of course i replied and such is often done by men of business who do not like the whole of their affairs to be known by any one person
good
he said and then went on to ask about the means of making consignments and the forms to be gone through and of all sorts of difficulties which might arise but by forethought could be guarded against
i explained all these things to him to the best of my ability and he certainly left me under the impression that he would have made a wonderful solicitor for there was nothing that he did not think of or foresee
for a man who was never in the country and who did not evidently so much in the way of business his knowledge and acumen were wonderful
when he had satisfied himself on these points of which he had spoken and i had verified all as well as i could by the books available he suddenly stood up and said have you written since your first letter to our friend mr.
peter hawkins or to any other
it was with some bitterness in my heart that i answered that i had not that as yet i had not seen any opportunity of sending letters to anybody
then write now my young friend he said laying a heavy hand on my shoulder write to our friend and to any other and say if it will please you that you shall stay with me until a month from now
do you wish me to stay so long
i asked for my heart grew cold at the thought
i desire it much hay i will take no refusal
when your master employer what you will engaged that someone should come on his behalf it was understood that my needs only were to be consulted
i have not stunted
is it not so
what could i do but now acceptance
it was mr.
hawkins' interest not mine and i had to think of him not myself and besides while counts tax how was speaking there was that in his eyes and in his bearing which made me remember that i was a prisoner and that if i wished it i could have no choice
the counts as his victory in my bow and his mastery in the trouble of my face for he began at once to use them but in his own smooth resistless say
i pray you my good young friend that you will not discourse of things other than business in your letters
it will doubtless please your friends to know that you are well and that you look forward to getting home to them
is it not so
as he spoke he handed me three sheets of notepaper and three envelopes
they were all of the thinnest foreign post and looking at them than at him and noticing his quiet smile with the sharp canine teeth lying over the red under lip i understood as well as if he had spoken that i should be more careful what i wrote for he would be able to read it
so i determined to write only formal notes now buy to write fully home
hawkins in secret and also to mins for tiger i could write shorthand which would puzzle the count if he did see it
when i had written my two letters is at quiet reading a book whilst the count wrote several notes referring as he wrote them to some books on his table
then he took up my two and placed them with his own and put by his writing materials after which the instant the door had closed behind him i leaned over and looked at the letters which were face down on the table
i felt no compunction in doing so for under the circumstances i felt that i should protect myself in every way i could
one of the letters was directed to samuel f.
billington no
the crescent whitby another go here leitner varna
the third was to court's so
london and the fourth to her reno lipstick bill truth bankers budapest h
the second and fourth were unsealed
i was just about to look at them when i saw the door handle move
i sank back in my seat having just had time to resume my book before the count holding still another letter in his hand entered the room
he took up the letters on the table and stamped them carefully and then turning tome saudi trust you will forgive me but i have much work to do in private this evening
you will i hope find all things as you wish
at the door he turned and after a moment's pause said let me advise you my dear young friend
may let me warn you with all seriousness that should you leave these rooms you will not by any chance go to sleep in any other part of the castle
it is old and has many memories and there are bad dreams for those who sleep unwisely
be warned
should sleep now or ever overcome you or be like to do then haste to your own chamber or to these rooms for your rest will then be safe
but if you be not careful in this respect then he finished his speech in a gruesome way for he motioned with his hands as if he were washing them
i quite understood
my only doubt was as to whether any dream could be more terrible than the unnatural horrible net of gloom and mystery which seemed closing around me
later
i endorse the last words written but this time there is no doubt in question
i shall not fear to sleep in any place where he is not
i have placed the crucifix over the head of my bed i imagine that my rest is this freed from dreams and there it shall remain
when he left me i went to my room
after a little while not hearing any sound i came out and went up the stones fair to where i could look out towards the south
there was some sense of freedom in the vast expanse inaccessible though it was to me as compared with the narrow darkness of the courtyard
looking out on this i felt that i was indeed in prison and i seemed to want a breath of fresh air though it were of the night
i am beginning to feel this nocturnal existence help on me
it is destroying my nerve
i start at my own shadow and am full of all sorts of horrible imaginings
god knows that there is ground for my terrible fear in this accursed place
i looked out over the beautiful expanse bathed in soft yellow moonlight till it was almost a slight aedst
in the soft light the distant hills became melted and the shadows in the valleys and gorges of velvety blackness
the mere beauty seemed to cheer me
there was peace and comfort in every breath i drew
as i leaned from the window my eye was caught by something moving a storey below me and somewhat to my left where i imagined from the order of the rooms that the windows of the count's own room would look out
the window at which i stood was tall and deep stone million ed and though weather worn was still complete
but it was evidently many a day since the case had been there
i drew back behind the stonework and looked carefully out
what i saw was the count's head coming out from the window
i did not see the face but i knew the man by the neck and the movement of his back and arms
in any case i could not mistake the hands which i had had some many opportunities of studying
i was at first interested and somewhat amused for it is wonderful how small a matter will interest and amuse a man when he is a prisoner
but my very feelings changed to repulsion and terror when i saw the whole man slowly emerge from the window and begin to crawl down the castle wall over the dreadful abyss face down with his cloak spreading out around him like great wings
at first i could not believe my eyes
i thought it was some trick of the moonlight some weird effect of shadow but i kept looking and it could be no delusion
i saw the fingers and toes grasp the corners of the stones worn clear of the mortar by the stress of years and by rhys using every projection and inequality move downwards with considerable speed just as a lizard moves along a wall
what manner of man is this or what manner of creature is it in the semblance of man
i feel the dread of this horrible place overpowering me
i am in fear in awful fear and there is no escape for me
jan encompassed about eight errors that i dare not think of
may
once more i have seen the count go out in his lizard fashion
he moved downwards in a side long way some hundred feet down and a good deal to the left
he vanished into some hole or window
when his head had disappeared i leaned out to try and see more but without avail
the distance was too great to allow a proper angle of sight
i knew he had left the castle now and thought to use the opportunity to explore more than i had dared to do as yet
i went back to the room and taking a lamp tried all the doors
they were all locked as i had expected and the locks were comparatively new
but i went down the stone stairs to the hall where i had entered originally
i found i could pull back the bolts easily enough and unhook the great chains
but the door was locked and the key was gone
that key must be in the count's room
i must watch should his door be unlocked so that i may get it and escape
i went on to make a thorough examination of the various stairs and passages and to try the doors that opened from them
one or two small rooms near the hall were open but there was nothing to see in them except old furniture dusty with age and not beaten
at last however i found one door at the top of the stairway which though it seemed locked have a little under pressure
i tried it harder and found that it was not really locked but that the resistance came from the fact that the hinges had fallen somewhat and the heavy door rested on the floor
here was an opportunity which i might not have again so i exerted myself and with many efforts forced it back so that i could enter
i was now in swing of the castle further to the right than the rooms i knew and a storey lower down
from the windows i could see that the suite of rooms lay along to the south of the castle the windows of the end room looking out both west and south
on the latter side as well as to the former there was a great precipice
the castle was built on the corner of a great rock so that on the desires it was quite impregnable and great windows were placed here where sling or bow or silver in could not reach and consequently light and comfort impossible to a position which had to be guarded were secured
to the west was a great valley and then rising far away great jagged mountain fast nesses rising peak on peak the sheer rock studded with mountain ash and thorn whose roots clubbin cracks and crevices and crannies of the stone
this was evidently the portion of the castle occupied by the ladies in bygone days for the furniture had korean air of comfort than any i had seen
the windows were curtain less and the yellow moonlight flooding in through the diamond pages enabled one to see even colours whilst it softened the wealth of dust which lay overall and disguised in some measure the ravages of time and moth
my lamp seemed to be of little effect in the brilliant moonlight but i was glad to have it with me for there was a dread loneliness in the place which chilled my heart and made my nerves tremble
still it was better than living alone in the rooms which i had come to hate from the presence of the count and after trying a little to school my nerves i found a soft quietude come over me
here i am sitting at a little oak table where in old times possibly some fair lady's art open with much thought and many blushes her ill slept love letter and writing in my diary in shorthand all that has happened since i closed it last
it is the nineteenth century uptodate with a vengeance
and yet unless my senses deceive me the old centuries had and have powers of their own which mere modernity can not kill
later the morning of may
god preserve my sanity for to this i am reduced
safety and the assurance of safety are things of the past
whilst i live on here there is but one thing to hope for that i may not go mad if indeed i be not had already
if i became then surely it is maddening to think that of all the foul things that lurk in this hateful place the count is the least dreadful to me that to him alone i can look for safety even though this be only whilst i can serve his purpose
great god
merciful god let me be calm for out of that way lies madness indeed
i begin to get new lights on certain things which have puzzled me
up to now i never quite knew what shakespeare meant when he made hamlet say my tablets
quick mg tablets
' tis meet that i put it down etc.
for now feeling as though my own brain were unhinged or as if the shock had come which must end in its undoing i turn to my diary for repose
the habit of entering accurately must help to soothe me
the count's mysterious warning frightened me at the time
it frightens me more now when i think of it for on the future he has a fearful hold upon me
i shall bear to doubt what he may say
when i had written in my diary and had fortunately replaced the book and pen in my pocket i felt sleepy
the count's warning came into my mind but i took pleasure in disobeying it
the sense of sleep was upon me and with it the obstinacy which sleep brings as outrider
the soft moonlight soothes and the wide expanse without gave a sense of freedom which refreshed me
i determined not to return tonight to the gloom haunted rooms but to sleep here whereof old ladies had sat and sung and lived sweet lives whilst their gentle breasts were sad for their menfolk away in the midst of remorseless wars
i drew a great couch out of its place near the corner so that as i lay i could look at the lovely view to east and south and in thinking of and uncaring for the dust composed myself for sleep
i suppose i must have fallen asleep
i hope so but i fear for all that followed was startling lure also deal that now sitting here in the broad full sunlight of the morning i can not in the least believe that it was all sleep
i was not alone
the room was the same unchanged in anyway since i came into it
i could see along the floor in the brilliant moonlight my own foot steps marked where i had disturbed the long accumulation of dust
in the moonlight opposite me were three young women ladies by their dress and manner
i thought at the time that i must be dreaming when i saw them they threw no shadow on the floor
they came close to me and looked at me for some time and then whispered together
two were dark and had high aquiline noses like the count and great dark piercing eyes that seemed to be almost red when contrasted with the pale yellow moon
the other was fair as fair as can be with great masses of golden hair and eyes like pale sapphires
i seemed somehow to know her face and to know it in connection with some dreamy fear but i could not recollect at the moment how or where
all three had brilliant white teeth that shone like pearls against the ruby of their voluptuous lips
there was something about them that made me uneasy some longing and at the same time some deadly fear
i felt in my heart a wicked burning desire that they would kiss me with those red lips
it is not hope to note this down lest some day it should meet mina's eyes and cause her pain but it is the truth
they whispered to get her and then they all three laughed such a silvery musical laugh but as hard as though the sound never could have come through the softness of human lips
it was like the intolerable tingling sweetness of water glasses when played on by a cunning hand
the fair girl shook her head coquettish it and the other two urged her on
one said goon
you are first and we shall follow
hours of the right to begin
the other added he is young and strong
there are kisses for us all
i lay quiet looking out from under my eyelashes in an agony of delightful anticipation
the fair girl advanced and bent over me till i could feel the movement of her breath upon me
sweet it was in one sense honey sweet and sent the same tingling through the nerves as her voice but with a bitter underlying the sweet a bitter offensiveness as one smells in blood
i was afraid to raise my eyelids but looked out and saw perfectly under the lashes
the girl went on her knees and bent over me simply floating
there was a deliberate voluptuousness which was both thrilling and repulsive and as she arched her neck she actually picked her lips like an animal till i could see in the moonlight the moisture shining on the scarlet lips and on the red tongue as it lapped the white sharp teeth
lower and lower sent her head as the lips went below the range of my mouth and chin and seemed to fasten on my throat
then she paused and i could hear the churning sound of her tongue as it licked her teeth and lips and i could feel the hot breath on my neck
then the skin of my throat began to tingle as one's flesh does when the hand that is to tickle it approaches nearer nearer
i could feel the soft shivering touch of the lips on the super sensitive skin of my throat and the hard dents of two sharp teeth just touching and pausing there
i closed my eyes in languorous ecstasy and wanted waited with beating heart
but at that instant another sensation swept through me as quick as lightning
i was conscious of the presence of the count and of his being as if lapped in a storm of fury
as my eyes opened involuntarily i saw his strong hand grasp the slender neck of the fair woman and with giant's power draw it back the blue eyes transformed with fury the white teeth stamping with rage and the fair cheeks blazing red with passion
but the count
never did i imagine such wrath and fury even to the demons of the pit
his eyes were positively blazing
the red light in them was our idea of the flames of hellfire blazed behind them
his face was deathly pale and the lines if it were hard like drawn wires
the thick eyebrows that get over the nose now seemed like a heading bar of white hot metal
with a fierce sweep of his arm he hurled the woman from him and then motioned to the others as though he were beating them back
it was the same imperious feature that i had seen used to the wolves
in a voice which though low and almost in a whisper seemed to cut through the air and then ring in the room he said how dare you touch him any of you
how dare you cast eyes on him when i had forbidden it
back i tell you all
this man belongs to me
beware now you meddle with him or you'll have to deal with me
the fair girl with a laugh of ribald to sherry turned to answer him
you yourself never loved
you never love
on this the other women joined and such a mirth less hard soulless laughter rang through the room that it almost made me faint to hear
it seemed like the pleasure of fiends
then the count turner after looking at my face attentively and said in a soft whisper yes i too can love
you yourselves can tell it from the past
is it not so
well now i promise you that when i am done with tim you shall kiss him at your will
now go
go
i must awaken him for there is work to be done
areas to have nothing tonight
said one of them with a low laugh as she pointed to the bag which he had thrown upon the floor and which moved as though there were some living things i think t
for answer he nodded his head
one of the women jumped forward and opened it
if my ears did not deceive me there was a gasp and a low wall as of a half smothered child
the women closed round whilst i was aghast with horror
but as i looked they disappeared and with them the dreadful bag
there was no door near them and they could not have passed me without my noticing
they simply seemed to fade into the rays of the moonlight and pass out through the window for i could see outside the cim shadowy forms for a moment before they entirely faded away
then the horror overcame me and i sank down unconscious
chapter jonathan harker's journal continued i awoke in my own bed
if it be that i had not dreamt the count must have carried me here
i tried to satisfy myself on the subject but could not arrive at any unquestionable result
to be sure there were certain small evidences such as that my clothes were folded and laid by in a manner which was not my habit
my watch was still unsound and i am rigorously accustomed to win got the last thing before going to bed and many such details
but these things are no proof for they may have been evidences that my mind was not as usual and for some cause or another i had certainly been much upset
i must watch for proof
of one thing i am glad
if it was that the count carried me here and undressed me he must have been hurried in his task for my pockets are intact
i am sure this diary would have been a mystery to him which he would not have broiled
he would have taken or destroyed it
as i look round this room although it has been to me so full of fear it is now a sort of sanctuary for nothing can be more dreadful than those awful women who were who are waiting to suck my blood
may
i have been down to look at that room again in daylight for i must know the truth
when i got to the doorway at the top of the stairs i found it closed
it had been so forcibly driven against the jamb that part of the woodwork was splintered
i could see that the bolt of the lock had not been shot but the door is fastened from the inside
i fear it was no dream and must act of this surmise
may
i am surely in the tools
last night the count asked me in the suave at times to write three letters one saying that my work here dsa nearly done and that i should start for home within a few days another that i was starting on the next morning from the time of the letter and the third that i had left the castle and arrived at biarritz
i would fain have rebelled but felt that in the present state of things it would be madness to quarrel openly with the count whilst i am so absolutely in his power
and to refuse would be to excite his suspicion and to arouse his anger
he knows that i know too much and that i just not live led to be dangerous to him
my only chance is to prolong my opportunities
something may occur which will give me a chance to escape
i saw in his eyes something of that gathering wrath which was manifest when he hurled that fair woman from him
he explained to me that posts were few and uncertain and that my writing now would ensure ease of mind to my friends
and he assured me with so much impressive news that he would counter m. and the later letters which would be held over at bistrita until due time in case chance would admit of my prolonging my stay that to oppose him would have been to create new suspicion
i therefore pretended to fall in with his views and asked him what dates i should put on the letters
he calculated a minute and they said the first should be june the second june and the third june
i know how the span of my life
god help me
may
there is a chance of escape or at any date of being able to send word home
a band of s. zhang have come to the castle and are encamped in the courtyard
these are tips ies
i have notes of them in my book
they are peculiar to this part of the world though allied to the ordinary tips he's all the world over
there are thousands of them in hungary and transylvania who are almost outside all law
they attach themselves as a rule to some great noble or boyar and call themselves by his name
they are fearless and without religion save superstition and they talk only their own varieties of the romany tongue
i shall write some letters home and shall try to get them to have them posted
i have already spoken to them through my window to begin acquaintance ship
that took their hats off and made obeisance and many signs which however i could not understand any more than i could their spoken language
i have written the letters
mina's is in shorthand and i simply ask me
hawkins to communicate with her
to her i have explained my situation but without the horrors which i may only surmise
it would shock and frighten her to death were i to expose my heart to her
should the letters not carry then the count shall not yet know my secret of the extent of my knowledge
i have given the letters
i threw them through the bars of my window with a good piece and made what signs i could to have them posted
the man who took them pressed them to his heart and bowed and then put them in his cap
i could do no more
i stole back to the study and began to read
as the count did not come in. i have written here
the count has come
he sat down beside me and said in his smoothest voice as he opened two letters the saga my has given me these of which though i know not whence they come is hall of course take care
see
he must have looked at it
one is from you and to my friend peter hawkins
the other her she caught sight of the strange symbols as he opened the envelope and the dark look came into his face and his eyes glazed wickedly the other is a file thing an outrage upon friendship and hospitality
it is not signed
well
so it can not matter to us
and he calmly held letter and envelope in the flame of the lamp till they were consumed
then he went on the letter to hawkins that is hall of courses end of since it is yours
your letters are sacred tome
your pardon my friend that unknowingly i did break the seal
will you not cover it again
he held out the letter to me and with a courteous now handed me a clean envelope
i could only redirect it and hand it to him in silence
when he went out of the room i could hear the key turn softly
a minute later i went over and tried it and the door was locked
when an hour or two after the count came quietly into the room his coming awakened me for i had gone to sleep on the sofa
he was very courteous and very cheery in his manner and seeing that i had been sleeping he said so my friend you are tired
get to bed
there is the surest rest
i may not have the pleasure of talk tonight since there are many labour's time but you will sleep i pray
i passed to my room and went to bed and strange to say slept without dreaming
despair has its own calms
may
this morning when i woke i thought i would provide myself with some papers and envelopes from my bay and keep them in my pocket so that i might write in case i should get an opportunity but again a surprise again a shock
every scrap of paper was gone and with it all my notes my memoranda relating to railways and travel my letter of credit in fact all that might be useful to mr. were i once outside the castle
i sat and pondered awhile and then some thought occurred to me and i made search of my portmanteau and in the wardrobe where i had placed my clothes
the suit in which i had travelled was gone and also my overcoat and rug
i could find no trace of them anywhere
this looked like some new scheme of villainy
june
this morning as i was sitting on the edge of my bed did telling my brains i heard without a crackling of whips and pounding and scraping of horses' feet up the rocky path beyond the courtyard
with joy i hurried to the window and saw drive into they are two great leiter wagons each drawn by eight sturdy horses and at the head of each pair a slovak with his wife hat great mail studded belt fiery sheepskin and high boots
they had also their long stages in hand
iran to the door intending to descend and try and join them through the main hall as i thought that way might be opened for them
again a shock my door was fastened on the outside
then i ran to the window and cried to the k
they looked up at me stupidly and pointed but just then the herman of the way any came out and seeing them pointing to my window said something at which they laughed
henceforth no effort of mine no piteous cry or agonized entreaty would make them even look at me
they resolutely turned away
the leiter wagons contained great square boxes with handles of thick rope
these were evidently empty by the ease with which the slovaks handled them and by their resonance as they were roughly moved
when they were all unloaded and packed in a great heap in one corner of the yard the slovaks were given some money but he's zhang and spitting on it for luck lazily went each to his horse's head
shortly afterwards i heard the cracking of their ships did away in the distance
june
last night the count left me early and locked himself into his own room
as soon acids res i ran up the winding stair and looked out of the window which opened south
i thought i would watch for the count for there is something going on
the saga ny are quartered somewhere in the castle and are doing work of some kind
i know it for now and then i hear a far away muffled sound as of mattock and space and whatever it is it must be the end of some ruthless villainy
i had been at the window somewhat less than half an hour when i saw something coming out of the count's window
i drew back and watched carefully and saw the whole make merge
it was a new shock to me to find that he had on the suit of clothes which i had worn whilst travelling here and slung over his shoulder the terrible bag which i had seen the women take away
there could be no doubt as to his quest and in my garb top
this the most of new scheme of evil that he will allow others to see me as they think so that he may both leave evidence that i have been seen in the towns or villages posting my own letters and that any wickedness which he may do shall by the local people be attributed to me
it makes me rate to think that this can go on and whilst i am shut up here a veritable prisoner but without that protection of the law which is even a criminal's right and consolation
i thought i would watch for the count's return and for a long time sat doggedly at the window
then i began to notice that there were some quaint little specks floating in the rays of the moonlight
they were like the tiniest grains of dust and they whirled round and gathered in clusters in a nebulous sort of way
i watched them with a sense of soothing and a sort of calm stole over me
i leaned back in the embr a surei'ma more comfortable position so that i could enjoy more fully the aerial gam billing
something made me start up a low piteous howling of dogs somewhere far below in the valley which was hidden from my sight
louder it seemed to ring in my ears and the floating moats of dust to take new shapes to the sound as they danced in the moonlight
i felt myself struggling to awake to some call of my instincts
nay my very soul was struggling and my half remembered sensibilities were striving to answer the call
i was becoming hypnotised
quicker and quicker danced the dust
the moonbeams seemed to quiver as they went by me into the mass of gloom beyond
more and more they gathered till they seemed to take dim phantom shapes
and then i started broad awake and on full possession of my senses and ram screaming from the place
the phantom shapes which were becoming gradually materialised from the moonbeams were those three ghostly women to whom i was doomed
i fled and felt somewhat safer in my own room where there was no moonlight and where the lamp was burning brightly
when a couple of hours had passed i heard something stirring in the count's room something like a sharp fall quickly suppressed
and then there was silence feel awful silence which chilled me
with a beating heart i tried the door but i was locked in my prison and could do nothing
i sat down and simply cried
asus ati heard a sound in the courtyard without the agonised cry of a woman
i rushed to the window and throwing it upper red between the bars
there indeed was a woman with dishevelled hair holding her hands over her heart as one distressed with running
she was leaning against the corner of the gateway
when she saw my face at the windows he threw herself forward and shouted in a voice laden with menace monster give me my child
she threw herself on her knees and raising up her hands cried the same words into nec which wrung my heart
then she tore her hair and beat her breast and abandoned herself to all the violence's of extravagant emotion
finally she threw herself forward and though i could not see her i could hear the beating of her naked hands against the door
somewhere high overhead probably on the tower i heard the voice of the count calling in his harsh metallic whisper
his call seemed to be answered from far and wide by the his king of wolves
before many minutes had passed a lack of them poured like a pent up dam when liberated through the side entrance into the courtyard
there was no cry from the woman and the howling of the wolves was but short
before long they streamed away singly licking their lips
i could not pity her for i knew now what had become of her child and she was better dead
what shall i do
what can i do
how can i escape from this dreadful thing of night gloom and fear
june
no man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be
when the sun grew so high this morning that it struck the top of the great gateway opposite my window the high spot which it touched seemed to me as if the dive from the aroma slightest here
my fear fell from me as if it had been a vaporous garment which dissolved in the warmth
i must take action of some sort whilst the courage of the day is upon me
last night one of my post dated letters sent to post the first of that fatal series which is to blot out the very traces of my existence from the earth
let me not think of it
action
it has always been at night time that i have been molested or threatened or in some way in danger or in fear
i have not yet seen the count in the daylight
san it be that he sleeps when others wake that he may be awake whilst they sleep
if i could only get into his room
but there is no possible way
the door is always locked no way for me
yes there is a way of one dares to take it
where his body has gone why may not another body to
i have seen him myself crawl from his window
why should go to imitate him and doing this window
the chances are desperate but my here is more desperate still
i shall risk it
at the worst it can only be death and a man's death is not a calf's and the dreaded hereafter may still be open to me
god help me in my task
goodbye mihai eurail
goodbye my faithful friend and second father
goodbye all and last of all mina
same day later
i have made the effort and god helping me have come safely back to this room
i must put down every detail in order
i went whilst my courage was fresh straight to the window on the south side and at once got outside in this side
the stones are big and roughly cut and the mortar has by process of time been washed away between them
i took off my boots and ventured out on the desperate way
i looked down once so as to make sure that a sudden glimpse of the awful depth would not overcome me but after that kept my eyes away from it
i know pretty well the direction and distance of the count's window and made for it as well as i could having regard to the opportunities available
i did not feel dizzy i suppose i was too excited and the time seemed ridiculously short till i found myself standing on the windowsill and trying to raise up the sash
i was filled with agitation however when i bent down and slid feet foremost in through the window
then i looked around for the count but with surprise and gladness made a discovery
the room was empty
it was barely furnished with odd things which seemed to have never been used
the furniture was something the same style as that in the south rooms and was covered with dust
i looked for the key but it was not in the lock and i could not find it anywhere
the only thing i found was a great heap of gold in one corner gold of all kinds roman and british and austrian and hungarian and greek and turkish money covered with a film of dust as though it had lain long on the ground
none of it that i noticed was less than three hundred years old
there were also chains and ornaments some jewelled but all of the mold and stained
at one corner of the room was a heavy door
i tried it for since i could not find the key of the room or the key of the outer door which was the main object of my search i must make further examination of all my efforts would be in vain
it was open and led through a stone passage to a circular stairway which went steeply down
i descended minding carefully where i went for the stairs were dark being only lit by loopholes in the heavy masonry
at the bottom there was a dark tunnel like passage through which came a deathly sickly odour the odour of old earth newly turned
as i went through the passage the smell grew closer and heavier
at last i pulled open a heavy door which stood a jar and found myself in an old ruined chapel which had evidently been used as a graveyard
the roof was broken and in two places were steps leading to vaults but the ground had recently been dug over and the earth placed in great wooden boxes manifestly those which had been brought by the slovaks
there was nobody about and i made a search over every inch of the ground so as not to lose a chance
i went down even into the vaults where the dim light struggled although todo el was a dread to my very soul
into two of these i went but saw nothing except fragments of old coffins and piles of dust
in the third however i made a discovery
there in one of the great boxes of which there were fifty in all on a pile of newly dug earth lay the count
he was either dead or asleep
i could not say which for eyes were open and stony but without the glassine as of death and the cheeks had the warmth of life through all their pallor
the lips were acted as ever
but there was no sign of movement no pulse no breath no beating of the heart
i bent over him and tried to find any sign of life but in vain
he could not have lain there long for the earthy smell would have passed away in a few hours
by the side of the box was its cover pierced with holes here and there
i thought he might have the keys on him but when i sent to search i saw the dead eyes and in them dead though they were such a look of hate though unconscious of me of my presence that i fled from the place and leaving the count's room by the window crawled again up the castle wall
regaining my room i threw myself lanting upon the bed and tried to think
june
today is the date of my last letter and the count has taken steps to prove that it was genuine for again i saw him leave the castle by the same window and in my clothes
as he went down the wall lizard fashion i wished i had a gun or some lethal weapon that i might destroy him
but i fear that no weapon wrought along by man's hand would have any effect on him
i dared not wait to see him return for i feared to see those weird sisters
i came back to the library and read there till i fell asleep
i was awakened by the count who looked at me as grumpy as a man could look as he said tomorrow my friend we must part
you return to your beautiful england ito some work which may have such an end that we may never meet
your letter home has been despatched
tomorrow i shall not be here but all shall be ready for your journey
in the morning comet hfs sg any who have some labours of their own here and also come some slovak a
when they have gone my carriage shall come for you and shall bear you to the borgo pass to meet the diligence from bukovina to biarritz
but i am in hopes that i shall see more of you at castle dracula
i suspected him and determined to test his sincerity
sincerity
it seems like a profanation of the word to write it in connection with such a monster so i asked him point blank why maui not go tonight
because dear sir by coachman and horses are away on a mission
but i would walk with pleasure
i want to get away at once
he smiled such a soft smooth diabolical smile that i knew there was some trick behind his smoothness
he said and your baggage
i do not care about it
i can send for it some other time
the count stood up and said with a sweet courtesy which made me rub my eyes it seemed so real you english have a saying which is close to my heart for its spirit is that which rules our voyage' welcome the coming speed the parting guest
' come with me my dear young friend
not an hour shall you wait in my house against your will though sasami at your going and that you so suddenly desire it
come
with a stately gravity me with the lamp preceded me down the stairs and along the hall
suddenly he stopped
mark
close at hand came the howling of many wolves
it was almost as if the sound sprang up at the rising of his hand just as the music of a great orchestra seems to leap under the baton of the conductor
after a pause of a moment he proceeded in his state of way to the door drew back the ponderous bolts unhooked the heavy chains and began to draw it open
to my intense astonishment i saw that it was unlocked
suspiciously i looked all round but could see no key of any kind
as the door began to open the howling of the wolves without grew louder and angrier
their red jaws with stamping teeth and their blunt clawed feet as they leaped came in through the opening door
i knew than that to struggle at the moment against the count was useless
with such allies as the sea this command i could do nothing
but still the door continued slowly to open and only the count's body stood in the gap
suddenly it struck me that this might be the moment and means of my room
i was to be given to the wolves and at my own instigation
there was a diabolical wickedness in the idea great enough for the count and as the last chance i cried out shut the door
i shall wait till morning
and icon feed my face with my hands to hide my tears of bitter disappointment
with one sweep of his powerful arm the count threw the door shut and the great bolts clanged and echoed through the hall as they shot back into their places
in silence we returned to the library and after a minute or two i went to my own room
the last i saw of count dracula was his kissing his hand to me with a red light of triumph in his eyes and with a smile that judas in hell might be proud of
when i was in my room and about to lie down i thought i heard a whispering at my door
i went to it softly and listened
unless my ears deceived me i heard the voice of the count
back
back to your own place
your time is not yet come
wait
have patience
tonight is mine
tomorrow night is yours
there was a low sweet ripple of laugh tax and i garage i threw open the door and saw without the three terrible women licking their lips
as i appeared they all joined on a horrible laugh and ran away
i came back to my room and threw myself on my knees
it is then so near the end
tomorrow
tomorrow
lord help me and those to whom i am dead
june
these may be the last words i ever write in this diary
i slept till just before the dawn and when i woke threw myself on my knees for i determined that if death came he should find me ready
at last i felt that subtle change in the air and knew that the morning had come
then came the welcome cock cris and i felt that i was safe
with a glad heart i opened the door and ran down the hall
i had seen that the door was unlocked and now escape was before me
with hands that trembled with eagerness i unhooked the chains and threw back the massive bolts
but the door would not move
despair seized me
i pulled and pulled at the door and shook it till massive as it was it rattled in its casement
i could see the bolts hot
it had been locked after i left the count
then a wild desire took me to obtain the key at any risk and i determined then and there to scale the wall again and gain the blunt's room
he might kill me but death how seemed the happier choice of evils
without a pause i rushed up to the east window and scrambled down the wall as before into the count's room
it was empty but that was as i expected
i could not see a key anywhere but the heap of gold remained
i went through the door in the corner and down the winding stair and along the dark passage to the old chapel
i knew how well enough where to find the monster i sought
the great god was in the same place close against the wall but the lid was laid on it not fastened down but with the nails ready in their places to be hammered home
i knew i must reach the body for the jet ski raised the lid and laid it back against the wall
and then i saw something which filled my very soul with horror
the relay the count but looking as if his youth had been half restored
for the white hair and moustache were changed to dark iron grey
the cheeks were filled and the white skin seemed ruby red underneath
the mouth was redder than ever for on the lips were hours of fresh blood which trickled from the corners of the mouth and ran down over the chin and neck
even the deep burning eyes seemed set amongst swollen flesh for the pics and pouches underneath were floated
it seemed as if the whole awful creature were simply forged with blood
he lay like a filthy leech exhausted with his depletion
i shuddered as i bent over to touch him and every sense in her evolved at the contact but i had to search or i was lost
the coming night might see my own body a banquet in a similar war to those horrid three
i felt all over the body but no sign could i find of the key
then i stopped and looked at the count
there was a mocking smile on the bloated face which seemed to drive me mad
this was the being i was helping to transfer to london where perhaps for centuries to come he might amongst its teeming millions satiate his lust for blood and create a new and ever widening circle of semi demons to batten on the help less
the very thought drove me mad
a terrible desire came upon me to rid the work for such a monster
there was no lethal weapon at hand but i seized a shovel which the workmen had been using to fill the cases and lifting it high struck with the edge downward at the hateful face
but as i did so the head turned and the eyes fell upon me with all their blaze of basilisk horror
the sight seemed to paralyze me and the shovel turned in my hand and glanced from the face merely making a deep gash above the forehead
the shovel fell from my hand across the box and as i pulled it away the flange of the blade caught the edge of the lid which fell over again and hiv the horrid thing from my sight
the last glimpse in areas of the bloated face blood stained and fixed with a grin of malice which would have held its own in the nether most hell
i thought and thought what should be my next move but my brain seemed on fire and i waited with a despairing feeling growing over me
as i waited i heard in the distance a gypsy song sung by jerry voices coming closer and through their so by the rolling of heavy wheels and the cracking of whips
the san any and the slovaks of whom the count had spoken were coming
with a last look around and at the box which contained the file boat iran from the place and gained the count's room determined to rush out at the moment the door should be opened
with strains sears i listened and heard downstairs the grinding of the key in the great lock and the falling back of the heavy door
there must have been some other means of entry of someone had a key for one of the locked doors
then there came the sound of many feet tramping and dying away in some passage which went up a clanging echo
i turned to run down again towards the vault where i might find the new entrance but at the moment there seemed to come a violent puff of wind and the door to the windings hair bows to with a shock that set the dust from the lintels flying
when i ran to push it open k found that it was hopelessly fast
i was again a prisoner and the net of doom was closing round me more closely
as i write there is in the passage below a sound of many tramping feet and the crash of weights being set down heavily doubtless the boxes with their freight of earth
there was a sound of hammering
it is the box being nailed down
now i can hear the heavy feet tramping again along the hall with many other idle feet coming behind them
the door is shut the chain seattle
there is a grinding of the key in the lock
i can hear the key withdrawn then another door opens and shuts
i hear the creaking of lock and bolt
mark
on the courtyard and down the rocky way the roll of heavy wheels the crack of whips and the chorus of the satan has they pass into the distance
i am alone in the castle with those horrible women
baugh
mina is a woman and the de la bought in common
they are devils of the pit
i shall not remain alone with them
i shall try to scale the castle wall farther than i have yet attempted
i shall take some of the cold with me lest i want it later
i may find away from this dreadful place
and then a way for home
a way to the quickest and nearest train
away from the cursed spot from this cursed land where the devil and his children still walk with earthly feet
at least god's mercy is better than that of those monsters and the precipice is steep and high
at its roots man may sleep as a man
goodbye all
mina
chapter letter from mix china murray to miss lucy westenra may
my dearest lucy forgive my long delay in writing but i have been simply overwhelmed with work
the life of an assistant school mistress is sometimes trying
i am logging to be with you and by the sea where we can talk together freely and build our castles in the air
i have been working very hard lately because i want to keep up with jonathan's studies and i have been practicing shorthand very assiduously
when we are married i shall be able to be useful to jonathan and if i can steno graph well enough i can take down what he wants to say in this way and write it out for him on the typewriter at which also i am practising very hard
he and i sometimes write letters in shorthand and he is keeping a stenographic journal of his travels abroad
when i am with you i shall keep a diary in the same way
idon't mean one of those two pages to the week with sunday squeezed in a corner diaries but a sort of journal which i can write in whenever i feel inclined
i do not suppose there will be much of interest to other people but it is not intended for them
i may show it to jonathan e. one day if there is in it anything worth sharing but it is really an exercise book
i shall try to do what i see lady journalists do interviewing and writing descriptions and trying to remember conversations
i am told that with a little practice one can remember all that goes on or that one hears said during a day
however we shall set
i will tell you of my little plans when we meet
i have just had a few hurried lines from jonathan from transylvania
he is well and will be returning in about a week
i am longing to hear all his news
it must be nice to see strange countries
i wonder if crimean jonathan and i shall ever see them together
there is the teno'clock bell ringing
goodbye
your loving mina tell me all the news when you write
you have not told me anything for a long time
i mrs r rumours and especially if at all handsome curly haired man
letter lucy westenra to mind murray chatham street wednesday my dearest mina i must say you had never y unfairly with being a bad correspondent
i wrote you twice since we parted and your last letter was only your second
besides i have nothing to tell you
there is really nothing to interest you
town is very pleasant just now and we go a great deal to picture galleries and for walks and rides in the park
as to the tall curly haired man i suppose it was the one who was with heat the last pop
someone has evidently been telling tales
that was mr.
holmwood
he often comes to see us and he and mamma get it very well together they have so many things to talk about in common
we met some time ago a man that would just do for you if you were not already engaged to jonathan
he is an excellent part i being handsome well off and of good birth
he is a doctor and really clever
just dandy
he is only nine and twenty and he has an immense lunatic asylum all under his own care
mr
holmwood introduced him to me and he called here to see us and often comes now
i think he is one of the most resolute menu ever saw and yet the most calm
he seems absolutely imperturbable
i can ranch what a wonderful power he must have over his patients
he has a curious habit of looking one straight in the face as if trying to read one's thoughts
he tries this on very much with me but i flatter myself he has got a tough nut to crack
i know that from my glass
do you ever try to read your own face
i do and i can tell you it is not a bad study and gives you more trouble than you can well fancy if you have never tried it
he says that i afford him a curious psychological study and i humbly think i do
i do not as you know take sufficient interest in dress to be able to describe the new fashions
dress is a bore
that is slang again but never mind
arthur says that every day
there it is all out mina we have told all our secrets to each other since we were children
we have slept together and eaten together and laughed and cried together and now though i have spoken i would like to speak more
luminacouldn't you guess
i love him
i am blushing as i write for although i think he loves me he has not told me so in words
but oh muna i love him
i love him
there that does me good
i wish i were with you dear sitting by the fire undressing as we used to sit and i would try to tell you what i feel
i do not know how i am writing this even to you
i am afraid to stop or i should tear up the letter and idon't want to stop for i do so want to tell you all
let me hear from you at once and tell me all that you think about it
mina pray for my happiness
lucy p

it was so nice to be able to tell you and to have your sympathy
my dear it never rains but it pours
how true the old proverb care
here ami who shall be twenty in september and yet i never had a proposal till today not a real proposal and today i had three
just fancy
three proposals in one day
isn't it awful
i feel sorry really and truly sorry for two of the poor fellows
lumina i am so happy that idon't know what to do with myself
and three proposals
but for goodness' sakedon't fell any of the girls or they would be getting all sorts of extravagant ideas and imagining themselves injured am delighted if in their very first day at home they did not get six at least
some girls are so vain
you and i'm in a dear who are engaged and are going to settle down soon soberly into old married women can realise vanity
well i must tell you about the three but you must keep in a secret dear from everyone except of course jonathan
you will tell him because i would obi were in your place certainly tell arthur
a woman ought to tell her husband everything
don't you think so dear
and i must be fair
men like women certainly their wives to be quite as fair as they are
and women i am afraid are not always quite as fair as they should be
well my dear number one came just before lunch
i told you of homer
john seward the lunatic asylum man with the strong jaw and the good forehead
he was very cool outwardly but was nervous all the same
he had evidently been schooling himself as to all sorts of little things and remembered them but he almost managed to sit down on his silk hat which mendon't generally do when they are cool and then when he wanted to appear at ease he kept playing with a lancet in a way that made me nearly scream
he spoke to men in a very straightforward ly
he told me how dear i was to him though he had known me so little and what his life would be with me to help and cheer him
he was going to tell me how unhappy he would be if i did not care for him but when he saw me cry he said he was a brute and would not add to my present trouble
then he broke off and asked if i could love him in time and when i shook my head his hands trembled and then with some hesitation he asked me if i cared already for anyone else
he put it very nicely saying that he did not want to wring my confidence from me but only to know because of a woman's heart was free a man might have hope
and then mina i felt a sort of duty to tell him that there was someone
i only told him that much and then he stood up and he looked very strong and very grave as he took both my hands in his and said he hoped i would be happy and that if i ever sent as a friend i must count him one of my best
oh kinase as ican't help crying and you must excuse this letter being all blotted
being proposed to us all very nice and all that sort of thing but itisn'ta tall a happy thing when you have to see a poor fellow whom you know loves you honestly going away and looking all broken hearted and to know that no matter what he may say at the moment you are passing out of his life
my dear i must stop here at present i feel so miserable though i am so happy
evening
arthur has just gone and i feel in better spirits than when i left off so i can go on telling you about the day
well my dear number two came after lunch
he is such a nice fellow an american from texas and he looks so young and so fresh that it seems almost impossible that he has been to so many places and has such adventures
i sympathize with poor desdemona when she had such a stream poured in her ear even by a black man
i suppose that we women are such cowards that we think a man will save us from fears and we marry him
i know now what i would do it i were a man and wanted to make a girl love me
no idon't for there was mr.
morris telling us his stories and arthur never told any and yet
my dear i am somewhat previous
mr
quincy p
morris round me alone
it seems that a man always does find a girl alone
notedoesn't for arthur tried twice to make a chance and i helping him all i could i am not ashamed to say it now
i must tell you beforehand that mr.
morrisdoesn't always speaks lang that is to say he never does so to strangers or before them for he is really well educated and has exquisite manners but he found out that it amused me to hear him talk american slang and whenever i was present and there was no one to be shocked he said such funny things
i am afraid my dear he has to invent it all for it fits exactly into whatever else he has to say
but this is a way slang has
i do not know myself if i shall ever speak slang
i do not know if arthur likes it as i have never heard him use any as yet
well mr
morris sat down beside me and looked as happy and jolly as he could but i could see all the same that he was very nervous
he took my hand in his and said ever so sweetly
miss lucy i know i ain' t good enough to regulate the fixin's of your little shoes but i guess if you wait till you find a man that is you will go join them seven young women with the lamps when you quit
don't you just hitch up alongside of me and let us go down the long road together driving in double harness
well he did look so good humoured and so jolly that it didn't seem half so hard to refuse him as it did poorer
seward
so i said a slightly as i could that i did not know anything of bitching and that i wasn't broken to harness at all yet
then he said that he had spoken in a light manner and he hoped that if he has made a mistake in doing so on so grave so momentous an occasion for him i would forgive him
he really did look serious when he was saying it and i couldn' y help feeling a bit serious too i know mina you will think me a horrid flirt though icouldn't help feeling a sort of exultation that he was number two in one day
and then my dear before i could say a word he began pouring out a perfect torrent of lovemaking laying his very heart and soul at my feet
he looked so earnest over it that i shall never again think that a man must be playful always and never earnest because he is merry at times
i suppose he saw something in my face which checked him for he suddenly stopped and said with a sort of manly fervour that i could have loved him for if i had been free
lucy you are an honest hearted girl i know
i should not be here speaking to you asia know if i did not believe you clean grit right through to the very depths of your soul
tell me like one goodfellow to another is there anyone else that you care for
and if there is i'll never trouble you a hair's breadth again but will be if you will let me a very faithful friend
my dear mina why are men so noble when we women are so little worthy of them
here was i almost making fun of this great hearted true gentleman
i burst into tears i am afraid my dear you will think this a very sloppy letter in more ways than one and i really felt very badly
whycan't they let a girl march three men or as many as want her and save all this trouble
but this is heresy and i must not say it
i am glad to say that though i was crying i was able to look into me
morris' brave eyes and i told him out straight
yes there is someone i love though he has not told me yet that he even loves me
i was right to speak to him so frankly for quite a light came into his face and he put out both his hands and took mine i think i put them into his and said in a hearty way
that's my brave girl
it's better worth being late for a chance of winning you than being in time for any other girl in the world
don't cty my dear
if it's for mei'ma hard nut to crack and i take it standing up
if that other fellowdoesn't know his happiness well he'd better look for it soon or he'll have to deal with me
little girl your honesty and pluck have made me a friend and that's rarer than a loved it's more selfish anyhow
my dear i'm going to have a pretty lonely walk between this and kingdom come
don't you give me one kiss
it'll be something to keep off the darkness now and then
you can you know if you like for that other goodfellow he must be a good fellow my dear and a fine fellow or you could not love him iwan't spoken yet
that quite winme mins for it was brave and sweet of him and noble too to a rivalwasn'ti t
and he so sad so i leant over and kissed him
he stood up with my two hands in his and as he looked down into my face i am afraid i was blushing very much he said little girl i hold your hand and you've kissed me and if these thingsdon't make us friend's nothing ever will
thank you for your sweet honesty tome and goodbye
hedging my hand and taking up his hat went straight out of the room without looking back without a year or a quiver of a pause and i am crying like a baby
oh why just a man like that be made unhappy when there are lots of girls about who would worship the very ground metro don
i know i would if i were free only idon't want to be free
my dear this quite upset me and i feel i can not write of happiness just at once after telling you of it and idon't wish to tell of the number three until it can be all happy
every our loving
lucy p
s
oh about number three i needn't tell you of number three need i
besides it was all so confused
it seemed only a moment from his coming into the room till both his arms were found me and he was kissing me
i am very very happy and idon't know what i have done to deserve it
i must only try in the future to show that i am not ungrateful to god for all his goodness to me in sending to me such a lover such a husband and such a friend
goodbye

seward's diary kept in phonograph may
ebb tide in appetite today
can not eat can not rest so diary instead
since my rebuff of yesterday i have a sort of empty feeling
nothing in the world seems of sufficient importance to be worth the doing
as i knew that the only cure for this sort of thing was work i went amongst the patients
i picked out one who has afforded me a study of much interest
he is so quaint that i am determined to understand him as well as i can
today i seemed to get nearer than ever before to the heart of his mystery
i questioned him more fully than i had ever done with a view to making myself master of the facts of his hallucination
in my manner of doing it there was in la see something of cruelty
i seemed to wish to keep him to the point of his madness a thing which i avoid with the patients as i would the mouth of hell
men
under what circumstances would i not avoid the pit of hell
omni aroma even a loss unt
hell has its price
if there be anything behind this instinct it will be valuable to trace it afterwards accurately so i had better commence to do so therefore
r
mr. enfield age
sanguine temperament great physical strength morbidly excitable periods of gloom ending in some fixed idea which i can not make out
i presume that the sanguine temperament itself and the disturbing influence end in a mentally accomplished finish a possibly dangerous man probably dangerous if unselfish
in selfish mem caution is as secure an armour for their does as for themselves
what i think of on this point is when self is the fixed point the centripetal force is balanced with the centrifugal
when duty a cause etc.
is the fixed point the latter force is paramount and only accident or a series of accidents can balance it

art chapter mina murray's journal july
whitby
lucy met me at the station looking sweeter and lovelier than ever and we drove up to the house at the crescent in which they have rooms
this is a lovely place
the little river thee so runs through a deep valley which broadens out as it comes near the harbour
a great viaduct runs across with high piers through which the view seems somehow further away than it really is
the valley is beautifully green and it is so steep that when you are on the highland on either side you look right across it unless you are near enough to see down
the houses of the old town the side away from us are all red roof ed and seem piled up one over the other anyhow like the pictures we see of nuremberg
right over the town is the ruin of whitby abbey which was sacked by the danes and which is the scene of part of marmion where the girl was built up in the wall
it is a most noble ruin of immense size and full of beautiful and romantic bits
there is a legend that a white lady is seen in one of the windows
between it and the town there is another church the parish one round which is a big graveyard all full of tombstones
this is to my mind the nicest spot in whitby for it lies right over the town and has a full view of the harbour and all up the bat to where the headland called kettle news stretches out into the sea
it descends so steeply over the harbour that part of the bank has fallen away and some of the graves have been destroyed
in one place part of the stonework of the graves stretches out over the sandy pathway far below
there are walks with seats beside them through the churchyard and people go and sit there all day long looking at the beautiful view and enjoying the breeze
i shall come and sit here often myself and work
indeed i am writing now with my book on my knee and listening to the talk of three old men who are sitting beside me
they seem to do nothing all day but sit here and talk
the harbour lies below me within the far side one long granite wall stretching out into the sea with a curve outwards at the end of it in the middle of which is a lighthouse
a heavy seas all runs along outside of it
on the nearside the seawall makes an elbow crooked inversely and its end to it as a lighthouse
between the two piers there is a narrow opening into the harbour which then suddenly widens
it is nice at high water but when the tide is out its goals away fotothing and there is merely the stream of the esl running between banks of sand with rocks here and there
outside the harbour on this side there rises for about half smile a great reef the sharp of which runs straight out from behind the south lighthouse
at the end of it is a buoy with a bell which swings in bad weather and sends in a mournful sound on the wind
they have a legend here that when a smilie list below are heard out at sea
i must ask the old man about this
he is coming this way
he is a funny old man
he must be awfully old for his face is gnarled and twisted like the bark of a tree
he tells me that he is nearly a hundred and that he was a sailor in the greenland fishing fleet when waterloo was bought
he is i am qvga is a very sceptical person for when i asked him about the bells at sea and the white lady at the abbey he said very brusquely i wouldn' trash madel' about them miss
then things be all wore out
mind idon't say that they never saw but i do say that theywasn'ti h my time
they be all very well for comers and triplets an' the like but not for a nice young lady like you
them feet folks from york and leeds that he always eatin' cited herein's and drinkin' tea an' lookin' out to buy cheap jet would creed sight
i wonder madel' who'd be bothered tellin' lies to them even the newspapers which is full of tooltalk
i thought he would be a good person to learn interesting things from so i asked him if he would mind telling me something about the whale fishing in the old days
he was just settling himself to begin when the clock struck six whereupon he laboured to get up and said i must gay gay dean ward's home now kiss
my granddaughterdoesn't like to be kept waitin' when the tea is ready for it takes me time to crank lesbo on the trees for the debra many of' em and his si lack belly timber sale in by the clock
he hobbled away and i could see him hurrying as well as he could down the steps
the steps are a great feature on the place
they lead from the town to the church there are hundreds of them i do not know how many and they wind up in a delicate curve
the slope is so gentle that a horse could easily walk up and down the m
i think they must originally have had something to do with the abbey
i shall go home top
lucy went out visiting with her mother and as they were only duty calls i did not go
august
i came up here an hour ago with lucy and we have most interesting talk with my old friend and the two others who always come and join him
he is evidently the air oracle of them and i should think must have been in his time a most dictatorial person
he will not admit anything and down faces everybody
if hecan't out argue then he bullies them and then takes their silence for agreement with his views
lucy was looking sweetly pretty in her white lawn brock
she has got a beautiful colour since she has been here
i noticed that the old men did not lose any time incoming and sitting near her when we sat apr n
she is so sweet with old people i think they all fell in love with her on the spot
even my old man succumbed and did not contradict her but gave me double share instead
i got him on the subject of the legends and he went off at once into a sort of sermon
i must try to remember it and put it down
it be all tooltalk lock stock and barrel that's what it be and hostels e
these bags an' watts an' bout hosts an' bar guests an' bogle's an' all agent them is only fit to set hair mean' dizzy womens' b elder in'
they be most but air blend
that an' all trims an' signs an' warn in'd be all invented by parsons an' i'll some very bodies an' railway routers to a keegan's dinner hagelin's an' to get folks to do somethin' that theydon't other incline to
it makes me i get up to think o' them
why it's them that not content with print in' lies on paper an' preachin' them out of pulpits does want to be cuttin' them on the tombstones
look here all around you in what sort he will
all the mate and holdin' up their heads as well as they can out of their pride is a cant simply tumblin' down with the weightl' the lies wrote on them' here lies the body' or' sacred to the memory' wrote on all of the man' yet in high half of them there be an' t nobodies at allah' the memories of them been' t cared a pinch of snuff about much less sacred
lies all of them nothin' but lies of one kind of another
my big but it'll be squares cow ferment at the day of judgment when they come tumblin' up in their deaths arms all joules together an' trying' to drag their tombs teams with them to prove how good they was some of them frinklin' an' dithering with their hands that do szeged an' slippery from lyin' on the sea that theycan't even keep their fur po' them
i could see from the old fellow's self satisfied air and the way in which he looked round for the approval of his cronies that he was showing off so i put in a word to keep him going
oh mr
e wales you can' the serious
surely these tombstones are not all wrong
gay blind
there may be a poor is grew not wrong savin' where they make out the people too good for there be folk that do think a balm bowl be like the sea if only it be their own
the whole thing he only lies
now look you here
you come here a stranger an' you see this kirk garth
i nodded for i thought it better to assent though i did not quite understand his dialect
i knew it had something to do with the church
he went on and you cons are that all these are and be a boon folk that behalf where's no dan's not
i assented again
then that he just where the kit comes in.
why there be scores of the delay beds that he took a cold sun's' bass a box on friday night
he judged one of his companions and they all laughed
and myron
how could they be otherwise
look at that one these tests fact the bird bank read it
i went over and read edward spence path master mariner murdered by pirates off the coast of andrew april age
when i came back mr
swales went on who brought him home i wonder total him here
murdered off the coast of andres
an' you con dated his body lay under
why i could name yes dozen whose bones lie in the greenland seas above he pointed northwards or where the currants may have drifted them
there be the strand around us
he can with your young eyes read the small print of the lies from here
this gral the site lowery i knew his father lost in the lively off greenland in' or andrew woodhouse drowned in the same season of john paxton drowned off cape farewell a year later or old john rawlings whose grandfather sailed with me drowned in the gulf of finland in'
do ye think that all these men will have to make a rush to whitby when the trumpet sounds
i have meant he runs about it
i tell ye that when they got here they'd be jimmi in' and most lib' one another that way that it' i'd be like a fight upon the use in the old days when we'd be at one another from daylight to dark an' tryin' to tie up our cuts by the aurora borealis
this was evidently local pleasantry for the old man cackled over it and his cronies joined in with gusto
but i said surely you are not quite correct for you start in the assumption that all the poor people of their spirits will have to take their tombstones with them on the day of judgment
do you think that will be really necessary
well what else be they tombstones for
answer me that miss
to please their relatives i suppose
to please their relatives you suppose
this be said with intense scorn
how will it pleasure their relatives to know that lies is wrote over them and that everybody in the place knows that they belies
he pointed to a stone at our feet which had been laid down as a slab on which the seat was tested close to the edge of the cliff
read the loss on that the itc stone he said
the letters were upside down to me from where i sat but lucy was more opposite to them so she leant over and read sacred to the memory of george canon who died in the hope of a glorious resurrection on july falling from the rocks at kettle news
this tomb was erected by his sorrowing mother to her dearly beloved son
' he was the only son of his mother and she was a widow
' really mr
swales idon't see anything very funny in that
she spoke her comment very gravely and somewhat severely
hedon't see aug be funny
na na
but that's because hedon't gawk the sorrow in' mother was a hellcat that hates him because he was a creek's a regular la miter he was an' he hated her so that he committed suicide in order that she mightn't get an insurance she put on his life
he blew night he top of his head off with an old musket that they had ford car in' cross with
' twarn't for cross then for it brought the c legs and the fowls to him
that's the way he fell off the rocks
and as to hopes of a glorious resurrection i've often heard him say madel' that he hoped he'd go to hell for his mother was copious that she'd be sure to go to heaven an' he didn't want to a self where she was
nowisn't that's team at any rate he hammered it with his stick as he spoke a lack of lies
andwon't it make gabrielle cope when geordie comes paid in' if the trees with the t pm pst sat balanced on his hump and asks to be took as evidence
i did not know what to say but lucy turned the conversation as she said rising up on why did you tell us of this
it is my favourite seat and i can not leave it and now i find l must go on sitting over the grave of a suicide
that won' that my e my pretty an' it may make poor geordie glad come to have corrimal ass sittin' on his lap
thatdon'tu if the
why i've sat here off an' on for high twenty years past an' it hasn't done me no harm
don' the task about them as lies under he or that doesn' lie there either
it'll be time for us to be getting scary when ye see the tombs trans all run away with and the place as bassa da stubblefield
there's the clock and i must gang
my service toys ladies
and of the hobbled
lucy and is a tactile and it was all so beautiful before us that we took hands as we sat and she told me all over again about arthur and their coming marriage
that made me just a little heartsick for i haven't heard from jonathan for a whole month
the same day
i came up here alone for i am very sad
there was no letter for me
i hope there can not be anything the matter with jonathan
the clock has just struck none
i see the lights scattered all over the town sometimes in rows where the streets are and sometimes singly
they run right up the esl and die away in the curve of the valley
to my left the view is cut off by a black line of roof of the old house next to the abbey
the sheep and lambs are bleating in the fields away behind me and there is a clatter of donkeys' holds up the paved road below
the band on the pier is playing a harsh waltz in good time and further along the quay there is a salvation army meeting in a backstreet
belt bag of the bands hears the other but up here i hear and see them both
i wonder where jonathan is and if he is thinking of me
i wish he were here

seward's diary june
the case of renfield grows more interesting the more i get to understand the man
he has certain qualities very largely developed selfishness secrecy and purpose
i wish i could get at what is the object of the latter
he seeks to have some settled scheme of his own but what it is i do not know
his redeeming quality is a love of animals though indeed he has such curious turns unit that i sometimes imagine he is only abnormally cruel
his pet care of odd sort s
just now his hobby is catching flies
he had at present such a quantity that i have had myself to ex postulate
to my astonishment he did not break out into a fury as i expected but took the matter in simple seriousness
he thought for a moment and then said may i have three days
i shall clear them away
of course i said that could do
i just watch him
june
he has turned his mind how to spiders and has got several very big fellows in a box
he keeps feeding them his flies and the number of the latter is becoming sensibly diminished although he has used half his food in attracting more flies from outside to his room
july
his spiders are now becoming as great a nuisance as his flies and today i told him that he must get rid of them
he looked very sad at this so i said that he just some of them at all events
he cheerfully acquiesced in this and i gave him the same time as before for reduction
he disgusted me much while with him for when a horrid blowfly bloated with some carrion food buzzed into the room he caught it held it exultant it for a few moments between his finger and thumb and before i knew what he was going to do put it in his mouth and ate it
i scolded him for it but he argued quietly that it was very good and very wholesome that it was livestrong love and gave life to him
this gave me an idea of the rudi ment of one
i must watch how he gets rid of his spiders
he has evidently some deep problem in his mind for he keeps a little notebook in which he is always jotting down something
whole pages of it are filled with masses of figures generally single numbers added up in batches and then the totals added in batches again as though he were focussing some account as the auditors put it
july
there is a method in his madness and the rudimentary idea in my mind is growing
it will be a whole idea soon and then on unconscious cereb ration you will have to give the wall to your conscious brother
i kept away from my friend for a few days so that i might notice if there were any change
things remain as they were except that he has parted with some of his pets and got a new one
he has managed to get a sparrow and has already partially takes it
his means of gaming is simple for already the spiders have diminished
those that do remain however are well fed to the still brings in the blues by tempting them with his food
july we are progressing
my friend has now a whole colony of sparrows and his flies and spiders are almost obliterated
when i came in her an tome and said he wanted to ask me a great favour a very very great favour
and as he spoke he dawned on me like a dog
i asked him what it was and he said with a sort of rapture in his voice and bearing a kitten a nice little sleek playful kitten that i can play with and teach and feed and feed and feed
i was not unprepared for this request for i had noticed how his pets went on increasing in size and vivacity but i did not care that his pretty family of fame sparrows should be wiped out in the same manner as the flies and spiders
so i said i would see about it and asked him if he would not rather have a cat than a kitten
his eagerness betrayed him as he answered oh yes i would like a cat
i only asked for a kitten lest you should refuse me a cat
no one would refuse me a kitten would they
i shook my head and said that at present i feared it would not be possible but that i would see about it
his face fell and i could see a warning of danger in it for there was a sudden fierce side long look which meant killing
the man is an undeveloped homicidal maniac
i shall test him with his present craving and see how it will work out the uk shall know more
pm
i have visited him again and found him sitting in a corner brooding
when i came in. he threw himself on his knees before me and implored me to let him have a cat that his salvation depended upon it
i was firm however and told him that he could not have it whereupon he went without a word and sat down gnawing his fingers on the corner where i had found him
i shall see him in the morning early
july
visited renfield very early before attendant went his rounds
found him up and humming a tune
he was spreading out his sugar which he had saved in the window and was manifestly beginning his fly catching again and beginning it cheerfully and with a good grace
i looked around for his birds and not seeing them asked him where they were
he replied without turning round that they had all blown away
there were a few feathers about the room and on his pillow a drop of books
i said nothing but went and told the keeper to report to me if there were anything odd about him during the day
am
the attendant has just been to see me to say that renfield has been very sick and has distorted a whole lot of feathers
my belief is doctor he said that he has eaten hiscores and that he just took and ate them raw
pm
i have renfield a strong opiate tonight enough to make even him sleep and took away his pocket book to look at it
the thought that has been buzzing about my brain lately is complete and the theory prover
my homicidal maniac is of a peculiar kind
i shall have to invent a new classification for him and call him a zoo pharoh's life eating maniac
what he desires is to absorb as many lives as he can and he had laid himself out to achieve it in a cumulative way
he gave many flies to one spider and many spiders no one bird and then wanted a cattle at the many birds
what would have been his later steps
it would almost be worthwhile to complete the experiment
it might be done if there were only a sufficient cause
men sneered at vivisection and yet look at its results today
why not advance science in its most difficult and vital aspect the knowledge of the brain
had i even the secret of one such mind did i hold the key to the fancy or even one lunatic i might advance my own branch of science to a pitch compared with which burdon sanderson's physiology or terrier's brain knowledge would be as nothing
if only there were a sufficient cause
i just not think too much of this or i may be tempted
a good cause might turn the scale with me for may not it lobe of an exceptional brain congenitally
how well the man reasoned
lunatics always do within their own scope
i wonder at how many lives he values a man or if at only one
he has closed the account most accurately and today begun a new record
how many of us begin a new record with each day of our lives
to be it seems only yesterday that my whole life ended with my new hope and that truly i began a new record
so it shall be until the great recorder sums me up and closed my ledger account with a balance to profit or loss
oh lucy lucy i can not be angry with you nor can i be angry with my friend whose happiness is yours but i must only wait on hopeless and work
work
work
if i could have as strong a cause as my poor had friend there a good unselfish cause to make me work that would be indeed happiness
mina murray's journal july
i am anxious and it soothes me to express myself here
it is like whispering to one's self and listening at the same time
and there is also something about the shorthand symbols that makes it different from writing
i am unhappy about lucy and about jonathan
i had not heard from jonathan for some time and was very concerned but yesterday dear mr.
hawkins who is always so kind sent me a letter from him
i had written asking him if he had heard and he said the enclosed had just been received
it is only a line dated from castle dracula and says that he is just starting for home
that is not like jonathan
i do not understand it and it makes me uneasy
then too lucy although she is so well has lately taken to her old habit of walking in her sleep
her mother has spoken to me about it and we have decided that i am to lock the door of our room every night
mrs
westenra has got an idea that sleepwalkers always go out on roofs of houses and along the edges of cliffs and then get suddenly wakened and fall over with a despairing cry that echoes all over the place
poor dear she is naturally anxious about lucy and she tells me that her husband lucy's father had the same habit that he would get up in the night and dress himself and go out if he were not stopper
lucy is to be married in the autumn and she is already planning out her dresses and how her house is to be arranged
i sympathise with her for i do the same only jonathan and i will start in life in a very simple way and shall have to try to make both ends meet
mr
holmwood he is the hon
arthur holmwood only son of lord godalming is coming up here very shortly as soon as he can leave town for his father is not very well and i think dear lucy is counting the moment still becomes
she wants to take him up in the seat on the churchyard cliff and shown in the beauty of whitby
i dare say it is the waiting which disturbs her
she will be all right when he arrives
july
no news from jonathan
i am getting quite uneasy about him though why i should i do not know but i do wish that he would write if it were only a single line
lucy walks more than ever and each night i am awakened by her moving about the room
fortunately the weather is so hot that she can not get cold
but still the anxiety and the perpetually being awakened is beginning to tellin me and i am getting nervous and wakeful myself
thank god lucy's health keeps up
mr
holmwood has been suddenly called to ring to see his father who has been taken seriously ill
lucy frets at the postponement of seeing him but it does not touch her looks
she is a trifle stouter and her cheeks are a lovely rose pink
she has lost the anemic look which she had
i pray it will all last
august
another week gone by and no news from jonathan not even tone
hawkins from whom i have heard
oh i do hope he is not llp
he surely would have written
i look at that last letter of his but somehow it does not satisfy me
it does not read like him and yet it is his writing
there is no mistake of that
lucy has not walked much in her sleep the last week but there is an odd concentration about her which i do not understand even in her sleep she seems to be watching me
she tries the door and finding it locked goes about the room searching for the key
august
another three days and no news
this suspense is getting dreadful
if i only knew where to write to or where to go to i should feel easier
but noone has heard a word of jonathan since that last letter
i must only pray to god for patience
lucy is more excitable than ever but is otherwise well
last night was very threatening and the fishermen say that we are in for a storm
i must try to watch it and learn the weather signs
today is a gray day and the sun as i write is hidden in thick clouds high over kettle need
everything is gray except the green grass which seems like emerald amongst it gray earthy rock gray clouds to nerv with the sunburst at the far edge hangover the gray sea into which the sand points stretch like gray figures
the sea is tumbling in over the shallows and the sandy flats with a road muffled in the sea mist adrift in finland
the horizon is lost in a gray mist
all vastness the clouds are piled up like giant rocks and there is a' brook' over the sea that sounds like some passage of doom
dark figures are on the beach here and there sometimes half shrouded in the mist and seem' men like trees walking'
the fishing boats are facing for home and rise and dip in the grounds well as they sweep into the harbour bending to the scullers
here comes old mr.
's wales
he is making straight for me and i can see by the way he lifts his hat that he wants to talk
i have been quite touched by the change on the poor old man
when he sat down beside me he said in a very gentle way i want to say something to you miss
i could see he was not at ease so i took his poor old wrinkled hand in mind and asked him to speak fully
so he said leaving his hand on mine i'm afraid my geary that i must have shocked you by all the wicked things i've been sayin' about the dead and suchlike for weeks last but i didn' the anthem and i want yet i remember that when i'm gone
we aud folks that be raffled and with one foot an art their ok too aldon't altogether like to think of it and wedon't want to feels car to fit and that's why i've took to makin' light of it so that i'd cheer up my own heart abit
but lord love gem is slain' t afraid of dyin' not a bit only idon't want to die if i can help it
my time must be high at hand now for i fraud and a hundred years is too much for any man to expect
and i'm so big hit that the aid man is already a gettin' his scythe
he seeks an' the toutl' the habit of care in' about it all at once
the charts will way as they be used to
someday soon the angel of death will sound his trumpet for me
but don' the doo alan' greet my dear y
for he saw that i was crying if he should come this very night i'd not refuse to answer his call
for life be after all only a waitin' for somethin' else than what we're doin' and death be all that we can rightly depend on
but i'm content for it's comin' home my weary and comin' quick
it may be comin' while we be lookin' and wonderin'
maybe it's on that wind out over the sea that's bringin' with it lies and wreck and sore distress and sad hearts
look
look
he cried suddenly
there's something in that wind and in the toast be hint that sounds and looks and tastes and smells like death
it's in the air
i feel it comin'
lord make me answer cheerful when my call comes
he held up his arms devoutly and raised his hat
his mouth moved as though he were praying
after a few minutes' silence he got up shook hands with me and blessed me and said goodbye and hobbled off
it all touched me and upset me very much
i was glad when the coast guard came along with his spyglass under his arm
he stopped to talk with me as he always does but all the time kept looking at a strange ship
ican't make her out he said
she's a russian by the look other
but she's knocking about in the queerest way
shedoesn't know her mind a bit
she seems to see the storm coming butcan't decide whether to run up north in the open or to put in here
look there again
she is steered mighty strangely for shedoesn't mind the hand on the wheel changes about with every puff of wind
we'll hear more of her before this time tomorrow
chapter cutting from the daily graph august pasted in mina murray's journal from a correspondent
whitby
one of the greatest and sudden est storms on record has just been experienced here with results both strange and unique
the weather had been somewhat sultry but not to any degree uncommon in the month of august
saturday evening was as fine as was ever known and the great body of holiday makers laid out yesterday for visits to mulgrave woods robin hood's bay rig mill run swick staithes and the various trips in the neighborhood of whitby
the steamers emma and scarborough made trips up and down the coast and there was an unusual amount of' tripping' both to and from whitby
the day was unusually fine till the afternoon when some of the gossips who frequent the east cliff churchyard and from the commanding eminence watch the wide sweep of sea visible to the north and east called attention to a sudden show of' marestail's' high in the sky to the northwest
the wind was then blowing from the southwest on the mild degree which in barometric al language is ranked' no
light breeze
' the coast guard on duty at once made report an some old fisherman who for more than half a century has kept watch on weather signs from the east cliff foretold in an emphatic manner the coming of a sudden storm
the approach of sunset was so very beautiful so grab digits masses of splendidly coloured clouds that there was quite an assemblage on the walk along the cliff in the old church yard to enjoy the beauty
before the sun dipped below the black mass of kettle news standing boldly athwart the western sky its downward way was marked by myriad clouds of every sunset colour flame purple pink green violet and all the tints of gold with here and there masses not large but of seemingly absolute blackness in all sorts of shapes as well outlined as colossal silhouettes
the experience was not lost on the painters and doubtless some of the sketches of the' prelude to the great storm' will grace th fr
aan de
i
walls in may next
more than one captain made up his mind then and there that his' cobble' or his' mule' as they term the different classes of boats would remain in the harbour till the storm had passed
the wind fell away entirely during the evening and at midnight there was a dead calm a sultry heat and that prevailing intensity which on the approach of thunder affects persons of a sensitive nature
there were but few lights in sight at sea for even the coasting steamers which usually hug the shore so closely kept well to seaward and but few fishing boats were insight
the only sail noticeable was a foreign schooner with all sails set which was seemingly going westwards
the fool hardiness of ignorance other officers was a prolific theme for comment whilst she remained in sight and efforts were made to signal her to reduce sail in the face of her danger
before the night shutdown she was seen with sails idly flapping as she gently rolled on the undulating carol of the sea
as idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean
shortly before teno'clock the stillness of the air grew quite oppressive and the silence was so marked that the bleating of a sheep in land of the barking of a dog in the town was distinctly heard and the band on the pier with its lively french air was like a dischord in the great harmony of nature's silence
a little after midnight cake a strange sound from over the sea and high overhead the air began to carry a strange faint hollow booking
then without warning the tempest broke
with a rapidity which at the time seemed incredible and even afterwards is impossible to realize the whole aspect of nature at once became convulsed
the waves rose in growing fury each overtopping its fellow fill in a very few minutes the lately class uses was like a roaring and devouring monster
white created waves beat madly in the level sands and rushed up the shelving cliffs
others broke over the piers and with their spine swept the langhorne of the lighthouses which rise from the end of either pier of whitby harbour
the wind roared like thunder and blew with such force that it was with difficulty that even strong men kept their feet or clung with grin clasp to the iron stanchions
it was found necessary to clear the entire pier from the mass of onlookers or else the fatalities of the night would have increased manifold
to add to the difficulties and dangers of the time masses of sea for came drifting in land
white wet clouds which swept by in ghostly fashion so dank and damp and sold that it needed but little effort of imagination to think that the spirits of those lost at sea were touching their living brethren with the clam my hands of death and many a one shuddered as the wreaths of sea mist swept by
at times the most cleared and the sea for some distance could be seen in the glare of the lightning which came thick and fast followed by such peals of thunder that the whole sky overhead seemed trembling under the shock of the footsteps of the storm
some of the scenes this revealed were of immeasurable grandeur and of absorbing interest
the sea running mountains high threw skywards with each wave mighty masses of white foam which the tempest seemed to snatch at and whirl away into space
here and there a fishing boat with a day of sail running madly for shelter before the blast now and again the white wings of a storm tossed seabird
on the summit of the east cliff the new search light was ready for experiment but had not yet been tried
the officers in charge of it got it into working order and in the pauses of onrushing most swept with it the surface of the sea
once or twice its service was most effective as when a fishing boat with gunwale underwater rushed into the harbour able by the guidance of the sheltering light to avoid the danger of washing against the piers
as each boat achieved the safety of the port there was a shout of joy from the mass of people on the shore a shout which for a moment seemed to cleave the gale and was then swept away in its rush
before long the searchlight discovered some distance away a schooner with all sails set apparently the same vessel which had been notices earlier in the evening
the wind had by this time backer to the east and there was a shudder amongst the watchers on the cliff as they realized the terrible danger in which she now sas
between her and the port lay the great flag free on which so many good ships have from time to time suffered and with the wind blowing from its present quarter it would be quite impossible that she should fetch the entrance of the harbour
it was now nearly the hour of high tide but the waves were so great that in their troughs the shallows of the shore were almost visible and the schooner with all sails set was rushing with such speed that in the words of one old salt she must fetch up somewhere if it was only in hell
then came another rush of sea for greater than any hitherto a mass of rank most which seemed to close on all things like a gray oakland left available token only the organ of hearing for the roar of the tempest and the crash of the thunder and the booming of the mighty follows came through the camp oblivion even louder than before
the rays of the searchlight were kept fixed on the harbour mouth across the west pier where the shock was expected and men waited breathless
the wind suddenly shifted to the northeast and the remnant of the sea for melted in the blast
and then mira bile duct u between the piers leaping from wave to save as it rushed at headlong speed swept the strange schooner before the blast with all sail set and gained the safety of the harbour
the searchlight followed her and a shudder ran through all who saw her for lashed to the helm was a corpse with droppin these which swung horribly to and fro at each motion of the ship
no other form could be seen on the deck at all
a great as exams on all as they realised that the ship as if by a miracle had found the harbour in steered save by them and of a deadman
however all took place more quickly than it takes to write these words
the schooner paused not but rushing across the harbour pitched herself on that accumulation of sand and gravel washed by many tides and many storms into the southeast corner of the pier jutting under the east cliff known locally a state hill list
there was of course a considerable concussion as the vessel drove up on the sand trap
every spar rope and stay was strained and some of the' top hammer' came crashing down
but strangest of all the very instant the shore was touched an immense dog sprang up on deck from below as if shot up by the concussion and running forward jumped from the bow on the sand
making straight for the steep cliff where the church yard hangs over the land way to the east pier so steeply that some of the flat tombstones thrifts teams or through stones as they call them in whitby vernacular actually project over where the sustaining cliff has fallen away it disappeared in the darkness which seemed intensified just beyond the focus of the searchlight
it so happened that there was no one at the moment in rats hill pier as all those whose houses are in close proximity were either in bed or were out on the heights above
thus the coast guard on duty on the eastern side of the harbour who at once ran down to the little life was the first to climb aboard
the men working the searchlight after scouring the entrance of the harbour without seeing anything then turned the light on the derelict and kept it there
the coast guard fan art and when he came beside the wheel bent over to examine it and recoiled at once as though under some sudden emotion
this seemed to pique general cut ii city and quite a number of people began to run
it is a good way round from the westcliff by the drawbridge to rate hill pier but your correspondent is a fairly good runner and came well ahead of the crowd
when i arrived however i found already assembled on the pier a crowd whom the coast guard and police refused to allow to come on board
by the courtesy of the chief boatman i was as your correspondent permitted to climb on deck and was one of a small group who saw the dead sea jan whilst actually lashed to the wheel
it was no wonder that the coast guard was surprised or even a wed for not often can such a sight have been seen
the man was simply fastened by his hands tied one over the other to a spoke of the wheel
between the inner hand and the wood was a crucifix the set of beads on which it was fastened being around both wrists and wheel and all kept fast by the binding codes
the poor fellow may have been seated at one time but the flapping and buffering of the sails had worked through the rudder of the wheel and had dragged him to and fro so that the cords with which he was tied had cut the flesh to the bone
accurate note was made of the state of things and a doctor surgeon j
m
daffy not east elliot place who came immediately after he declared after making examination that the man must have been dead for quite two days
in his pocket was a bottle carefully corked empty save for a little roll of paper which proved to be the addendum to the log
the coast guard said the man must have tied up his own hands fastening the knots with his teeth
the fact that a coast guard was the first on board may save some complications later on in the admiralty court for coastguards can not claim the salvage which is the right of the first civilian entering on a derelict
already however the legal tongues are sagging and one young law student is loudly asserting that the rights of the owner are already completely sacrificed his property being held in contravention of the statues of mort main since the tiller as emblem ship if not proof of delegated possession is held in a dead hand
it is needless to say that the dead steers man has been reverently removed from the place where he held his honourable watch and ward till death a steadfastness as noble as that of the young casablanca and placed in the mortuary to await inquest
already the sudden storm is passing and its fierceness is abating
crowds are scattering backward and the sky is beginning to redden over the yorkshire wolds
i shall send in time for your next issue further details of the derelict ship which found her way so miraculously into harbour in the storm
august
the sequel to the strange arrival of the derelict in the storm last night is almost more startling than the thing itself
it turns out that the schooner is russian from varna and is called the demeter
she is almost entirely in ballast of silver sand with only a small amount of cargo a number of great wooden boxes filled with mould
this cargo was consigned to a whitby solicitor mr
s
f
billington of the crescent who this morning went aboard and took formal possession of the goods consigned to him
the russian consul too acting for the charter party took formal possession of the ship and paid all harbour dues etc.
nothing is talked about here today except the strange coincidence
the officials of the board of trade have been most exacting in seeing that every compliance has been made with existing regulations
as the matter is to be a' nine days wonder' they are evidently determined that there shall be no cause of other complaint
a good deal of interest was a crowe concerning the dog which landed when the ships truck and more than a few of the members of the s
p
c
a
which is very strong in whitby have tried to befriend the animal
to the general disappointment however it was not to be found
it seems to have disappeared entirely from the town
if maybe that it was frightened and made its way onto the holes where it is still hiding in terror
there are some who look with dread on such a possibility of st. later on it should in itself become a danger for it is evidently a fierce brute
early this morning a large dogs half free mastiff belonging to a coal merchant close to rate hill pier was found dead in the roadway opposite its master's yard
it had been fighting and manifestly had had a savage opponent for its throat was torn away and its belly was so it open as it with a savage claw
later
by the kindness of the board of trade inspector i have been permitted to look over the logbook of the demeter which was in order upto within three days buy contained nothing of special interest except as to facts of missing men
the greatest interest however is with regard to the paper found in the bottle which was today produced at the inquest
and a more strange narrative than the two between them unfold it has not been my lot to come across
as there is no motive for concealment i am permitted to use them and accordingly send you a transcript simply knitting technical details of seamanship and super cargo
it almost seems as though the captain had been seized with some kind of mania before he had not well info blue water and that this has developed persistently throughout the voyage
of course my statement must be taken cum frank since i am writing from the dictation of a clerk of the russian consul who kindly translated for me time being short
log of the demeter barns to whitby written july things so strange happening that i shall keep accurate note henceforth till we land
on july we finished taking in cargo silver sand and boxes of earth
at noon set sail
east wind fresh
crew five hands
two mates cook and myself captain

work of officers thorough but quick
want us off soon
at dark passed into archipelago
on july passed cape may span
crew dissatisfied about something
seemed scared but would not speak out
on july was somewhat anxious about crew
men all steady fellows who sailed with me before
mate could not make out what was wrong
they only told him there was something and crossed themselves
mate lost temper with one of them that day and struck him
expected fierce quarrel but all was quiet
on july mate reported in the morning that one of the crew petrovsky was missing
could not account for it
to polar board watch eight tells last night was relieved by amram off but did not go to bunk
kenmore downcast than ever
all said they expected something of the kind but would not say more than there was something a board
hate getting very impatient with them
feared some trouble ahead
on july yesterday one of the men olga ten came to my cabin and in an awestruck way confided to me that he thought there was a strange men aboard the shop
he said that in his watch he had been sheltering behind the deck house as there was a rainstorm when he saw a tall thin man who was not like any of the crew come up the companionway and go along the deck forward and disappear
he followed cautiously but when he got to bows found no one and the hatch ways were all closed
he was in a panic of superstitious fear and i am afraid the panic may spread
to allay it is hall today search the entire ship carefully from stem to stern
later in the day i got together the whole crew and told them as they evidently thought there was someone in the ship we would search from stem to stern
first mate angry said it was folly and to yield to such foolish ideas would de moral use the men said he would engage to keep them out of trouble with the hands pike
i let him take the helm while the rest began a thorough search all keeping abreast with lanterns
we left no corner unsearched
as there were only the big wooden boxes there were goods corners where a man could hide
men much relieved when search over and went back to work cheerfully
first mate scowled but said nothing
july
rough weather last three days and all hands busy with sails no time to be frightened
men seem to have forgotten their dread
matt cheerful again and a lion good terms
oral sex men for work in bad weather
passed gibraltar and out through straits
all well
july
there seems some room over this shop
already a hand short and entering the bay of biscay with wild weather ahead and yet last night another man lost disappeared
like the first he came off his watch and was not seen again
men all in a panic of fear sent a round robin asking to have double watch as they fear to be alone
matt angry
fear there will be some trouble as either he or the men will do some violence
july
four days in hell knocking about in a sort of maelstrom and the winds tempest
no sleep for anyone
men all worn out
hardly know how to set a watch since no one fit to go on
second mate volunteered to steer and watch and let men snatch a few hours sleep
wind abating seas still terrific but feel them less as ship is steadier
july
another tragedy
had single watch tonight as crew too tired to double
when morning watch came on deck could find no one except steers man
raised outcry and all came on deck
thorough search but no one round
are now without second mate and crew in a panic
mate and i agreed to go armed henceforth and wait for any sign of cause
july
last night
rejoiced we are nearing england
weather find all sails set
retired without slept soundly awakened by mate telling me that both major watch and steers man missing
only self and mate and two hands left to workshop
august
two days of fog and not as all sighted
had hoped when in the english channel to be able to signal for help or get in somewhere
not having power to work sails have to run before wind
dare not lower as could not raise them again
we seem to be drifting to some terrible room
mate now more demoralised than either of men
g is stronger nature seems to have worked inwardly against himself
men are beyond fear working still fly and patiently with minds made up to worst
they are russian he roumania n
august midnight
woke up from few minutes sleep by hearing a cry seemingly outside my port
could see nothing in for
rushed on deck and ran against mate
tells me he heard cry and ran but no sign of man on watch
one more none
lord help us
mate says we must be past straits of dover as in a moment of fog lifting me saw north foreland just as he heard the man cry out
if so we are now off in the north sea and only god can guide us in the fog which seems to move with us and god seems to have deserted us
august
at midnight i went to relieve the man at the wheel and when i got to it found no one there
the wind was steady and as we ran before it there was not swing
i dared not leave it so shouted for the mate
after a few seconds he rushed upon deck in his flannels
he looked wild eyes and haggard and i greatly fear his season has given way
he came close to me and whispered hoarsely with his mouth to my ear as though fearing the very air might hear
it is here
i know it now
on the watch last night i saw it like a man tall and thin and ghastly pale
it was in the bows and looking out
i crept behind it and gave it myob one but the knife went through it empty as the air
and as he spoke he took the knife and drove it savagely into space
then he went on but it is here and i'll find it
it is in the hold perhaps in one of those boxes
i'll unscrew the mine by one and see
you work the helm
and with a warning look and his finger on his lip he went below
there was springing up a choppy wind and i could not leave the tein
i saw him come out on deck again with a tool chest and lantern and go down the forward hatchway
he is mad stark raving mad and it's house my trying to stop him
hecan't hurt those big boxes they are involved as clay and to pull them about us as harmless a thing as he can do
so here i stay and mind the helm and write these notes
i can only trust in god and wait till the fog clears
then if ican't steer to any harbour with the wind that is i shall cut down sails and piety and signal for help
it is nearly all over now
just as i was beginning to hope that the mate would come out calmer for i heard him knocking away at something in the gold and work is good for him there came up the hatchway a sudden startled scream which made my blood run cold and upon the deck he came as if shot from a run a raving mad man with his eyes rolling and his face convulsed with fear
save me
save me
he cried and then looked round on the blanket of fog
his horror turned to despair and in a steady voice he said you had better come too captain before it is too late
he is there
i know the secret now
the sea will save me from him and it is all that is left
before i could say a word or move forward to seize him he sprang on the bulwark and deliberately threw himself into the sea
i suppose i know the secret to know
it was this madman who had got rid of the men one by one and now he had followed them himself
god help me
how amigo account for all these horrors when i get to port
when i get to port
will that ever be
august
still for which the sunrise can not pose cw i know there is sunrise because i am a sailor why else i know not
i dared not go below i dared not leave the helm so here all night i stayed and in the dimness of the night is a within
god forgive me but the mate was right to jump over board
it was better to die like a man
to die like a sailor in blue water mom and an object
but i am captain and i just not leave my shop
but i shall baffle this blend of monster for i shall tie my hands to the wheel when my strength begins to fail and along with them i shall tie that which he its are not touch
and then some good wind or foul i shall save my soul and my honour as a captain
i am growing weaker and the night is coming on
if he can look melt the face again i may not have time to act
if we are wrecked mayhap this bottle may be found and those who find it may understand
if not
well then all men shall know that i have been true to my trust
god and the blessed virgin and the saints help apo or ignorant soul trying to do his duty
ofcourse the verdict was an open one
there is no evidence to adduce and whether or not the man himself committed the murders there is now gone to say
the folk here hold almost universally that the captain is simply a hero and he is to be given a public funeral
already it is arranged that his body is to be taken with a train of costs up the esl for a piece and then brought back to rate hill pier and up the abbey steps for he is to be buried in the churchyard on the cliff
the owners of more than a hundred boats have already given in their names as wishing to follow him to the grave
no trace has ever been found of the great dog at which there is much mourning for with public opinion in its present state he would i believe be adopted by the town
tomorrow will see the funeral and so will end this one more' mystery of the sea'
mina murray's journal august
lucy was very restless all night and i too could not sleep
the storm was fearful and as it booked loudly among the chimney pots it made me shudder
when a sharp puff came it seemed to be like a distant gun
strangely enough lucy did not wake but she got up twice and dressed herself
fortunately each time i awoke in time and managed to undress her without waking her and got her back to bed
it is a very strange thing this sleepwalking for as soon as her willis thwarted in any physical way her intention if there be any disappears and she yields herself almost exactly to the routine of her life
early in the morning we both got up and went down to the harbour to see if anything had happened in the night
there were very few people about and though the sun was bright and the air clear and treat the big grin looking waves that seemed dark themselves because the foam that topped them was like snow coffee themselves in through the mouth of the harbour like a bullying may going through a crowd
somehow i felt glad that jonathan was not on the sea last night bit on land
but it is he inland or sea
where is he and how
i am getting fearfully anxious about him
if i only knew what to go and could do anything
august
the funeral of the poor sea captain today was most touching
every boat in the harbour seemed to be there and the coffin was carried by captain's all the way from date hill pier up to the churchyard
lucy came with me and we went early to our old seat whilst the cortege of boats went up the river to the viaduct and came down again
we had a lovely view and saw the procession nearly all the way
the poor fellow was laid forest near our seat so that we stood on it when the time came and saw everything
poor lucy seemed much upset
she was restless and uneasy all the time and i can not but think that her dreaming at night is telling on her
she is quite odd in one thing
she will not admit to me that there is any cause for restlessness or if the genes he does not under stand it herself
there is an additional cause in that poor mr.
's wales was found dead this morning on our dear his neck being broken
he had evidently as the doctor said fallen back in the seat in some sort off right for there was a look of fear and horror on his face that the men said made them shudder
poor dear old man
lucy is so sweet and sensitive that she feels influences more acutely than other people do
just now she was quite upset by a little thing which i did not much need though i am myself very fond of animals
one of the men who came up here often to look for the boats was followed by his dog
the dog is always with him
they are both quiet persons and i never saw them an angry not heard the dog bark
during the service the dog would not come to items star who was on the seat with us buy kept a few yards off farming and howling
it's master spoke to it gently and then harshly and then angrily
but it would neither come not cease to make a noise
it was in a fury with its eyes savage and all its half bristling out like a cat's tail when phasis on the warpath
finally the man too got angry and jumped down and kicked the dog and then took it by the scruff of the neck and half dragged and half threw it on the tombstone on which the seat is fixed
the moment it touched the stone the poor thing began to tremble
it did not try to get away but crouched down quivering and cowering and was in such a pitiable state of terror that i tried though without effect to comfort or
lucy was full of pity too but she did not attempt to touch the dog but looked at it in an agonised sort of way
i greatly fear that she is of too super sensitive a nature to go through the world without trouble
she will be dreaming of this tonight i am sure
the whole agglomeration of things the ship steered into port by a dead man his attitude tied to the wheel with a crucifix and beads the touching funeral the dog now furious and now in terror will all afford material for her dreams
i think it will be best for her to go to be stored out physically so i shall take her for a long walk by the cliffs to robin hood's bay and back
she ought not to have much uncon nation for sleepwalking then
chapter mona murray's journal same dayo'clock p
m
oh but i am tired
if it were not that i had made my diary a duty i should not open it tonight
we had a lovely walk
lucy after awhile was in gay spirits owing i think to some dead cow's who came nosing towards us in a field close to the lighthouse and frightened the sits out of us
i believe we forgot everything except of course personal fear and it seemed to wipe the slate clean and give us a fresh start
we had a capital' severe tea' at robin hood's bay in a sweet little old fashioned in'm with a bow window right over the seaweed covered rocks of the strand
i believe we should have shocked the' new woman' with our appetite c
men are more tolerant bless them
then we walked home with some or rather many stoppage store stand with our hearts full of a constant dread of wild bulls
lucy was really tired and we intended to creep off to bed as soon as we could
the young curate came in. however and its
westenra asked him to stay for supper
lucy and i had both a fight for it with the dusty miller
i know it was a hard fight on my part and i am quite heroic
i think that someday the bishops must get together and see about breeding ups new class of curate's whodon't takes upper no matter how hard they may be pressed to and who will know when girls are tired
lucy is asleep and breathing softly
she has more colour in her cheeks than usual and looks oh so sweet
if mr.
holmwood fell in love with her seeing her only in the drawing room i wonder what he would say if he saw her now
some of the' new women' writers will someday start an idea that men and women should be allowed to see each other asleep before proposing or accepting
but i suppose the' new woman'son't condescend in future to accept
she will do the proposing herself
and a nice job she will make of it too
there's some consolation in that
i am so happy tonight because dear lucy seems better
i really believe she has turned the corner and that we are over her troubles with dreaming
i should be quite happy if i only knew if jonathan
god bless and keep him
august
diary again
no sleep now so i may as well write
i am too agitated to sleep
we have had such an adventure such an agonizing experience
i fell asleep as soon as i had closed my diary
suddenly i became broad awake and sat up with a horrible sense of fear upon means of some feeling of emptiness around me
the room was dark so i could not see lucy's bed
i stole a cross and felt for her
the bed was empty
ilita match and found that she was not in the room
the door was shut but not locked as i had left it
i feared to wake her mother who has been more than usually i'll lately so threw on some clothes and got ready to look for her
as i was leaving the room it struck me that the clothes she wore might give me some clue to her dreaming intention
dressing gown would mean house dress outside
dressing gown and dress were both in their places
thank god i said to myself she can not be far as she is only in her nightdress
i ran downstairs and looked in the sitting room
notthere
then i looked in all the other rooms of the house with an ever growing fear chilling my heart
finally i came to the hall door and found it open
it was not wide open but the catch of the lock had not caught
the people of the house are careful to lock the door every night so i feared that lucy must have gone out as she was
there was no time to think of what might happen
a vague over mastering fear obscured all details
i took a big heavy shawl and ran out
the clock was striking one as i was in the crescent and there was not a soul insight
i ran along the north terrace but could see no sign of the white figure which i expected
at the edge of the west cliff above the pier i looked across the harbour to the east cliff in the hope of fear idin't know which of seeing lucy in our favourite seat
there was a bright full moon with heavy black driving clouds which threw the whole scene into a fleeting diorama of light and shade as they sailed across
for a moment or two i could see nothing as the shadow of a cloud obscured st
mary's church and all around it
then as the cloud passed i could see the ruins of the abbey coming into view and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword cut moved along the church and churchyard became gradually visible
whatever my expectations as it was not disappointed for there on our favourites eat the silver light of the moonstruck a half reclining figure snowy white
the coming of the cloud was too quick for me to see much for shadow shut down on light almost immediately but it seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the white figures home and bent over it
what it was whether manor beast i could not tell
i did not wait to catch another glance but flew down the steep steps to the pier and along by the fish market to the bridge which was the only way to reach the east cliff
the town seemed as dead for not a soul did i see
i rejoiced that it was so for i wanted no witness of poor lucy's condition
the time and distance seemed endless and my knees trembled and my breath came laboured as it oiled up the endless steps to the abbey
i must have gone fast and yet it seemed to me as if my feet were weighted with lead and as though every joint in my body were rusty
when i got almost to the top i could see the seat and the white figure for i was now close enough to distinguish it even through the spells of shadow
there was undoubtedly something long and black bending over the half reclining white figure
i called in fright lucy
lucy
and some thing raised ahead and from where i was i could see a white face and red gleaming eyes
lucy did not answer and i ran into the entrance of the churchyard
as i entered the church was between me and the seat and for a minute or so i lost sight of her
when i came in view again the cloud had passed and the moonlight struck so brilliantly that i could see lucy half reclining with her head lying over the back of the seat
she was quite alone and there was not a sign of any living thing about
when i bent over her i could see that she was still asleep
her lips were parted and she was breathing not softly as usual with her but in long heavy gasps as though striving to get her lungs full at every breath
as i came close she put up her hand in her sleep and pulled the collar other night dress close around her as though she felt the cold
i flung the warm shawl over her and drew the edges tight around her neck for i dreaded lest she should get some deadly chill from the night air in clad as she was
i feared to wake her all at once so in order to have my hands free to help her i fastened the shawl at her throat with a big safety pin
but i must have been clumsy in my anxiety and pinched or pricked her with it for bj and by when her breathing became quieter she put her hand to her throat again and moaned
when i had her carefully wrapped up i put my shoes on her feet and then began very gently to wake her
at first she did not respond but gradually she became more and more uneasy in her sleep moaning and sighing occasionally
at last as time was passing fast and for many other reasons i wished together home at once i shook her forcibly till finally she opened her eyes and awoke
she did not seem surprised to see me as of course she did not realize all at once where she was
lucy always wales prettily and even at such a time when her body must have been chilled with cold and her mind somewhat appalled at waking in clad in a churchyard at night she did not lose her grace
she trembled a little and clung to me
when i told her to come at once with me home she rose without a word with the obedience of a child
as we passed along the gravel hurt my feet and lucy noticed me wince
she dropped and wanted to insist upon my taking my shoes but i would not
however when we got to the pathway outside the church yard where there was a puddle of water remaining from the storm i daubed my feet with mud using each foot in turn on the other so that as we went home no one in case we should meet anyone should notice my bare feet
fortune favoured us and we got home without meeting a soul
once we saw a man who seemed not quite sober passing along a street in front of us
but we hid in a door till he had disappeared up an opening such as there are here steep little closed it's gyda' as they call them in scotland
my heart beat so loud all the time sometimes i thought i should faint
i was filled with anxiety about lucy not only for her health lest she should suffer from the exposure but for her reputation in case the story should get wind
when we got in and had washed our feet and had said a prayer of thankfulness together i tucked her into bed
before falling asleep she asked even implored me not to say a word to anyone even her mother about her sleep walking adventure
i hesitated at first to promise but on thinking of the state of her mother's health and how the knowledge of such a thing would be ether and think top of how such a story might become distorted may infallibly would incase it should leak out i thought it wiser to do so
i hope i did right
i have locked the door and the key is tied to my wrist so perhaps i shall not be again disturbed
lucy is sleeping soundly
the reflex of the dawn is high and far over the sea
same day noon
all goes well
lucy slept till i woke her and seemed not to have even changed her side
the adventure of the night does not seem to have harmed her on the contrary it has benefited here or she looks better this morning than she had done for weeks
i was sorry to notice that my clumsiness with the safety pin hurt her
indeed it might have been serious for the skin of her throat was pierced
i must have pinched up a piece of loose skin and have transfixed it for there are two little red points like pinprick sand on the band other night dress was a drop of blood
when i apologised and was concerned about it she laughed and petted me and said she did not even feel it
fortunately it can not leave as far as it is so tiny
same day night
we passed a happy day
the air was clear and the sun bright and there was a cool breeze
we took our lunch to mulgrave woods mrs.
westenra driving by the road and lucy and i walking by the cliff path and joining her at the gate
i felt a little sad myself for i could not but feel how absolutely happy it would have been had jonathan been with me
but there
i must only be patient
in the evening we strolled in the casino terrace and heard some good music by spohr and mackenzie and went to bed early
lucy seeks more restful than she has been for some time and fell asleep at once
i shall lock the door and secure the key the same as before though i do not expect any trouble tonight
august
my expectations were wrong for twice during the night is a awakened by lucy trying to get out
she seemed even in her sleep to be a little impatient at finding the door shut and went back to bed under a sort of protest
i woke with the dawn and heard the birds chirping outside of the window
lucy sole too and i was glad to see was even better than on the previous morning
all her old gaiety of manner seemed to have come back and she came and snuggled in beside me and told me all about arthur
i told her how anxious i was about jonathan and then she tried to comfort me
well she succeeded somewhat for though sympathy can' halter facts it can make them more bearable
august
another quiet day and to bed with the key on my wrist as before
again i awoke in the night and found lucy sitting up in bed still asleep pointing to the window
i got up quietly and pulling aside the blind looked out
it was brilliant moonlight and the soft effect of the light over the sea and sky merged together in one great silent mystery was beautiful beyond words
between me and the moonlight flitted a great bay coming and going in great whirling circles
once or twice it came quite close but was i suppose frightened at seeing me and flitted a way across the harbour towards the abbey
when i came back from the window lucy had lain down again and was sleeping peacefully
she did not stir again all night
august
on the east cliff reading and writing all day
lucy seems to have become as much in love with the spot asian and it is hard together away from it when it is time to come home for lunch or tea or dinner
this afternoon she made a funny remark
we were coming home for dinner and had come to the top of the steps up from the west pier and stopped to look at the view as we generally do
the setting sun lowdown on the sky was just dropping behind kettle news
the red light was thrown over on the east cliff and the old abbey and seemed to bathe everything in a beautiful rosy glow
we were silent for awhile and suddenly list murmured as it to herself
his red eyes again
they are just the same
it was such an odd expression coming apropos of nothing that it quite startled me
isle wed found a little so as to see lucy well without seeming to stare at her and saw that she was in a half dreamy state with an odd look on her face that i could not quite make out so i said nothing but followed her eyes
she appeared to be looking over at our own seat where one as a dark figure seated alone
i was quite a little startled myself for it seemed for an instant as if the stranger had great eyes like burning flames but a second look dispelled the illusion
the red sunlight was shining on the windows of st
mary's church behind our seat and as the sun dipped there was just sufficient change in the refraction and reflection to make it appear as if the light moved
i called lucy's attention to the peculiar effect and she became herself with a start but she looked sad all the same
it may have been that she was thinking of that terrible night up there
we never refer to it so i said nothing and we went home to dinner
lucy had a headache and went early to bed
i saw her asleep and went out for a little stroll myself
i walked along the cliffs to the westward and was full of sweet sadness for i was thinking of jonathan
when coming home it was then bright moon light so bright that though the front of our part of the crescent was in shadow everything could be well seen i threw a glance up at our window and saw lucy's head leaning out
i opened my handkerchief and waved it
she did not notice or make any movement whatever
just then the moonlight crept found an angle of the building and the light fell on the window
there distinctly was lucy with her head lying up against the side of the windowsill and her eyes shut
she was fast asleep and by her seated on the windowsill was something that looked like a good sized bird
i was afraid she might get a chill so i ran upstairs but as i came into the room she was moving back to her bed fast asleep and breathing heavily
she was holding her hand to her throat as though to protect it from the cold
i did not wake her but tucked her up warmly
i have taken care that the door is locked and the window securely fastened
she looks so sweet as she sleeps but she is paler than usher dogg and there is a drawn haggard look under her eyes which i do not like
i fear she is fretting about something
i wish i could find out what it is
august
rose later than usual
lucy was languid and tired and slept on after we had been called
we had a happy surprise at breakfast
arthur's father is better and wants the marriage to come off soon
lucy is full of quiet joy and her mother is glad and sorry at once
later on in the day she told me the cause
she is grieved to lose lucy as her very own but she is rejoiced that she is soon to have someone to protect her
poor dear sweet lady
she confided to me that she has got her death warrant
she has not told lucy and made me promises card cy
her doctor told her that within a few months at most she must die for her heart is weakening
at anytime even now a sudden shock would be almost sure to kill her
ah we were wise to keep from her the affair of the dreadful night of lucy's sleepwalking
august
no diary for two whole days
i have not had the heart to write
some sort of shadow up all seems to be coming over our happiness
no news from jonathan and lucy seems to be growing weaker whilst her mother's hours are numbering to a close
i do not understand lucy's fading away as she is doing
she eats well and sleeps well and enjoys the fresh air but all the time the roses in her cheeks are fading and she gets weaker and more languid day by day
at night i hear her gasping as if for air
i keep the key of outdoor always fastened to my wrist at night but she gets up and walks about the room and sits at the open window
last night i found her leaning out when i woke up and when i tried to wake her i could not
she was in a faint
when i managed to restore her she was weak as water and cried silently between long painful struggles for breath
when i asked her how she came to beat the windows he shook her head and turned away
i trust her feeling ill may not be from that unlucky prick of the safety pin
i looked at her throat just now as she lay asleep and the tiny wounds seem not to have healed
they are still open and if anything larger than before and the edges of them are faintly white
they are like little white dots with red centres
unless they heap within a day or two i shall insist on the doctor seeing about them

i am happy today and write sitting on the seat in the churchyard
lucy is ever so much better
last night she slept well all night and did not disturb me once
the roses seem coming back already to her cheeks though she is still sadly pale and wank poking
if she were in any way anemic i could understand it but she is not
she is in gay spirits and full of life and cheerfulness
all the morbid reticence seems to have passed from her and she has just reminded me as if i needed any reminding of that night and that it was here on this very seat i found her asleep
as she told me she tapped playfully with the heel of her bolton the stone slab and said my poor little feetdidn't make much noise then
i daresay poor old mr.
swales would have told me that it was because i didn't want to wake up geordie
as she was in such a communicative humour i asked her if she had dreamed at all that night
before she answered that sweet puckered look came into her forehead which arthur i. call him arthur frommer habit says he loves and indeed idon't wonder that he does
then she went on in a half dreaming kind of way as if trying to recall it to herself
i didn't quite dream but it all seemed to be real
i only wanted to be here in this spot
idon't know why for i was afraid of something idon't know what
i remember though i suppose i was asleep passing through the streets and over the bridge
a fish leaped as i went by and i leaned over to look at it and i heard alot of dogs howling
the whole town seemed as if it must be full of dogs all howling at once as i went up the steps
then i had a vague memory of something long and dark with red eyes just as we saw in the sunset and something very sweet and very bitter all around me at once
and then i seemed sinking into deep green water and there was a singing in my ears as i have heard there is to drowning men and then everything seemed passing away from me
my soul seemed to go out from my body and float about the air
i seem to remember that once the west lighthouse was right under me and then there was a sort of agonizing feeling as if i were in an earthquake and i came back and found you shaking my body
i saw you do it before i felt you
then she began to laugh
it seemed a little uncanny tome and i listened to her breathlessly
i did not quite like it and thought it better not to keep her mind on the subject so we drifted into another subject and lucy was like her old self again
when we got home the fresh breeze had braced her up and her pale cheeks were really more rosy
her mother rejoiced when she saw her and we all spent a very happy evening together
august
joy joy joy
although not all joy
at last news of jonathan
the dear fellow has been ill that is why he did not write
i am not afraid to think it or to say it now that i know
mr
hawkins sent me on the letter and wrote himself oh so kindly
i am to leave in the morning and go over to jonathan and to help to nurse him if necessary and to bring him home
mr
hawkins says it would not be a bad thing if we were to be married out there
i have cried over the good sister's letter till i can feel it set against my bosom where it lies
it is of jonathan and must be near my heart for he is inmyheart
my journey is all mapped out and my luggage ready
i am only taking one change if dress
lucy will bring my trunk to london and keep it till i send for it for it may be that
i must write no more
i must keep it to say to jonathan my husband

he has been under our care for nearly six weeks suffering from a violent brain fever
he wishes me to convey his love and to say that by this post i write for him to me
peter hawkins exeter today with his dutiful respects that he is sorry for his delay and that all of his work is completed
he will require some few weeks' rest in our sanatorium in the hills but will then return
he wishes me to say that he has not sufficient money with him and that he would like to pay for his staying here so that others who need shall not be wanting for help
believe me yours with sympathy and all blessings
sister agatha p

my patient being asleep i open this to let you know something more
he has told me all about you and that you are shortly to be his wife
all blessings to you both
he has had some fearful shock so says our doctor and into a delirium no cravings have been dreadful of wolves and poison and blood of ghosts and demons and i fear to say of what
be careful of him always that there may be nothing to excite him of this kind for a long time to come
the traces of such an illness as his do not lightly die away
we should have written long ago but we knew nothing of his friends and there was nothing on him nothing that anyone could understand
he came in the train from klaus en burn and the guard was told by the station master there that he rushed into the station shouting for a ticket for home
seeing from his violent demeanour that he was english they gave him a ticket for the furthest station on the way thither that the train reached
be assured that he is well cared for
he has won all hearts by his sweetness and gentleness
he is truly getting on well and i have no doubt will in a few weeks be all himself
but be careful of him for safety's sake
there are i pray god and st
joseph and she
mary many many happy years for you both
dr
seward's diary august
strange and sudden change in renfield last night
about eighto'clock he began to get excited and sniff about as a dog does when setting
the attendant was struck by his manner and knowing my interest in him encouraged him to talk
he is usually respectful to the attendant and at times servile but tonight the man tells me he was quite haughty
would not condescend to talk with him at all
all he would say was idon't want to talk to you
youdon''t count now
the master is at hand
the attendant thinks it is some sudden form of religious mania which has seized him
if so we must lookout for squalid for a strong man with homicidal and religious mania at once might be dangerous
the combination is a dreadful one
at nineo'clock i visited him myself
his attitude to me was the same as that to the attendant
in his sublime self feeling the difference between myself and the attendant seemed to him as nothing
it looks like religious mania and he will soon think that he himself is god
these infinitesimal distinctions between man and manage too paltry for an omnipotent being
how these madmen give themselves away
the real god taketh heed lest a sparrow fall
but the god created from human vanity sees no difference between an eagle and a sparrow
it if men only knew
for half an hour or more renfield kept getting excited in greater and greater degree
i did not pretend to be watching him but i kept strict observation all the same
all at once that shifty look came into his eyes which we always see when a madman has seized an idea and with it the shifty movement of the head and back which asylum attendants come to know sowell
he became quite quiet and went and sat on the edge of his bed resignedly and looked into space with lackluster eyes
i thought i would find out of his apathy were real or only assumed and tried to lead him to talk of his pet's a theme which had never failed to excite his attention
at first he made no reply but at length said testily bother them all
idon't care spin about them
what
i said
youdon't mean to tell me youdon''t care about spiders
spiders at present age his hobby and the notebook is filling up with columns of small figures
to this he answered enigmatic ally the bride maidens rejoice the eyes that wait the coming of the bride
but when the bride draweth night get the maidens shine not to the eyes that are filled
he would not explain himself but remained obstinately seated on his bed all the time i remained with him
i am weary tonight and low in spirits
i can not but think of lucy and how different things might have been
if idon't sleep at once chloral the modern morpheus
i must be careful not to let it grow into a habit
no i shall take home tonight
i have thought of lucy and i shall not dishonour her by mixing the two
if need be tonight shall be sleepless
later
glad i made the resolution glasser that i kept to it
i had lain tossing about and had heard the clock strike only twice when the night watchman same time went up from the ward to say that renfield had escaped
i threw on my clothes and ran down at once
my patient is too dangerous a person to be roaming about
those ideas of his might work out dangerously with strangers
the attendant was waiting for me
he said he had seen him not ten minutes before seemingly asleep in his bed when he had looked through the observation trap in the door
his attention was called by the sound of the window being drenched out
he ran back and saw his feet disappear through the window and had at once went up for me
he was only in his night gear and can not be far off
the attendant thought it would be more useful to watch where he should go than to follow him as he might lose sight of him whilst getting out of the building by the door
he is a bulky man andcouldn't get through the window
i am thin so with his aid i got out but feet foremost and as we were only a few feet above ground landed unhurt
the attendant told me the patient had gone to the left and had taken a straight line so i ran as quickly as i could
as i got through the belt of trees i saw a white figure scale the high wall which separates our grounds from those of the deserted house
i ran back at once told the watchman to get tired of four men immediately and follow me into the grounds of carfax in case our friend might be dangerous
i got a ladder myself and crossing the wall dropped down on the other side
i could see renfield's figure just disappearing behind the angle of the house so i ran after him
on the far side of the house i found him pressed close against the old iron found oak door of the chapel
he was talking apparently to someone but i was afraid to go near enough to hear what he was saying lest i might frighten him and he should run off
chasing an errant swarm of bees is nothing to following a naked lunatic when the fit of escaping is upon him
after a few minutes however i could see that he did not take note of anything around him and so ventured to draw nearer to him the more so as my men had now crossed the wall and were closing him in
i heard him say
i am here to do your bidding master
i am your slave and you will reward me for i shall be faithful
i have worshipped you long and afar off
now that you are near i await your commands and you will not pass me by will you dear master in your distribution of good things
he is a selfish old beggar anyhow
he thinks of the loaves and fishes even when he believes he is in a real presence
his mania's make a startling combination
when we closed in on him he fought like a tiger
he is immensely strong for he was more like a wild beast than a man
i never saw a lunatic in such a paroxysm of rage before and i hope i shall not again
it is a mercy that we have found out his strength and his danger in good time
with strength and determination like his he might have done wild work before he was caged
he is safe now at any rate
back sheppard himselfcouldn't get free from the strait waistcoat that keeps him restrained and he's chained to the wall in the padded room
his cries are at times awful but the silences that follow are more deadly still for he means murder in every turn and movement
just now he spoke coherent words for the first time
i shall be patient master
it is coming coming coming
so i took the hint and came too
i was too excited to sleep but this diary has quieted me and i feel i shall get some sleep tonight
chapter let term in a marker to lucy westenra budapest h august
my dearest lucy i know you will be anxious to hear all that has happened since we parted at the railway station at whitby
well my dear i got to hull all right and caught the flat to hamburg and then the train on here
i feel that i can hardly recall anything of the journey except that i knew i was coming to jonathan and that as i should have to do some nursing i had better get all the sleep i could
i found my dear one pm within and lake and weak looking
all the resolution has gone out of his dead eyes and that quiet dignity which i told you was in his face has vanished
he is only a wreck of himself and he does not remember anything that has happened to him for a long time past
at least he wants me to believe so and i shall never ask
he has had some terrible shock and i fear it might tax his poor brain if he were to try to recall it
sister agatha who is a good creature and a born nurse tells me that he wanted her to tell me what they were but she would only cross herself and says he would never tell that the ravings of the sick were the secrets of god and that if a nurse through her vocation should hear them she should respect her trust
she is a sweet good soul and the next day when she saw i was troubled she opened up the subject again and after saying that she could never mention what my poor dear raved about added' i can tell you this much my dear that it was not about anything which he has done wrong himself and you as his wife to behave no cause to be concerned
he has not forgotten you or what he owed to you
his fear was of great and terrible things which no mortal can treat of
' i do believe the dead soul thought i might be jealous of st. my poor dear should have fallen in love with any other girl
the idea of my being jealous about jonathan
and get my dear let me whisper i felt a thrill of joy through me when i knew that no other woman was a cause for trouble
i am now sitting by his bedside where i can see his face while he sleeps
he is waking
when he woke he asked me for his coat as he wanted to get something from the pocket
i asked sister agatha and she brought all his things
i saw amongst them was his notebook and was going to ask him to let me look at it for i knew that i might find some clue to his trouble but i suppose he must have seen my wish in my eyes for he sent me over to the window saying he wanted to be quite alone for a moment
then he called me back and he said to me very solemnly' wilhelmina' i knew then that he was in deadly earnest for he has never called me by that name since he asked me to marry him' you know dear my ideas of the trust between husband and wife
there should be no secret no concealment
i have had a great shock and when i try to think of what it is i feel my head spin round and i do not know if it was deal of the dreaming of a madman
you know i had brain fever and that is to be mad
the secret is here and i do not want to know it
i want to take up my life here without marriage
' for my dear we had decided to be married as soon as the formalities are complete
' are you willing wilhelmina to share my ignorance
here is the book
take it and keep it read it if you will but never let me know unless indeed some solemn duty should come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awake same or had recorded here
' he fell back exhausted and i put the book under his pillow and kissed him
i have asked sister agatha to get the superior to let our wedding be this afternoon and am waiting her reply
she has come and told me that the chaplain of the english mission church has been sent for
we are to be married in an hour or as soon after as jonathan awakes
list the time has come and home
i feel very solemn but very very happy
jonathan woke a little after the hour and all was ready and he sat up in bed propped up with pillows
he answered his' i will' firmly and strong
i could hardly speak
my heart was so full that even those words seemed to choke me
the dead sisters were so kind
please god i shall never never forget them nor the brave and sweet re soon sibilities i have taken upon me
i must tell you of my wedding present
when the chaplain and the sisters had left me alone with my husband on lucy it is the first time i have written the words' my husband' left me alone with my husband i took the book from under his pillow and wrapped it up in white paper and tied it with a little bit of pale blue ribbon which was found my neck and sealed it over the knot with sealing wax and for my seal i used my wedding ring
then i kissed it and showed it to my husband and told him that i would keep it so and then it would be an outward and visible sign for us all our lives that we trusted each other that i would never open it unless it were for his own dear sale or for the sake of some stern duty
then he took my hand in his anson lucy it was the first time he took his wife's hand and said that it was the dearest thing in all the wide world and that he would go through all the past again to do not if need be
the poor dear meant to have said a part of the past but he can not think of time yet and i shall not wonder if at first he mixes up not only the month but the year
well my dear what could i say
i could only tell him that i was the happiest woman in all the wide world and that i had nothing to give him except myself my life and my trust and that with these went my love and duty for all the days of my life
and my dear when he kissed me and drew me to him with his poor weak hands it was like a solemn pledge between us
lucy dear do you know why i tell you all this
it is not only because it is all sweet home but because you have been and are very dear home
it was my privilege to be your friend and guide when you came from the schoolroom to prepare for the world of life
i want you to see now and with the eyes of a very happy wife whither duty has led me so that in your own married life you too may be all happy as i am
my dear please almighty god your life may be all it promises a long day of sunshine with no harsh wind no forgetting duty no distrust
i must not wish you no pain for that can never be but i do hope you will be always as happy as i am now
goodbye my dear
i shall post this at once and perhaps write you very soon again
i must stop for jonathan is waking
i must attend my husband
your ever loving him a marker
letter lucy west end atom in a marker
whitby august
my dearest mina oceans of love and millions of kisses and may you soon be in your own home with your husband
i wish you were coming home soon enough to stay with us here
the strong air would soon restore jonathan
it has quite restored me
i have an appetite like a cormorant am full of life and sleep well
you will be glad to know that i have quite given up walking in my sleep
i think i have not stirred out of my bed for a week that is when i once got into it at night
arthur says i am getting fat
by the way i forgot to tell you that arthur is here
we have such walks and drives and rides and rowing and tennis and fishing together and i love him more than ever
he tells me that he loves me more but i doubt that for at first he told me that hecouldn't love me more than he did then
but this is nonsense
there he is calling home
so no more just at present from your loving lucy

seward's diary august
the case of renfield grows even more interesting
he has now so far quieted that there are spells of cessation from his passion
for the first week after his attack he was perpetually violent
then one night just as the moon rose he grew quiet and kept murmuring to himself
now i can wait
now i can wait
the attendant came to tell me so i ran down at once to have a look at him
he was still in the strait waistcoat and in the padded room but the suffused look had gone from his face and his eyes had something of their old pleading
i might almost say cringing softness
i was satisfied with his present condition and directed him to be relieved
the attendants hesitated but finally car ried out my wishes without protest
it was a strange thing that the patient had humour enough to see their distrust for coming close to me he said in a whisper all the while looking furtively at them they think i could hurt you
fans the hurting you
the tools
it was soothing somehow to the feelings to find myself disassociated even in the kind of this poor madman from the others but all the same i do not follow his thought
ami to make it that i have anything in common with him so that we are as it were to stand together
of haste to gain from me some good so stupendous that my wellbeing is needful to him
i must find out later on
tonight he will not speak
even the offer of a kitten or even a full grown cat will not tempt him
he will only say idon't take any stock in cats
i have more to think it now and i can wait
i can wait
after awhile i left him
the attendant tells me that he was quiet until just before dawn and that then he began to get uneasy and at length violent until at last he fell into a paroxysm which exhausted him so that he swooned into a sort of coma
three nights has the same thing happened violent all day then quiet from moon rise to sunrise
i wish i could get some clue to the cause
it would almost seem as if there was some influence which came and went
happy thought
we shall tonight plays a new its against marines
he escaped before without our help
tonight he shall escape with it
we shall give him a chance and have the men ready to follow in case they are required
august
the expected always happens
how well disraeli knew life
our bird when he found the cage open would not fly so all our subtle arrangements were for nought
at any rate we have proved one thing that the spells of quietness last a reasonable time
we shall in future be able to ease his bones for a few hours each day
i have given orders to the night attendant merely to shut him in the padded room when once he is quiet until the hour before sunrise
the poor soul's body will enjoy the relief even if his mind can not appreciate it
mark
the unexpected again
i am called
the patient has once more escaped
later
another night adventure
renfield artfully waite sun jul the attendant was entering the room to inspect
then he dashed out past him and flew down the passage
i sent word for the attendants to follow
again he went into the grounds of the deserted house and we found him in the same place pressed against the old chapel door
when he saw me he became curious and had not the attendants seized him in time he would have tried to kill me
as we were holding him a strange thing happened
he suddenly redoubled his efforts and then as suddenly grew calm
i looked round instinctively but could see nothing
then i caught the patient's eye and followed it but could trace nothing as it looked into the moonlight sky except a big fat which was flapping its silent and ghostly way to the west
bats usually wheel about but this one seemed to go straight on as if it knew where it was bound for or had some intention of its own
the patient grew calmer every instant and presently said you need n' thieme
i shall go quietly
without trouble we came back to the house
i feel there is something ominous in his calm and shall not forget this night
lucy westenra's diary gillingham august
i must imitate mina and keep writing things down
then we can have long talks when we do meet
i wonder when it will be
i wish she were with me again for i feel so unhappy
last night i seemed to be dreaming again just as i was at whitby
perhaps it is the change of air org string home again
it is all dark and horrid time for i can remember nothing
but i am full of vague fear and i feel so weak and without
when arthur came to lunch he looked quite grieved when he saw me and ihavn't the spirit to try to be cheerful
i wonder if i could sleep in mother's room tonight
i shall make an excuse to try
august
another bad night
mother did not seem to take to my proposal
she seems not too well herself and doubtless she fears to worry me
i tried to keep awake and succeeded for awhile but when the clock struck twelve it wakes me from a dose so i must have been falling asleep
there was a sort of scratching or flapping at the window but i did not mind if and as i remember no more i suppose i must have fallen asleep
more bad dreams
i wish i could remember them
this morning i am horribly weak
my face is ghastly pale and my throat pains me
it must be something wrong with my lungs for idon't seem to be getting air enough
i shall try to cheer up when arthur comes or else i know he will be miserable to see me so
letter arthur todd
seward albemarle hotel august my dear jack i want you to come a favour
lucy isilo that is she has no special disease but she looks awful and is getting worse every day
i have asked her if there is any cause i not dare to ask her mother cor to disturb the poor lady's mind about her daughter in her present state of health would be fatal
mrs
westenra had confided to me that her do omission db disease of the heart though poor lucy does not know it yet
i am sure that there is something preying on my dear girl's mind
i am almost distracted when i think other
to look at her gives me a pang
i told her i should ask you to see her and though she demurred at first i know why old fellow she finally consented
it will be a painful task for you i know old friend but it is for her sake and i must not hesitate to ask if you to act
you are to come to lunch at gillingham tomorrow twoo'clock so as not to arouse any suspicion in mrs.
westenra and after lunch lucy will take an opportunity of being alone with you
i am filled with anxiety and want to consult with you alone as soon as i can after you have seen her
do not fail
arthur
telegram arthur holmwood to seward september an summoned to see my father who is worse
am writing
write me fully by tonight's post to ring
wire me if necessary
letter from dr
seward to arthur holmwood september my dear old fellow with regard to miss westenra's health i hasten to let you know at once that in my opinion there is not any functional disturbance or any malady that i know of
at the same time i am not by any means satisfied with her appearance
she is woefully different from what she was when i saw her last
of course you must bear in mind that i did not have full opportunity of examination such as i should wish
our very friendship makes a little difficulty which not even medical science or custom can bridge over
i had better tell you exactly what happened leaving you to draw in a measure your own conclusions
i shall then say what i have done and propose doing
i found miss westenra in seemingly gay spirits
her mother was present and in a few seconds i made up my mine that she was trying all she knew to mislead her mother and prevent her from being anxious
i have no doubt she guessed if she does not know what need of caution there is
we lunches alone and as we all exerted ourselves to be cheerful we got as some kind of reward for our labour's some real cheerfulness amongst us
then mrs.
westenra went to lie down and lucy was left with me
we went into her boudoir and full we got there yet gaiety remained for the servants were coming and going
as soon as the door was closed however the mask fell from her face and she sank down into a chair with a great sigh and hid her eyes with her hand
when i saw that her high spirits had failed i at once took advantage of her reaction to make a diagnosis
she said to me very sweetly' i can not tell you how i loathe talking about myself
' i reminded her that a doctor's confidence was sacred but that you were grievously anxious about her
she caught onto my meaning we once and settled that matter in a word
' tell arthur everything you choose
i do not care for myself but for him
' so i am quite free
i could easily see that she was somewhat blood lead but i could not see the usual anemic signs and by the chance i was able to test the actual quality of her blood for in opening a window which was stier asked gave way and she cut her hands lightly with broken glass
it was a slight matter in itself but it gave me an evident chance and i secured a few drops of the blood and have analysed them
the qualitative analysis give a quite normal condition and shows i should infer in itself a vigorous state of health
in other physical matters i was quite satisfied that there is no need for anxiety but as there must be a cause somewhere i have come to the conclusion that it must be some thing mental
she complains of difficulty breathing satisfactorily at times and of heavy lethargic sleep with dreams that frighten her but regarding which she can remember nothing
she says that as a child she used to walk in her sleep and that when in whitby the habit came back and that once she walked out in the night and went to east cliff where miss murray found her
but she assured me that of late the habit has not returned
i am in doubt and so have done the best thing i know if
i have written to my old friend and master professor van helsing of amsterdam who knows as much about obscure diseases as anyone in the world
i have asked him to come over and as you told me that all things were to hear your charge i have mentioned to him who you are and your relations to miss westenra
this my dear fellow is in obedience to your wishes for i am only too proud and happy to do anything i can forget
van helsing would i know do anything for me for a personal reasons i no matter on what ground becomes we must accept his wishes
he is a seemingly arbitrary man this is because he knows what he is talking about better than anyone else
he is a philosopher and a metaphysician and one of the most advanced scientists of his day and he had i believe an absolutely open mind
this with an iron nerve a temper of the ice brook and indomitable resolution self command and toleration exalted from virtues to blessings and the kind liest and truest heart that beats these form his equipment for the noble work that he is doing for mankind work both in theory and practice for his views areas wide x show all embracing sympathy
i tell you these facts that you may know why i have such confidence in him
i have asked him to come at once
i shall see miss westenra tomorrow again
she is to meet me at the stores so that i may not alarm her mother by too early a repetition of my fall
yours always

my good friend when i received your letter i am already coming to you

we're fortune other then it were bad for those who have trusted for i come to my friend when he call me to aid those he holds dear

but it is pleasure added to do for him your friend it is to you that i come
have near at hand and please its o arrange that we may see the young lady not too late on tomorrow for it is likely that i may have to return here that night

letter dr
seward to hon
arthur holmwood september my dear art van helsing has come and none
he came on with me to gillingham and found that by lucy's discretion her mother was punching out so that we were alone with her
van helsing made a very careful examination of the patient
he is to report to me and i shall advise you for of course i was not present all the time
he is of war much concerned but says he must think
when i told him of our friendship and how you trust home in the matter he said' you must tell him all you think
tell him what i think if you can guess it if you will
may i am not meeting
this is honest but life and death perhaps more
' i asked what he meant by that god he was very serious
this was when we had come back to town and he was having a cup of tea before starting on his return to amsterdam
he would not give me any further clue
you must not be angry with heart because his very reticence means that all his brains are working for her good
he will speak plainly enough when the time comes be sure
so i told him i would simply write an account of our visit just as if i were doing a descriptive special article for the daily telegraph
he seemed not to notice buy remarked that the smuts of london were not quite so bad as they used to be when he was a student here
i am to get his report tomorrow if he can possibly make it
in any case i am to have a letter
well as to the visit lucy was more cheerful than on the day i first saw her and certainly looked better
she had lost something of the ghastly look that so upset you and her breathing was normal
she was very sweet to the professor as she always us and tried to make him feel at ease though i could see the poor girl was making a hard struggle for it
i believe van helsing saw it too for i saw the quick look under his bus hybrids that i knew of old
then he began to chat of all things except ourselves and diseases and with such an infinite genial ith that i could see poor lucy's pretense of animation merge into reality
then without any seeking change he brought the conversation gently round to his visit and shave it said' my dear young miss i have the so great pleasure because you are so much beloved
that is much my dear even were there that which i do not see
they told me you were down in the spirit and that you were of a ghastly pale
to them is at pour
' and he snapped his fingers at me and went on
' but you and i shall show them how wrong they are
how can be' and he pointed at me with the same look and gesture as that with which he pointed me out in his class on or rather after a particular occasion which he never fails to remind me of' know anything of a young ladies
he has his madmen to play with and to bring them back to happiness and to those that love them
it is much to do and oh but there are rewards in that we can bestow such happiness
but the young ladies
he has now item or daughter and the young do not tell themselves to the young but to the old like me who have known so many sorrows and the causes of them
so my dear we will send him away to smoke the cigarette in the garden whiles you and i have little talk all to ourselves
' i took the hunt and strolled about and presently the professor came to the window and called me in
he looked brave but said' i have made careful examination but there is no functional cause
with you i agree that there has been much blood lost it has been but is not
but the conditions of her are in no way anemic
i have asked her to send me her maid that i may ask just one or two questions that so i may not chance to miss nothing
i know well what she will say
and yet there is cause
there is always cause for everything
i must go back home and think
you must send me the telegram every day and if there because i shall come again
the disease forgot to be well is a disease interest means the sweet young dear she interest me too
she charm means for her if not for you or disease is one
' as i tell you he would not say a word more even when we were alone
and so now art you know all i know
i shall keep stern watch
i trust your poor father is rallying
it must be a terrible thing to you my dear old fellow to be placed in such a position between two people who are both so dear to you
i know your idea of duty to your father and you are right to stick to it
but if need be i shall send you word to come at once to lucy so do not be over anxious unless you hear from me

seward's diary september
zoo pharoh's patient still keeps up our interest in him
he had only one outburst and that was yesterday at an unusual time
just before the stroke of noon he began to grow restless
the attendant knew the symptoms and at once summoned aid
fortunately the men came at a run and were just in time for at the stroke of noon he became so violent that it took all their strength to hold him
i'm about five minutes however he began to get more quiet and finally sank into a sort of melancholy in which state he has remained up to now
the attendant tells me that his screams whilst in the paroxysm were really appalling
i found my hands full when i got in attending to some of the other patients who were frightened by him
indeed i can quite understand the effect for the sounds disturbed even me though i was some distance away
it is now after the dinner hour of the asylum and as yet my patients ltd in a corner brooding with a full sullen woe be gone look in his face which seems rather to indicate than to show something directly
i can not quite understand it
later
another change in my patient
at fiveo'clock i looked in on him and found him seemingly as happy and contented as he used to be
he was catching flies and eating them and was keeping note of his capture by making mail marks on the edge of the door between the ridges of padding
when he saw me became over and apologized for his bad conduct and asked me in a very humble cringing way to be led back to his own room and to have his notebook again
i thought it fell to humour him so he is back in his room with the window open
he has the sugar of his tea spread out on the windowsill and is reaping quotes harvest of flies
he is not now eating them but putting them into a box as of old and is already exam in ing the corners of his room to find a spider
i tried to get him to talk about the past few days for any clue to his thoughts would be of immense help to me but he would not rise
for a moment or two he looked very sad and said in a sort of far away voice as though saying it rather to himself than to me
all over
all over
he has deserted me
no hope for me now unless i do it myself
then suddenly turning to me in a resolute way he said doctordon't you be very good time and let me have a little more sugar
i think it would be very good for me
and the flies
i said
yes
the flies like it too and i like the flies therefore i like it
and there are people who know so little as to think that madmen do not argue
i procured him a double supply and left him as happy a man as i suppose any in the world
i wish i could fathom his mind
midnight
another change in him
i had been to see miss westenra whom i found much better and had just returned and was standing at our own gate looking at the sunset when once more i heard him telling
as his room is on this side of the house i could hear it better than in the morning
it was a shock to me to turn from the wonderful smoky beauty of a sunset over london with its lurid lights and only shadows and all the marvellous hints that come on foul clouds even as on foul water and to realize all the grim sternness of my own cold stone building with its wealth of breathing misery and my own desolate heart to ensure it all
i reached him just as the sun was going down and from his window saw the red disc sink
as it sank he became less and less frenzied and just as it dipped he slid from the hands that held him an inert mass on the floor
it is wonderful however what intellectual recuperative power lunatics have for within a few minutes he stood up quite calmly and looked around him
i signalled to the attendants not to hold him for i was anxious to see what he would do
he went straight over to the window and brushed put the crumbs of sugar
then he took his fly box and emptied it outside and threw away the box
then he shut the window and crossing over sat down on his bed
all this surprised me so i asked him are you going to keep flies any more
no. said he
i am sick of all that rubbish
he certainly is a wonderfully interesting study
i wish i could get some glimpse of his mind or of the cause of his sudden passion
shop
there may be a clue after all if we can find why today his paroxysms came on at high noon and at sunset
can it be that there is a malign influence of the sugar periods which affects certain nature was at times the moon does others
we shall see

seward tobin
arthur holmwood september my dear art my news today is not so good
lucy this morning had gone back a bit
there is however one good thing which has arisen from it
mts
westenra was naturally anxious concerning lucy and has consulted me professionally about her
i took advantage of the opportunity and told her that my old master van helsing the great specialist was coming to stay with me and that i would put her in his charges on jointly with myself
so now we can come and go without alarming her unduly for a shock to her would mean sudden death and this in lucy's weak condition might be disastrous to her
we are merged in with difficulties all of us my poor fellow but please god we shall come through them all right
if any need i shall write so that if you do not hear from me take it for granted that i am simply waiting for news in haste hours every inns ecardd e
seward's diary september
the first thing van helsing said to me when we met at liverpool street was have you said anything to our young friend to lover other
no i said
i waited till i had seen you as i said in my telegram
i wrote him a letter simply telling him that you were coming as miss westenra was not so well and that i should let him know if need be
right my friend he said
quite right
better he not know as yet
perhaps he will never know
i pray so but if it be needed then he shall know all
and my good friend john let me caution you
you deal with the madmen
all men are karin some way of the other and inasmuch as you deal discreetly with your madmen so deal with god's madmen too the rest of the world
you tell not your madmen what you do not why you do it
you tell them not what you think
so you shall keep knowledge in its place where it may rest where it may gather its kind around it and breed
you and i shall keep as yet what we know here and here
he touched me on the heart and on the forehead and then touched himself the same way
i have for myself thoughts at the present
later i shall unfold to you
why not now
i asked
it may do some good
we may arrive at some decision
he looked at me and said my friend john when the corn is grown even before it has ripened while the milk of its mother earth is in him and the sunshine has not yet begun to paint him with his hold the husbandman he pull the ear and run him between his rough hands and blow away the green chaff and say to you'll ok
he's good corn he will make a good crop when the time comes
' i did not see the application and told him so
for reply be reached over and took my ear in his hand and pulled it playfully as he used long ago to do at lectures and said the good husbandman tell you so then because he knows but not till then
but you do not find the good husbandman dig up his planted corn to see if he grow
that is for the children who play at husbandry and not for those who take it as of the work of their life
see you now friend john
i have sown my corn and nature has her work to do in making it sprout if he sprout at all there's some promise and i wait till the war begins to swell
he broke off for he evidently saw that i understood
then he went on gravely you were always a careful student and your casebook was ever more full than the rest
and i trust that good habit have not fail
remember my friend that knowledge is stronger than memory and we should not trust the weaker
even if you have not kept the good practice let me tell you that this case of our dear miss is one that may be mind i say may be of such interest to us and others that all the rest may not make him kick the beam as your people say
take them good note of it
nothing is too small
i counsel you put down in record even your doubts and surmises
hereafter it may be of interest to you to see how true you guess
we learn from failure not from success
when i described lucy's symptoms the same as before but infinitely more marked he looked very grave but said nothing
he took with him a bag in which were many instruments and drugs the ghastly paraphernalia of our beneficial trade as he once called in one of his lectures the equipment of a professor of the healing draft
when we were shown in mrs.
westenra met us
she was alarmed but not nearly so much as i expected to find her
nature in one of her generic lent moods has ordained that even death has some antidote to its own terrors
here in a case where any shock may prove fatal matters are so ordered that from some cause or other the things not personal even the terrible change in her daughter to whom she is so attached do not seem to reach her
it is something like the day game nature gather around a foreign body an envelope of some insensitive tissue which can protect from evil that which it would otherwise harm by contact
if this been ordered selfishness then we should pause before we condemn any one for the vice of egoism for there may be deeper root for its causes than we have knowledge of
i used my knowledge of this phase of spiritual pathology and set diana rule that she should not represent with lucy or think of her illness more than was absolutely required
she assented readily so readily that i saw again the hand of nature fighting for life
van helsing and i were shown up to lucy's room
if i was shocked when i saw her yesterday i was horrified when i saw her today
she was ghastly chalk up goals
the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums and the bone so there are stood out prominently
her breathing was painful to see or hear
van helsing's face grew sets a marble and his eyebrows converged till they almost touched over his nose
lucy lay hot jobless and did not seem to have strength to speak so for a while we were all silent
then van helsing beckoned to me and we went gently out of the room
the instant we had closed the door he stepped quickly along the passage to the next door which was open
then he pulled me quickly in with him and closed the door
my god
he said
this is dreadful
there is not time to be lost
she will die for sheer want of blood to keep the heart's action as it should be
there must be a transfusion of blood at once
is if you orme
i am younger and stronger professor
it must be me
then get ready at once
i will bring up my bag
i am prepared
i went downstairs with him and as we were going there was a knock at the hall door
when we reached them all the maid had just opened the door and arthur was stepping quickly in
he rushed up to me saying in a meager whisper jack i was so anxious
i read between the lines of your letter and have been in an aging
the dad was better so i ran down here to see for myself
is not that gentleman dr
van helsing
i am so thankful to you sir for coming
when first the professor's eye had put upon him he had been angry at his interruption at such a time but now as he took in his et al sadr proportions and recognized the strong young manhood which seemed to emanate from him his eyes gleamed
without a pause he said to him as he held out his hands if you have come in time
you are the lover of our dear miss
she is bad very very bad
nay my child do not go like that
for he suddenly grew pale and sat down in a chair almost fainting
you are to help her
you can do more than any that live and your courage is your best help
what can i do
asked arthur hoarsely
tell me and i shall do it
my life is here and i would give the last drop of blood in my body for her
the professor has a strongly humorous side and i could from old knowledge detect a trace of its origin in his answer
my young sir i do not ask so much as that not the last
what shall i do
there was wire on his eyes and his open nostrils quivered with intent
van helsing slapped him on the shoulder
come
he said
you are a man and it is a man we want
you are better than me better than my friend john
arthur looked bewildered and the professor went on by explaining in a kindly way
young moss is bad very bad
she wants blood and blood she must have or die
my friend john and i have consulted and we are about to perform what we call transfusion of blood to transfer from full veins of one to the empty veins which line for him
john was to give his blood as he is the more young and strong than me
here arthur took my hand and wrung it hard in silence
but now you are here you are more good thank sold or young who took much in the world of thought
our nerves are not so calm and our blood so bright than yours
arthur turned to him and said if you only knew how gladly i would die for her you would understand
he stopped with a sort of choke in his voice
good boy
said van helsing
in the not so far off you will be happy that you have done all former you love
come now and be silent
you shall kiss her once before it is done but then you must go and you must leave at my sign
say no word to madame
you know how it is with her
there must be no shock any knowledge of this would be one
come
we all went up to lucy's room
arthur by direction remained outside
lucy turned her head and looked at us but said nothing
she was not asleep but she was simply too weak to make the effort
her eyes spoke to us that was all
van helsing took some things from his bag and laid them on a little table out of sight
then he mixed a narcotic and coming over to the bed said cheerily how little miss here is your medicine
drink it off like a good child
see i lift you so that to swallow is easy
yes
she had made the effort with success
it astonished me how long the drug took to act
this in fact marked the extent of her weakness
the time seemed endless until sleep began to flicker in her eyelids
at last however the narcotic began to manifest its potency and she fell into a deep sleep
when the professor was satisfied he called arthur into the room and bade him strip off his coat
then he added you may take that one little kids while subring over the table
friend john help home
so neither of us looked whilst he bent over her
van helsing turning to me said he is so young and strong and of blood so pure that we need not define i hate it
then with swiftness but with absolute method van helsing performed the operation
as the trans fusion went on something like life seemed to come back to poor lucy's cheeks and through arthur's growing pallor the joy of his face seemed absolutely to shine
after a bit i began to grow anxious for the loss of blood was telling on arthur strong man as he was
it gave me an idea of what a terrible strain lucy's system must have undergone that what weakened arthur only partially restored her
but the professor's face was set and he stood watching and and with his eyes fixed now on the patient and now on arthur
i could hear my own heart beat
presently he said in a soft voice do not stir an instant
it is enough
you attend him
i will look to her
when all was over i could see how much arthur was weakened
i dressed the sound and took his arm to bring him away when van helsing spoke without turning round the man seems to have eyes in the back of his head the brave lover i think deserve another kiss which he shall have presently
and as he had now finished his operation be adjusted the pillow to the patient's head
as he did so the narrow black velvet band which she seems always to wear round her throat fuck off with a gold diamond buckle which her lover had given her was dragged a little up and showed a red mark on her throat
arthur did not notice it but i could hear the deep hiss of in drawn breath which is one of van helsing's ways of betraying emotion
he said nothing at the moment but turned to me saying now take down our brave young lover give him of the port wine and let him lie down a while
he must then go home and rest sleep much and eat much that he may be recruited of what he has so given to his love
he must not stay here
hold a moment
i may take it did that you are anxious of result
then bring it with you that in allways the operation is successful
you have saved her life this time and you can go home and resteasy in mind that all that can be is
i shall tell her all when she is well
she shall love you nonetheless for what you have done
goodbye
when arthur had gone i went back to the room
lucy was sleeping gently but her breathing was stronger
i could see the counterpane move as her breast heaved
by the bedside sat van helsing looking at her intently
the velvet band again covered the red mark
i asked the professor in a whisper what do you make of that mark on her throat
what do you make of it
i have not examined it yet i answered and then and there proceeded to loose the band
just over the external jugular vein there were two punctures not large but not wholesome looking
there was no sign of disease but the edges were white and worn looking as if by some truth ration
it at once occurred to me that that this wound or whatever it was might be the means of that manifest loss of blood
but i abandoned the idea as soon as it formed for such a thing could not be
the whole bed would have been drenched to a scarlet with the flood which the girl must have lost to leave such a pallor as she had before the transfusion
well
said van helsing
well said i
i can make nothing of it
the professor stood up
i must go back to amsterdam tonight he said there are books and things there which i want
you must remain here all night and you must not let your sight pass from her
shall i have a nurse
i asked
we are the best nurses you and i
you keep watch all night
see that she is well fed and that nothing disturbs her
you must not sleep all the night
later on we can sleep you and i
i shall be back as soon as possible
and then we may begin
may begin
i said
what on earth do you mean
we shall see
he answered as he hurried out
he came back a moment later and put his head inside the door and said with a warning finder held up remember she is your charge
if you leave her and harm befall you shall not sleep easy hereafter
dr
seward's diary continued september
i sat up all night with lucy
the opiate worked itself off towards dusk and she asked naturally
she looked a different being from what she had been before the operation
her spirit seven were good and she was full of a happy vivacity but i could see evidences of the absolute prostration which she had undergone
when i told mrs.
westenra that dr
van helsing had directed that i should sit up with her strap most pooh poohed the idea pointing out her daughter's renewed strength and excellent spirits
i was firm however and made preparations for my long vigil
when her maid had prepared her for the night i came in having in the meantime had supper and took a seat by the bedside
she did not in anyway make objection but looked at me gratefully whenever i caught her eye
after a long spells he seemed sinking off to sleep but with an effort seemed to pull herself together and shook it off
it was apparent that she did not want to sleep so i tackled the subject at once
you do not want to sleep
no
i am afraid
afraid to go to sleep
why so
it is the blonde all crave for
am not if you were like me if sleep was to you a presage of horror
a presage of horror
what on earth do you mean
idon't know
oh idon't know
and that is what is so terrible
all this weakness comes to me in sleep until i'd read the very thought
but my dear girl you may sleep tonight
i am here watching you and i can promise that nothing will happen
who can trust you
she said
i seized the opportunity and said i promise that if i see any evidence of bad dreams i will wake you at once
you will
oh will you really
how good you are home
then i will sleep
and almost at the words he gave a deep sigh of relief and sank back asleep
all night long i watched by her
she never stirred but slept on and on in a deep tranquil life giving health giving sleep
her lips were slightly parted and her breast rose and fell with the regularity of a pendulum
there was a smile interface and it was evident that no bad dreams had come to disturb her peace of mind
in the early morning her maid came and i left her in her care and took myself back home born was anxious about many things
i sent a short sure to van helsing and to arthur telling them of the excellent result of the operation
my own work with its manifold arrears took me all day to clear off
it was dark when i was able to inquire about my zoo pharoh's patient
the report was good
he had been quite quiet for the last day and night
a telegram came from van helsing at amsterdam whilst i was at dinner suggesting that i should be at gillingham tonight as it might be well to be at hand and stating that he was leaving by the night mail and would join me early in the morning
september
i was pretty tired and worn out when i got to gillingham
for two nights i had hardly had a wink of sleep and my brain was beginning to feel that numbness which marks cerebral exhaustion
lucy was up and in cheerful spirits
when she shook hands with me she looked sharply in my face and said no sitting up tonight for you
you are worn out
i am quite well again
indeed i am and if there is to be any sitting up it is i who will sit up with you
i would not argue the point but went and had my supper
lucy came with me and enlivened by her charming presence i made an excellent meal and had a couple of glasses of the more than excellent port
then luck took me upstairs and showed me a room next her own where a cozy fire was burning
now she said
you must stay here
i shall leave this door open and my door top
you can lie on the sofa for i know that nothing could induce any of you doctors to go to bed whilst there is a patient above the horizon
if i want anything i shall fall out and you can come to me at once
i could not but acquiesce for i was dog tired and could not have sarup had i tried
so on her renewing her promise to call me if she should want anything play on the sofa and forgot all about everything
lucy westenra's diary september
i feel so happy tonight
i have been so miserably weak that to be able to think and move about us like feeling sunshine after a long spell of east wind out of a steel sky
somehow arthur feels very very close to me
i seem to feel his presence warn about me
i suppose it is that sickness and weakness are selfish things and turn out in her eyes and sympathy on ourselves whilst health and strength give lovers in and in thought and feeling he can wander where he wills
i know where my thoughts are
if only arthur knew
my dear my dear your ears must tingle as you sleep as mine does king
on the blissful rest of last night
how i slept with that dear good de
seward watching me
and tonight i shall not fear to sleep since he is close at hand and with inc. all
thank everybody for being so good time
thank god
goodnight arthur
dr
seward's diary september
i was conscious of the professor's hand on my head and started awake all in a second
that is one of the things that we learn in an asylum at any rate
and how is outpatient
well when i left her or rather when she left me i answered
come let us see he said
and together we went into the room
the blind was down and i went over to raise it gently whilst van helsing stepped with his soft carluke tread over to the bed
as i raised the blind and the morning sunlight flooded the room i heard the professor's low hiss of inspiration and knowing its rarity a deadly fear shot through my heart
as i passed over he moved back and his exclamation of horror gott in hummel
needed no enforcement from his agonized face
he raised his hand and pointed to the bed and his iron face was drawn and as ben white
i felt my knees begin to tremble
there on the new seemingly in as soon lay poor lucy more horribly white and wan looking than ever
even the lips were white and the gums seemed to have shrunken back from the teeth as we sometimes see in a corpse after a prolonged illness
van helsing raised his foot to stamp in anger but the instinct of his life and all the long years of habits told to him and he put it down again softly
quick
he said
bring the brandy
i flew to the dining room and returned with the decanter
he wetted the poor white lips with it and together we rubbed pain and wrist and heart
he felt her heart and after a few moments of agonizing suspense said it is not too late
it beats though but feebly
all our work is undone
we must begin again
there is no young arthur here now
i have to call on you yourself this time friend john
as he spoke he was dipping into his bag and producing the instruments of transfusion
i had taken off my coat and rolled up my short sleeve
there was no possibility of an opiate just at present and no need of one and so without a moment's delay we began the operation
after a time it did not seem a short time either for the draining away of one's blood no matter how willingly it be given is a terrible feeling van helsing held up a warning finger
do not stir he said
but i fear that with growing strength she may wake and that would make danger oh so much danger
but i shall precaution take
i shall give hypodermic injection of morphix
he proceeded then swiftly and deftly to carry out his intent
the effect on lucy was not bad for the faint seemed to me the duct it into the narcotic sleep
it was with a feeling of personal pride that i could see a faint tinge of colours real back into the pallid cheeks and pips
no man knows till he experiences of what it is to feel his own life blood drawn away into the veins of the woman he loves
the professor watched me critically
that will do he said
already
i demonstrated
you took a great deal more from art
to which he smiled a sad sort of smile as he replied he is her lover her fiance
you have work much work to do for her and for others and the present will suffice
when we stopped the operation he attended to lucy whilst i applied digital pressure to my own incision
i laid down while i waited his leisure to attend to me for i felt faint and a little sick
by and byte bound up my wound and sent me down stairs to get a glass of wine for myself
as i was leaving the room he came after me and half whispered
mind nothing must be said of this
if our young lover should turn up unexpected as before no word to him
it would at once frighten him and en jealousy in top
there must be none
so
when i came back he looked at me carefully and then said you are not much the worse
go into the room and lie on your sofa and rest awhile then have much breakfast and come here to me
i followed out his orders for i knew how right and wise they were
i had done by part and now my next duty was to keep up my strength
i felt very weak and in the weakness lost something of the amazement at what had occurred
i fell asleep on the sofa however wondering over and over again how lucy had made such a retrograde movement and how she could have been drained of so much blood with no sign anywhere to show for it
i think i must have continued my wonder in my dreams for sleeping and waking my thoughts always came back to the little punctures in her throat and the ragged exhausted appearance of their edges tiny though they were
lucy slept well into the day and when she woke she was fairly well and strong though not nearly so much so as the day before
when van helsing had seen her he went out for a walk leaving me in charge with strict injunctions that i was not to leave her for a moment
i could hear his voice in the hall asking the way to the nearest telegraph office
lucy chatted with me freely and seemed quite unconscious that anything had happened
i tried to keep her amused and interested
when her mother came up to see her she did not seem to notice any change whatever buy said to me gratefully we owe you so much dr
seward for all you have done but you really must now take care not to overwork yourself
you are looking pale yourself
you want a wife to nurse and look after you a bit that you do
as she spoke lucy turned crimson though it was only momentarily for her poor wasted veins could not stand for long an unwonted drain to the head
the reaction fame in excessive pallor as she turned imploring eyes on me
i smiled and nodded and laid my finger on my lips
with a sigh she sank back amid her pillows
van helsing returned in a couple of hours and presently said to me now you go home and eat much and drink enough
make yourself strong
i stay here tonight and i shall sit up with little miss myself
you and i must watch the case and we must have none other to know
i have grave reasons
no do not ask me
think what you will
do not fear to think even the most not improbable
goodnight
in the hall two of the maids same time and asked if they of either of them might not sit up with miss lucy
they implored me to let them and when i said it was dr.
van helsing's wish that either he or i should sit up they asked me quite piteously to intercede with the' foreign gentleman'
i was much touched by their kindness
perhaps it is because i am weak at present and perhaps because it was on lucy's account that their devotion was manifested
for over and over again have i seen similar instances of woman's kindness
i got back here on time for a late dinner went my rounds all well and set this down whilst waiting for sleep
it is coming
september
this afternoon i went over to gillingham
found van helsing in excellent spirits and lucy much better
shortly after i had arrived a big parcel from abroad came for the professor
he opened it with much impress me nt assumed of course and showed a great bundle of white flowers
these are for you miss lucy he said
for me
oh dr
van helsing
he's my dear but not for you to play with
these are medicines
here lucy made a wry face
msg but they are not to take in a decoction or in nauseous form so you need not snub that so charming nose or i shall point out to my friend arthur what does he may have to endure in seeing so much beauty that he so loved so much distort
zhang pretty miss that bring the so nice nose all straight again
this is medicinal but you do not know how
i put him in your window i make pretty wreath and hang him round your neck so you sleep well
oh yes
they like the lotus flower make your trouble forgotten
it smells i like the waters if let me and of that fountain of youth that the conquistadors's sought for in the florida's and find him all too late
whilst he was speaking lucy had been examining the flowers and smelling them
now she threw them down saying with half laughter and half disgust oh professor i believe you are only putting up a joke on me
why these flowers are only common garlic
to my surprise van helsing rose up and said with all his sternness his irony asset and his bushy eyebrows meeting no. trifling with me
in every est
there is trim purpose in what i do and i warn you that you do not thwart me
take care for the sake of others if not for your own
then seeing poor lucy scared as she might well be he went on more gently on little miss my dear do not fear me
i only do for your good but there is much virtue to you in those so common flowers
see i place them myself in your room
i make myself the wreath that you are to wear
but bush
no telling to others that make so inquisitive questions
we must obey and silence is a part of obedience and obedience is to bring you strong and well into loving arms that wait for you
now sit still a while
come with me friend john and you shall help me deck the room with my garlic which is all the way from haarlem where my friend vanderpool raise her big his glass houses all the year
i had to telegraph yesterday or they would not have been here
we went into the room taking the flowers with us
the professor's actions were certainly odd and not to be found in any pharmacopeia that i ever heard of
view the fastened up the windows and latched them securely
next taking a handful of the flowers he rubbed them all over the sashes as though to ensure that every whiff of air that might get in. would be laden with the garlic smell
then with the wisp he rubbed all over the jamb of the roof above below and at each side and round the fireplace in the same way
it all seemed grotesque tome and presently i said well professor i know you always have a reason for what you do but this certainly puzzles me
it is well we have no sceptic here or he would say that you were working some spell to keep out an evil spirit
perhaps i am
he answered quietly as he began to make the wreath which lucy was to wear round her neck
we then waited whilst lucy made her toilet for the night and when she was in bed he came and himself fixed the wreath of garlic round her neck
the last words he said to her were take care you do not disturb it and even if the room feel close do not tonight open the window of the door
i promise said lucy
and thank you both a thousand times for all your kindness to me
oh what face is one to be blessed with such friends
as select the house in my fly which was waiting van helsing said tonight i can sleep in peace and sleep i want two nights of travel much reading in the day between and much anxiety on the day to follow and a night to sit up without how ink
tomorrow in the morning early you call for me and we come together to see our pretty miss so much more strong for my' spell' which i have work
ho ho
he seemed so confident that i remember inf my own confidence two nights before and with the baneful result felt awe and vague terror
it must have been my weakness that made me hesitate to tell it to my friend but i felt it all the more like in shed tears
chapter lucy westenra's diary september
how good they all are home
i quite love that dear dr.
van helsing
i wonder why he was so anxious about these flowers
he positively frightened me he was so fierce
and yet he must have been right for i feel comfort from them already
somehow i do not dread being alone tonight and i can go to sleep without fear
i shall not mind any flapping outside the window
on the terrible struggle that i have had against sleep so often of late the pain of sleeplessness of the pain of the fear of sleep and with such unknown horrors as it has forms
how blessed are some people whose lives have no fear snow reader is not sleep is a blessing that comes nightly and brings nothing but sweet dreams
well here i am tonight hoping for sleep and lying like ophelia in the play with' virgins rants and maidens grew ments
' i never liked garlic before but tonight it is delightful
there is peace in its smell
i feel sleep coming already
goodnight everybody
dr
seward's diary september
called at the berkeley and found van helsing as usual up to time
the carriage ordered from the hotel was waiting
the professor took his bag which he always brings with him now
i shall be put down exactly
van helsing and i arrived at gillingham at eighto'clock
it was a lovely morning
the bright sunshine and all the fresh feeling of early autumn seemed like the completion of nature's annual work
the leaves were turning to all kinds of beautiful colours but had not yet begun to drop from the trees
when we entered we hermes
westenra coming out of the morning room
she is always an early riser
she greeted us warmly and said you will be glad to know that lucy is better
the dear child is still asleep
i looked into her room and saw her but did not goin lest i should disturb her
the professor smiled and looked quite jubilant
he rubbed his hands together and said at a
i thought i had diagnosed the case
my treatment is working
to which she replied you must not take all the credit to yourself doctor
lucy's state this morning issue in part time
how do you meanma'am
asked the professor
well i was anxious about the dear child in the night and went into her room
she was sleeping soundly so soundly that even my coming did not wake her
but the room was awfully stuffy
there were a lot of those horrible strong smelling flowers about everywhere and she had actually a bunch of them round her neck
i feared that the head to do it would be too much for the dear child in her weak state so i took them all away and opened a bit of the window to let in a little fresh air
you will be pleased with her i am sure
she moved off into her boudoir where she usually breakfasted early
as she had spoken i watched the professor's face and saw it turns chen gray
he had been able to retain his self command whilst the poor lady was present for he knew her state and how mischievous a shock would be
he actually smiled on her as he held open the door for her to pass into her room
but the instant she had disappeared he pulled me suddenly and forcibly into the dining room and closed the door
then for the first time in my life i saw van helsing breakdown
he raised his hands over his head in a sort of mute despair and then beat his palms together in a helpless day
finally he sat down on a chair and putting his hands before his face began to sob with loud cry dogs that seemed to come from the very racking of his heart
then he raised his arms again as though appealing to the whole universe
god
gps
god
he said
what have we done what has this poor thing done that we are so sore be set
is the debate amongst us still send down from the pagan world of old that such things must be and in such way
this poor mother all unknowing and all for the best as she think does such thing as lose her daughter body and soul and we must not tell her we must not even warn her or she did then both die
oh how we are beset
how are all the powers of the devil's against us
suddenly he jumped to his feet
come he said come we must see and act
devils or no devils or all the devil's at once it matters not
we must fight him all the same
he went to the hall door for his bag and together we went up to lucy's room
once again i drew up the blind whilst van helsing went towards the bed
this time he did not start as he looked on the poor face with the same awful waxen pallor as before
he wore a look of stern sadness and infinite pity
as i expected he murmured with that missing inspiration of his which meant so much
without a word he went and locked the door and then began to set out on the little table the instruments for yet another operation of transfusion of blood
i had long ago recognized the necessity and begun to take off my coat but he stopped me with a warning hand
no
he said
today you must operate
i shall provide
you are weakened already
as he spoke he took off his coat and rolled up his short sleeve
again the operation
stair the narcotic
again some return of colour to the as my cheeks and the regular breathing of healthy sleep
this time i watched whilst van helsing recruited himself and tested
presently he took an opportunity of telling me s
westenra that she must not remove anything from lucy's room without consulting him
that the flowers were of medicinal value and that the breathing of their odour was a part of the system of cure
then he took over the care of the case himself as ying that he would watch this night and the next and would send me word when to come
after another hour lucy wakes from her sleep fresh and bright and seemingly not much the worse for her terrible ordeal
what does it all mean
i am beginning to wonder if my long habit of life amongst the insane is beginning to tell upon my own brain
lucy westenra's diary september
four days and nights of peace
i am getting so strong again that i hardly know myself
it is as if i had passed through some long nightmare and had just awakened to see the beautiful sunshine and feel the fresh air of the morning around me
i have a sum half remembrance of long anxious times of waiting and fearing darkness in which there was not even the pain of hope to make present distress more poignant
and then long spells of oblivion and the rising back to life as a diver coming up through a great press of water
since however dr
van helsing has been with me all this bad dreaming seems to have passed away
the noises that used to frighten me out of my wits the flapping against the windows the distant voices which seemed so close to me the harsh sounds that came from i know not where and commanded me to do i know not what have all ceased
i go to bed now without any fear of sleep
i do not even try to keep awake
i have grown quite fond of the garlic and a box ful arrives for me everyday from haarlem
tonight dr
van helsing is going away as he has to be for a day in amsterdam
but i need not be watched
i am well enough to be left alone
thank god for mother's sake and dear arthur's and for all our friends who have been so kind
i shall not even feel the change for last night dr
van helsing slept in his chair a lot of the time
i found him asleep twice when i awoke
but i did not fear to go to sleep again although the boughs of bars or something flapped almost angrily against the window panes
the pall mall gazette september
the escaped wolf perilous adventure of our interviewer interview with the keeper in the zoological gardens after many inquiries and almost as many refusals and perpetually using the words' pall mall gazette' as a sort of talisman i managed to find the keeper of the section of the zoological gardens in which the wolf department is included
thomas bilder lives in one of the cottages in the enclosure behind the elephant house and was just sitting down to his tea when i found him
thomas and his wife are hospitable folk elderly and without children and is the specimen i enjoyed of their hospitality be of the average kind their lives must be pretty comfortable
the keeper would not enter on what he called business until the supper was over and we were all satisfied
then when the table was cleared and he had lit his pipe he said how did you can go on a near somewhat you want
you'll ex close here food in' to talk of perfect una is unjust safire meals
i gives the wolves and the jackals and the hyenas in all our section their texaco fri begins to adsl them questions
how do you mean ask them questions
i queried wishful to get him into a talkative humor
' it tin' of them over the' ead with apple is one way
scratch in' of their ears on another when gents as is flush wants a bit of a show off to their gals
idon't so much mind the dust the' it tin of the pole parts for six bucks in their dinner but i wait still they've' as their sherry and law free so to speak adore it goes on with the ear scratch in'
mind you he added philosophically there's a deal of the same nature in us asin them the frank miles
here's you a comin' and wrekin' of me questions about my business and i that grill like that only for your bloomin'' are quid i'd's' seen you blower dust' fore i'd answer
not even when you are led be sarcastic like if i'd like you to a rsi the superintendent if you might at some questions
without offence did i tell her to go to' ell
you did
an' when you said you'd report me focus on' obscene language that was' it tin' me over the' ead
but the' are quid made that all right
iweren'ta goin' to fight do i waited for the food and did with my' owl as the wolves and lions and tigers does
but log' love her' art now that the old'll man has stuck a chunk of her tea cake in mean' rinsed me out with her bloomin' old teapot and i've lift up you may scratch my ears for all you're worth andwon't even get a growl out of me
drive along with your questions
i know what her a comin' at that's're escaped wolf
exactly
i want you to give me your view of it
just tell me how it happened and when i know the facts i'll get you to say what you consider was the cause of it and how you think the whole affair will end
all right t u v' nor
this' ere is about the' old story
that's redo of what we called her sicker was one of three gray ones that came from norway to jam each's which we bought off him four years ago
he was a nice well behaved wolf that never have no trouble to talk of
i'm more surprised at' in for wantin' to get out nor any other ani mile in the place
but there youvan't trust wolves no more hot women
don't you kind him air
broke in mrs.
tom with a cheery laugh
's's not mind in' the ani miles so long that goes to theain'ti iowa old wolf' is self
but there ain' tho' admin' in
wells if it was about two hours after feed on' yesterday when i first hear my disturbance
i was makin' up a litter in the monkey house for a young puma which is ill
but when i heard the yellin' and' owl in'll em away straight
there was berwick era tearin' like a mad thing at the bars as if he wanted to get out
there wasn't much people about that day and close at hand was only one man at all thin chap with a' ook nose and a pointed fears with a few white hairs runnin' through it
he had a' add cold look and red eyes and i took a sort of his like to him for it seemed as if it was' i'm as they wash irritated at
be' ad white kid gloves on' is' and send he pointed out the ani milestone and says' keeper these wolves seem to set at something
'' maybe it's you' says it or i did not like the air was he give' is self
he didn't get angry as i'll edge would but he smiled a kind of insolent smile with a mouth full of white sharp teeth
' oh no theywouldn't like me'' r days
' ow yes they would'' says izumi hatin' of him
' they always like a bone or two to clean their teeth on about tea time which you' as a bag ful
' well it was a odd thing but when the ani miles see usa talkin' they lay down and when i went over movers is kernels the stroke his ears same as ever
that there manke mover and blessed but if he didn't put in his hand and stroke the old wolf's ears top
' tyke care' says l
' bar sucker is quick
'' never mind' he says
i'm used to' em
'' are you in the business yourself
' i say styling off my' at for a man what trades in wolves and free erisa good friend to keepers
' non'' says he' not exactly in the business but i' ace made pets of several
' and with that he lifts his's tax perlite as a lord and walks away
'll ever did merkel's lookin' after' until i'd was out of sight and then went and lay down in a corner andwouldn't comet out the' open evening
well karst night so soon as the moon wash up the wolves here all began a' idling
therewarn't nothing for them to' owl at
therewarn't no one near except someone that was evidently a callin' a dog somewhere's outback of the harding's in the park road
once or twice i went out to see that all was tight and it was and then the' idling stopped
just before twelveo'clock i just took a look round score turnin' in an' bush me but when i key opposite tools her sucker's cage i see the rails broken and twisted about and the cave empty
and that's all i know forced time
did anyone else see anything
one of our hard' gets was a comin'' one about that time from a' s t mony when he sees a big graydon comin' out through the garding' edges
at least some ways but idon't give much for it myself for if he did's never said a word about it to his miss is when's got' one and it was only after the escape of the wolf was made known and we had been up all night a huntin' of the park corner sicker that he remembered seein' anything
my own belief was that the' arkon y' we got into his' ead
now mr
bilder can you account in any way for the escape of the wolf
wells if he said with a suspicious sort of modesty i think i can but idon't know as' is you'd be satisfied with the theory
certainly is hall
if a man like you who knows the animals from experiencecan't hazard a good guess at any rate who is even to try
well then siri accounts for it this way
it seems to me that's resolve scaled simply because he wanted to get out
from the hearty way that both thomas and his wife laughed at the joke i could see that it had done service before and that the whole explanation was simply an elaborate sell
icouldn't cope in bed i have with the worthy thomas but i thought i knew a surer way to his heart so i said no wmd
bilder we'll consider that first half sovereign worked off and this brother of his is waiting to be claimed when you've told me what you think will happen
eighty' are sighed and briskly
he'll ex close me i know for a chaffin' if ye but the old woman here winked at me which was as much as telling me to go on
well i never
said the old lady
my opinion is this that's're wolf is a' i don' on somewhere s
they are' need it didn't remember said he was a gallop in' northward faster than a horse could go but idon't believe him for her sees it wolvesdon't gallop no more hot dogs does they not be in' built that way
wolves is fine things in a storybook and is essay when they gets in packs and does bdc high in' somethin' that's modes feared than they is they can make a devil of a noise and chop it up whatever it is
but log' bless you in real life a wolf is only a low creature not half so clever or bold as a good dog and not half a quarter so much fightin' in
this onewon't been used to fightin' or even to provid in' for his self and more like he's somewhere round the parks' hid in' an's' shiver in' pe and if he thinks at all wonderin' where he is to get his breakfast from
or maybe he's got down some area and is in a coal cellar
my eyewon't some cool get a run start when she sees his green eyes a shinin' s t her out of the dark
if he can'd get food he's bound to look for it and may nap he may chance to light on a butcher's shop in time
if hedoesn't and some nursemaid goes out walkin' or off with a soldier leavin' of them infant in the per am by labor well then i shouldn't be surprised if the census is one bag by the less
that's all
i was handing him the half sovereign when something came bobbing up against the window and mr.
bilder's face doubled its natural length with surprise
god bless me
he said
if there ain' told her sicker comeback by' is self
he went to the door and opened its most unnecessary proceeding it seemed to me
i have always thought that a wild animal never looks so well as when some obstacle of pronounced durability is between us
a personal experience has intensified rather than diminished that idea
after all however there is nothing like custom for neither bilder nor his wife thought anymore of the wolf than i should of a dog
the animal itself was a peaceful and well behaved as that father of all picture wolves red riding hood'squ'on dam friend whilst moving her confidence in masquerade
the whole scene was a unutterable mixture of comedy and pathos
the wicked wild that for a half a day had paralyzed london and set all the children in town shivering in their shoes was there in a sort of penitent mood and was received and petted like a sort of full one prodigal son
old bilder examined him all over with most tender solicitude and when he had finished with his penitent said there i knew the poor old chap would get into some kind of trouble
didn'ti say it all along
here's his head all cut and full of broken glass
'd's been a gettin' over some bloomin' wall or other
it'sa why me that people are allowed to top their walls with broken bottles
this' ere's what comes of it
come along her sicker
he took the wolf and locked him up in a cage with a piece of meat that satisfied in quantity at any rate the elementary conditions of the fatted calf and went off to report
i came off too to report the only exclusive information that is given today regarding the strange escapade at the zoo
dr
seward's diary september
i was engaged after dinner in my study posting up my books which through press of other work and the many visits to lucy had fallen sadly into a great
suddenly the door was burst open and i brushed my patient with his face distorted with passion
i was thunderstruck for such a thing as a patient getting of his own accord into the superintendent's study is almost unknown
without an instant's notice he made straight at me
he had a dinner knife in his hand and as i saw he was dangerous i tried to keep the table between us
he was too quick and too strong for me however for before i could get my balance he had struck at me and cut my left wrist rather severely
before he could strike again however i got in my right hand and he was sprawling on his back on the floor
my wrist bled freely and quite a little pool trickled onto the carpet
i saw that my friend was not intent on further effort and occupied myself binding up my wrist keeping a wary eye on the prostrate figure all the time
when the attendants rushed in and we turned our attention to him his employment positively sickened me
he was lying on his belly on the floor picking up like a dog the blood which had fallen from my wounded wrist
he was easily secured and to my surprise went with the attendant's quite placidly simply repeating over and over again the blood is the life
the blood is the life
i can not afford to lose blood just at present
i have lost too much of late for my physical good and then the prolonged strain of lucy's illness and its horrible phases is telling on me
i am over excited and weary and i need rest re street
happily van helsing has not summoned me so i need not forego my sleep
tonight i could not well do without it
telegram van helsing antwerp to seward carfax sent to carfax sussex as no county given delivered late by twenty two hours

dr
seward's diary september
justice train to london
the arrival of van helsing's telegram filled me with dismay
a whole night lost and i know by bitter experience a bar may happen in a night
of course it is possible that all maybe we'll but what may have happened
surely there is some horrible room hanging over us that every possible accident should thwart is in all we try to go
i shall take this cylinder with me and then i can complete my entry on lucy's phonograph
memorandum left by lucy westenra september night
i write this and leave it to be seen so that no one may by any chance get into trouble through me
this is an exact record of what took place tonight
i feel i am dying of weakness and have barely strength to write but it must be done if i die in the boing
i went to bed as usual taking care that the flowers were placed as dr.
van helsing directed and soon fell asleep
i was asked by the flapping at the window which had begun after that sleep walking on the cliff at whitby when mina saved me and which now i know sowell
i was not afraid but i did wish that dr
seward was in the next room addr
van helsing said he would be so that i might have called him
i tried to sleep but i could not
then there came to me the old fear of sleep and i determined to keep awake
perversely sleep would try to come then when i did not want it
so as i feared to be alone i opened my door and called out is there anybody there
there was no answer
i was afraid to wake mother and so closed my door again
then outside in the shrubbery i heard a sort of how i like a dog's but more fierce and deeper
i went to the window and looked out but could see nothing except a big fat which had evidently been buffering its wings against the window
so i went back to bed again but determined not to go to sleep
presently the door opened and mother looked in
seeing by my moving that i was not asleep she came in and sat by me
she said to me even more sweetly and softly than her wont i was uneasy about you darling and came into see that you were all right
i feared she might catch cold sitting there and asked her to come in and sleep with me so she came into bed and lay down beside me
she did not take off her dressing gown for she said she would only stay awhile and then go back to her own bed
as she lay there in my arms and iib here the flapping and buffering came to the window again
she was startled and a little frightened and cried out what is that
i tried to pacify her and at last succeeded and she lay quiet
but i could hear her poor dear heart still beating terribly
after a while there was the bowl again out in the shrubbery and shortly after there was a crash at the window and a lot of broken glass was buried on the floor
the window blind flew back with the wind that rushed in and in the aperture of the broken lanes there was the head of a great gaunt gray wolf
mother cried out in a bright and struggled up into a sitting posture and clutched wildly at anything that would help her
amongst other things she clutched the wreath of flowers that dr
van helsing insisted on my wearing round my neck and tore it away from md
for a second or two she sat up pointing at the wolf and there was a strange and horrible gurgling in her throat
then she fell over as it struck with lightning and her head hit my forehead and made me dizzy for a moment or two
the room and all round seemed to spin found
i kept my eyes fixed on the window but the wolf drew his head back and a whole myriad of little specks seems to come blowing in through the broken window and wheeling and circling round like the pillar of dust that travellers describe when there is a so moon in the desert
i tried to stir but there was some spell upon me and dear mother's poor body which seemed to grow cold already for her death east had ceased to beat weighed me down and i remembered no more for awhile
the time did not seen long but very very awful till i recovered consciousness again
so mean sea near a passing bell was rolling
the dogs all round the neighbourhood were howling and in our shrubbery seemingly just outside a nightingale was singing
i was dazed and stupid with pain and terror and weakness but the sound of the nightingale seemed like the voice of my dear mother come back to comfort me
the sounds seemed to have awakened the maid stop for i could hear their bare feet pattering outside my door
i called to them and they came in and when they saw what had happened and what it was that lay over me on the bed they screamed out
the wind rushed in through the broken window and the door slammed to
they lifted off the body of my dear mother and laid her covered up with a sheet on the bed after i had got up
they were all so frightened and nervous that i directed them to go to the dining room and each have a glass of wine
the door flew open for an instant and closed again
the maids shrieked and then went in a body to the dining room and i laid what flowers i had on my dear mother's breast
when they were there i remembered what dr.
van helsing had told me but i didn't like to remove them and besides i would have some of the servants to sit up with me now
i was surprised that the maids did not come back
i called them but got no answer so i went to the dining room to look for them
my heart sank when i saw what had happened
they all four lay helpless on the floor breathing heavily
the decanter of sherry was on the table half full but there was a queer as did smell about
i was suspicious and examined the decanter
it smelt of laudanum and looking on the sideboard i found that the bottle which mother's doctor uses for her ou
did use was empty
what amoroso
what am i todo
i am back in the room with mother
i can not leave her and i am alone save for the sleeping servants whom someone has drugged
alone with the dead
i dare not go out for i can hear the low howl of the wolf through the broken window
the air seems full of specks floating and circling in the draught from the window and the lights born blue and dim
what am i todo
god shield me from harm this night
i shall hide this paper in my breast where they shall find it when they come to lay me out
my dear mother none
it is time that i go too
goodbye dear arthur if i should not survive this night
god keep your ear and god help me
chapter dr
seward's diary september
i drove at once to gillingham and arrived early
keeping my cab at the gate i went up the avenue alone
i knocked gently and ran has quietly as possible for i feared to disturb lucy or her mother and hoped to only bring a servant to the door
after a while finding no response i knocked and rang again still no answer
i cursed the laziness of the servants that they should lie a bed at such an hour for it was now teno'clock and sprang and knocked again but more impatiently but still without response
hitherto i had blamed only the servants but now a terrible fear began to assail me
was this desolation but another link in the chain of doom which seemed drawing tight round us
was it indeed a house of death to which i had come too late
i know that minute seven seconds of delay might mean hours of danger to lucy if she had had again one of those frightful relapses and i went found the house to try if i could find by chance an entry anywhere
i could find no means of ingress
every window and door was fastened and locked and i returned baffled to the porch
as i did so i heard the rapid pit pat of a swiftly driven horse's feet
they stopped at the gate and a few seconds later in st. van helsing running up the avenue
when he saw me he gasped out then it was you and just arrived
how issue
are we too late
did you not get my telegram
i answered as quick lu and coherently as i could that i had only to this telegram early in the morning and had not a minute incoming here and that i could not make anyone in the house hear me
he paused and raised his hat as he said solemnly then i fear we are too late
god's will be done
with his usual recuperative energy he went on some
if there be no way open to get in. we must make one
time is all in all to us now
we went round to the back of the house where there was a kitchen window
the professor took a small surgical saw from his case and handing it to me pointed to the iron bars which guarded the window
i attacked them at once and had very soon cut through three of them
then with a long thin knife we pushed back the fastening of the washes and opened the window
i helped the professor in and followed him
there was no one in the kitchen or in the servants' rooms which were close at hand
we tried all the rooms as we went along and in the dining room dimly lit by rays of light through the shutters found four servant women lying on the floor
there was no need to think them dead for the irs terror lu's breathing and the act of smell of laudanum in the room left no doubt as to their condition
van helsing and i looked at eachother and as we moved away he said we can attend to them later
then we ascended to lucy's room
for an instant or two we paused at the door to listen but there was no sound that we could hear
with white faces and trembling hands we opened the door gently and entered the room
how shall i describe what we saw
on the verlag two women lucy and her mother
the latter lay farthest in and she was covered with a white sheet the edge of which had been blown back by the drought through the broken window showing the drawn white face with a look of terror fixed upon it
by her side lay lucy with face white and still more drawn
the flowers which had been found her neck we found upon her mother's bosom and her throat was hard showing the two little wounds which we had noticed before but looking horribly white and mangled
without a word the professor bent over the new his head almost touching poor lucy's breast
then he gave a quick turn of his head as of one who listens and leaping to his feet he cried out to me it is not yet too late
quick
quick
bring the brandy
i flew down stairs and returned with it taking care to smell and tax re it lest it too were drugged like the decanter of sherry which i found on the table
the maids were still breathing but more restlessly and i fancied that the narcotic was wearing off
i did not stay to make sure but returned to van helsing
he rubbed the brand jason another occasion on her lips and gums and on her wrists and the palms of her hands
he said to me i can do this all that can be at the present
you to wake those maids
click them in the face with a wet towel and click them hard
make them gettext and fire and a warm bath
this poor soul is nearly as cold as that beside her
she will need be heated before we can do anything more
i went at once and found little difficulty in waking three of the women
the fourth was only a young girl and the drug had evidently affected her more strongly so i lifted her on the sofa and let her sleep
the others were razed at first but we remembrance came back to them they cried and sobbed in a hysterical manner
i was stern with them however and would not let them talk
i told them that one life was bad enough to lose and if they delayed they would sacrifice miss lucy
so sobbing and crying they went about their way half clad as they were and prepared fire and water
fortunately the kitchen and boiler fires were still alive and there was no lack of hot water
we got a bath and carried lucy out as she was and placed her in it
whilst we were busy sharing her limbs there was a knock at the hall door
one of the maids ran off hurried on some more clothes and opened it
then she returned and whispered to us that there was a gentleman who had come with a message from me
holmwood
i bade her simply tell him that he must wait for we could see no one now
she went away with the message and engrossed with our work i clean forgot all about him
i never saw in all my experience the professor work in such deadly earnest
i knew as he knew that it was a stand upright with death and in a pause told him so
he answered me in a way that i did not understand but with the stern est look that his face could wear
if that were all i would stop here where we are now and let her fade away into peace for i see no light in life over her horizon
he went on with his work with it possible renewed and more frenzied vigour
presently we both began to be conscious that the heat was beginning to be of some effect
lucy's heartbeat a trifle more audibly to the stethoscope and her lungs had a perceptible movement
van helsing's face almost framed and as we lifted her from the bath and rolled her in a hot sheet to dry her he said to me the first gain is ours
check to the king
we took lucy into another room which had by now been prepared and laid men in bed and forced a few drops of brandy down her throat
i noticed that van helsing tied a soft silk handkerchief round her throat
she was still unconscious and was quite as bad as if not worse than we had ever seen her
van helsing called in one of the women and told her to stay with her and not to take her eyes off her till we returned and then beckoned me out of the room
we must consult as to what is to be done he said as we descended the stairs
in the hall he opened the dining room door and we passed in. he closing the door carefully behind him
the shutters had been opened but the blinds were already down with that obedience to the etiquette of death which the british woman of the lower classes always rigidly observed
the room was therefore dimly dark
it was however light enough for our purposes
van helsing's sternness was somewhat relieved by a look of perplexity
he was evidently torturing his mind about something so i waited for an instant and he spoke
what are we to do now
where are we to turn for help
we must have another transfusion of blood and that soon or that poor girl's lifewon't be worth an hour's purchase
you are exhausted already
i am exhausted top
i fear to trust those women even if they would have courage to submit
what are we to do for someone who will open his veins for her
what's the matter with me anyhow
the voice came from the sofa across the room and it stones brought relief and joy to my heart for they were those of quincey morris
van helsing started angrily at the first sound but his face softened and a glad look came into his eyes as i cried out quincey morris
and rushed towards him with outstretched hands
what brought you here
i cried as our hands met
i guess artist because
he handed me a telegram
' have not heard from seward for three days and am terribly anxious
can not leave
father still in same condition
send me word how lucy is
do not delay
holmwood
' i think i came just in the nick of time
you know you have only to tell me what to do
van helsing strode forward and took his hand looking him straight in the eyes as he said a brave man's blood is the best thing on this earth when a woman is in trouble
you're a man and no mistake
well the devil may work against us for all he's worth but god sends us men when we want them
once again we went through that ghastly operation
i have not the heart to go through with the details
lucy had got a terrible shock and it told on her more than before for though plenty of blood went into her veins her body did not respond to the treatment as well as on the other occasions
her struggle back into life was something frightful to see and hear
however the action if both heart and lungs improved and van helsing made a subcutaneous injection of morphix as before and with good effect
her faint became a profound slumber
the professor watched whilst i went downstairs with quincey morris and sent one of the maids to pay off one of the cab men who were waiting
i left quincey lying down after having a glass of wine and told the cook to get ready a good breakfast
then a thought struck me and i went back to the room where lucy now was
when i came softly in i found van helsing with a sheet or two of notepaper in his hand
he had evidently read it and was thinking it over as he sat with his hand to his brow
there was a look of grim satisfaction in his face as of one who has had a doubt solved
he handed me the paper saying only it dropped from lucy's breast when we carried her to the bath
when i had read it is good looking at the professor and after a pause asked him in god's name what does it all mean
was she or i schema for what sort of horrible danger is it
i was so bewildered that i did not know what to say more
van helsing put out his hand and took the paper saying do not trouble about it now
forget it for the present
you shall know and understand it all in good time but it will be later
and now what is it that you came to me to say
this brought me back to fast and i was all myself again
i came to speak about the certificate of death
if we do not act properly and wisely there may be an inquest and that paper would have to be produced
i am in hopes that we need have no inquest for if we had it would surely kill poor lucy if nothing else did
i know and you know and the other doctor who attended her knows that mrs.
westenra had disease of the heart and we can certify that she died of it
let us fill up the certificate at once and i shall take it myself to the registrar and go into the undertaker
good oh my friend john
well thought of
truly miss lucy if she bread in the first haynes ether is at least happy in the friends that love her
one two three all open their veins for her besides one old man
ah yes i know this nv john
i am not blind
i love you all the more for it
now go
in the hall i met quincey morris with a telegram for arthur telling him that mds
westenra was dead that lucy also had been ill but dawn of going on better and that van helsing and i were with her
i told him where i was going and he hurried me out but as i was going said when you come back jack may i have two words with you all to ourselves
i nodded in reply and went out
i found no difficulty about the registration and arranged with the local undertaker to come up in the evening to measure for the coffin and to make arrangements
when i got back quincey was waiting for me
i told him i would see him as soon as i knew about lucy and went up to bedroom
she was still sleeping and the professor seemingly had not moved from his seat at her side
from his putting his finger to his lips i gathered that he expected her to wake before long and was afraid of forestalling nature
so i went down to quincey and took him into the breakfast room where the blinds were not drawn down and which was a little more cheerful or rather less cheer less than the other rooms
when we were alone he said to me jack seward idon't want to shore myself in anywhere where i've no right to be but this is no ordinary case
you know i loved that girl and wanted to marry her but although that's all past and gone ocan't help feeling anxious about her all the same
what is it that's wrong with her
the dutchman and a fine old fellow he is i can see that said that time you two came into the room that you must have another transfusion of blood and that both you and he were exhausted
now i know well that you medical men speak in camera and that a man must not expect to know what they consult about in private
but this is no common matter and whatever it is i have done my part
is not that so
that's so i said and he went on
i take it that both you and van helsing had done already what i did today
is not that so
that's so
and i guess art was in it too
when i saw him four days ago down at his own place he looked queer
i have not seen anything pulled down so quick since i was on the pampas and hadamard that i was fond of goto grass all in a night
one of those big bats that they call vampires had to gather in the night and stay with his gorge and the vein left open there wasn't enough blood in her to let her stand up and i had to put a bullet through her as she lay
jack if you may tell me without betraying confidence arthur was the first is not that so
as he spoke the poor fellow looked terribly anxious
he was in a torture of suspense regarding the woman he loved and his utter ignorance of the terrible mystery which seemed to surround her intensified his pain
his very heart was bleeding and it took all the manhood of him and there was a royal lot of it too to keep him from breaking down
i paused before answering for i felt that i must not betray anything which the professor wished kept secret but already he knew so much and guessed so much that there could be no reason for not answering so i answered in the same phrase
that's co
and how long has this been going on
about ten days
ten days
then i guess jack seward that that poor pretty creature that we all love has had put into her veins within that time the floor of four strong men
man alive her whole bodywouldn't hold it
then coming close to me he spoke in a fierce half whisper
what took it out
i shook my head
that i said is the crux
van helsing is simply frantic about it and i am at my wits' end
ican't even hazards guess
there has been a series of little circumstances which have thrown out all our calculations as to lucy being properly watches
but these shall not occur again
here we stay until all be well or ill
quincey held out his hand
count me in. he said
you and the dutchman will tell me what to do and i'll do it
when she woke late in the afternoon lucy's first movement was to feel in her breast and to my surprise produced the paper which van helsing had given me to read
the careful professor had replaced it where it had come from keston saying she should be alarmed
her eyes then put on van helsing and on me too and gladdened
then she looked round the room and seeing where she was shuddered
she gave a loud cry and put her poor thin hands before her pale face
we both under's food what was meant that she had realized to the full her mother's death
so we tried what we could to comfort her
doubtless sympathy eased her somewhat but she was very low in thought and spirit and wept silently and weakly for a long time
we told her that either or both of use luke now remain with her all the time and that seemed to comfort her
towards dusk she fell into a dose
here a very odd thing occurred
whilst still asleep she took the paper from her breast and tore it in two
van helsing stepped over and took the pieces from her
all the same however she went on with the action of hearing as though the material were still in her hands
finally she lifted her hands and opened them as though scattering the fragments
van helsing seemed surprised and his brows gathered as if in thought but he said nothing
september
all last night she slept fitfully being always afraid to sleep and something weaker when she woke from it
the processor and i took in turns to watch and we never left her for a moment unattended
quincey morris said nothing about his intention but i knew that all night long he patrolled round and round the house
when the day came its searching light showed the ravages in poor lucy's strength
she was hardly able to turn her head and the little nourishment which she could take seemed to voted no good
at times she slept and both van helsing and i noticed the difference in her between sleeping and waking
whilst asleep she looked stronger although more haggard and her breathing was softer
her open mouth showed the pale guns drawn back from the teeth which looked positively longer and sharper than usual
when she woke the softness of her eyes evidently changed the expression for she looked her own self although a dying one
in the afternoon she asked for arthur and we telegraphed for him
quincey went off to meet him at the station
when he arrived it was nearly sixo'clock and the sun was setting full and warm and the red light streamed in through the window and have more colour to the pale cheeks
when he saw her arthur was simply choking with emotion and none of us could speak
in the hours that had passed the bits of sleep or the comatose condition that passed for it had grown more frequent so that the pauses when conversation was possible we rest of genes
arthur's presence however seemed to act as a stimulant
she rallied a little and spoke to him more brightly than she had done since we arrived
he too pulled himself together and spoke as cheerily as he could so that the best was made of everything
it is now nearly oneo'clock and he and van helsing are sitting with her
i am to relieve them in a quarter of an hour and i am entering this on lucy's phonograph
until sixo'clock they are to try to rest
i fear that tomorrow will end our watching for the shock had been too great
the poor child can not rally
god help us all
let term in a marker to lucy westenra unopened by her september my dearest lucy it seems an age since i heard from you or indeed since i wrote

hawkins
he took us to his house where there were rooms for us all nice and comfortable and we dined together
after dinner mr
hawkins said' my fears i want to drink your health and prosperity and may every blessing attend you both
i know you both from children and have with love and pride seen you grow up
now i want you to make your home here with me
i have left to me neither chick nor child
all are gone and in my will i have left you everything
' i cried lucy dear as jonathan and the old man clasped hands
our evening was a very very happy one
so here we are installed in this beautiful old house and from both my bedroom and the drawing room i can see the great elms of the cathedral close with their great black stems standing out against the old yellowstone of the cathedral and i can hear the rooms overhead casing and sawing and chattering and chattering and gossiping all day after the manner of rooms and humans
i am busy i need not tell you arranging things and housekeeping
jonathan and mr.
hawkins are busy all day for now that jonathan is a partner mr
hawkins wants to tell him all about the clients
how is your dear mother getting on
i wish i could run up to town for a day or two to see you wear but i dare not go get with so much on my shoulders and jonathan wants looking after still
he is beginning to put some flesh on his bones again but he was terribly weakened by the long illness
even now he sometimes starts out of his sleep in a sudden way and awakes all trembling until i can coax him back to his usual'll acidity
however thank god these occasions grow less frequent as the day ago on and they will in time pass away altogether i trust
and now i have told you my news let me ask your e
when are you to be married and where and who is to perform the ceremony and what are you to wear and is it to be a public or private wedding
tell me all about it dear tell me all about everything for there is nothing which interests you which will not be dead home

goodbye my dearest luck and blessings on you
your china market report from patrick hennessey md me calm as pierce tv to john seward md september my dear sir in accordance with your wishes i enclose report of the conditions of everything left in my charge
with regard to patient renfield there is more to say
he has had another outbreak which might have had a dreadful ending but which as it fortunately happened was unattended with any unhappy results
this afternoon a carrier's cart with two men made a call at the empty house whose grounds abu honours the house to which you will remember the patient twice ran away
the men stopped at our gate to ask the porter their way as they were strangers
i was myself looking out of the study window having a smoke after dinner and saw one of them come up to the house
as he passed the window often field's go on the patient began to rate him from within and called him all the foul name she could lay his tongue to
the man who seemed a decent fellow enough contented himself by telling him to' shut up for a foul mouthed beggar's here on our man accused him of robbing him and wanting to murder him and said that he would hinder him if he were to swing for it
i opened the window and signed to the man nor to notice some contented himself after looking the place over and making up his mind as to what kind of place he has got to by saying' log' bless her siriwouldn't mind what was said to me in a bloomin' madhouse
i pity he and then u v' nor for havin' to live in the house with a wild beast like that
' then he asked his way civilly enough and i told him where the gate of the empty house was
he went away followed by threats and curses and re filings from our man
i went down to see if i could make out any cause for his anger since he is usually such a well behaved man and except his violent tits nothing of the kind had ever occurred
i found him to my astonishment quite composed and most genial in his manner
i tried to get him to talk of the incident but he blandly asked me questions as to what i meant and led me to believe that he was completely oblivious of the affair
it was i am sorry to say however only another instance of his cunning for within half an hour i heard of him again
this time he had broken out through the window of his room and was running down the avenue
i called to the attendants to follow me and ran after him for i feared he was intent on some mischief
my fear was justified when i saw the same cart which had passed before coming down the road having only some great wooden box az
the men were wiping their foreheads and were flushed in the face as it with violent exercise
before i could get up to him the patient rushed at them and pulling one of them off the cart began to knock his head against the ground
if i had not seized him just at the moment i believe he would have killed the man there and then
the other fellow jumped down and struck him over the head with the butt end of his heavy whip
it was a horrible blow but he did not seem to mind it but seized him also and struggled with the three of us pulling us to and fro as if we were kittens
you know i am no lightweight and the others were both burly jen
at first he was silent in his fighting but as we began to master him and the attendants were putting a strait waistcoat on him he began to shout' i'll frustrate the m
they egan're on me
they chan' t murder me by inches
i'll fight for my lord and master
' and all sorts of similar incoherent ravings
it was with very considerable difficulty that they got him back to the house and put him in the padded room
one of the attendants harry had a finger broken
however i set it all right and he is going on well
the two carriers were at first loud in their threats of actions for damages and promised to rain all the penalties of the law on us
their threats were however mingled with some sort of indirect apology for the defeat of the two of them by a feeble madman
they said that if it had not been for the way their strength had been spent in carrying and raising the heavy boxes to the cart they would have made short work of him
they have as another reason for their defeat the extraordinary state off tough to which they had been reduced by the dusty nature of their occupation and the reprehensible distance from the scene of their labors of any place of public entertainment
i quite understood their drift and after a stiff glass of strong trogir rather more of the same and with each a sovereign in hand they made light of the attack and swore that they would encounter a worse harman any day for the pleasure of meetings o' bloomin' good a bloke's's your correspondent
i took their names and addresses in case they might be needed
they are as follows jack s. miller of ridding's rents king george's road great walworth and thomas snelling peter farley's row guide court bethnal green
they are both in the employment of harris sons moving and shipment company orange master's yard soho
i shall report to you any matter of interest occurring here and shall sure you at once if there is anything of importance
believe me dear sir yours faithfully patrick hennessey
let term in a marker to lucy westenra unopened by her september my dearest lucy such as a'd blow has befallen us
mr
hawkins has died very suddenly
some may not think it so sad for us but we had both come to do love him that it really seems as though we had lost a father
i never knew either gather or mother so that the dear old man's death is a real blow home
jonathan is greatly distressed
it is not only that he feels sorrow deep sorrow for the dead good man who had befriended him all his life and now at the end has treated him like his own son and left him a fortune which to people of our modest bringing up is wealth beyond the dream of avarice but jonathan feels it on another account
he says the amount of responsibility which it puts upon him makes him nervous
he begins to doubt himself
i try to cheer him up and my belief in him helps him to have a belief in himself
but it is here that the grave shock that he experienced tells upon him the most
pj it is too hard that a sweet simple noble strong nature such as his amature which enabled him by our dear good friend's aid to rise from clerk to master in a few years should be so injured that the very essence of its strength ketone
forgive me wear if i worry you with my troubles in the midst of your own happiness but much fear i must tell someone for the strain of keeping up a brave and cheerful appearance to jonathan tries means i have no one here that i can confide in
i'd read coming up to london as we must do that day after tomorrow for poor mr.
hawkins left in his will that he was to be buried in the grave with his father
as there are no relations at all jonathan will have to be chief mourner
i shall try to run over to see you dearest if only for a few minutes
forgive me for troubling you
with all blessings your loving him a marker dr
seward's diary september
only resolution and habit can let me make an entry tonight
i am too miserable too low spirited too sick of the world and all init including life itself that i would not care if i heard this moment the flapping of the wings of the angel of death
and he has been flapping those from wings to some purpose of late lucy's mother and arthur's father and now
let me get on with my work
i duly relieved van helsing in his watch over luck
we wanted arthur to go to rest also but he refused at first
it was only when i told him that we should want him to help us during the day and that we must not all breakdown for want of rest of st. lucy should suffer that he agreed to go
van helsing was very kind to him
come my child he said
come with me
you are sick and weak and have had much sorrow and much mental pain as well as that tax on your strength that we know of
you must not be alone for to be alone is to be full of fears and alarms
come to the drawing room where there is a big fire and there are two sofas
you shall lie on one and i on the other and our sympathy will be comfort to each other even though we do not speak and even if we sleep
arthur went off with him casting back a longinglook on lucy's face which lay in her pillow almost whiter than the pawn
she lay quite still and i looked around the room to see that all was as it should be
i could see that the professor had carried out in this room as in the other his purpose of using the garlic
the whole of the window sash esteemed with it and round lucy's neck over the silk handkerchief which van helsing made her keep on was a rough chaplet of the same odorous flowers
lucy was breathing somewhat sheet of ously and her face was at its worst for the open mouth showed the paper umw
her teeth in the dim uncertain light seemed longer and sharper than they had been in the morning
in particular by some trick of the light the canine teeth looked longer and sharper than the rest
i sat down beside her and presently she moved uneasily
at the same moment the became a sort of full flapping of buffering at the window
i went over to it softly and peeped out by the corner of the blind
there was a full moon light and i could see that the noise was made by a great bar which wheeled around doubtless attracted by the light although sodom and every now and again struck the window with its wings
when i came back to my seat i found that lucy had moved slightly and had torn away the garlic flowers from her throat
i replaced them as well as i could and sat watching her
presently she woke and i gave her food as van helsing had prescribed
she took but a little and that languidly
there did not seem to be with her now the unconscious struggle for life and strength that had hitherto so marked her illness
it struck me as curious that the moment she became conscious she pressed the garlic flowers close to her
it was certainly odd that whenever she got into that lethargic state with the stern proud breathing she put the flowers from her but that when she asked she clutched them close
there was no possibility of making any mistake about this for in the long hours that followed she had many spells of sleeping and waking and repeated both actions many times
at sixo'clock van helsing came to relieve me
arthur had then fallen into a dose and he mercifully let him sleep in
when he saw lucy's face i could hear the missing in draw of breath and he said to me in a sharp whisper
draw up the blind
i want light
then he bent down and with his face almost touching lucy's examined her carefully
he removed the flowers and lifted the silk handkerchief from her throat
as he did so he started back and i could hear his ejaculation me in both
as it was smothered in his throat
i bent over and looked too and as i noticed some queer chill same over me
the wounds on the throat had absolutely disappeared
for fully five minutes van helsing stood looking at her with his face at its stern est
then he turned to me and said calmly she is dying
it will not belong now
it will be much difference marine whether she does conscious or in her sleep
wake that poor boy and let him come and see the last
he trusts us and we have promised him
i went to the dining room and raked him
he was razed for a moment but when he saw the sunlight streaming on through the edges of the shutter she thought he was late and expressed his fear
i assured him that lucy was still asleep but told him as gently as i could that both van helsing and i feared that the end was gear
he covered his face with his hands and slid down on his knees by the sofa where he remained perhaps a minute with his head buried praying whilst his shoulders shook with grief
i took him by the hand and raised him up
time i said my dear old fellow summon all your fortitude
it will be best and easiest for her
when we came into lucy's room i could see that van helsing had with his usual forethought been putting matters straight and making everything look as pleasing as possible
he had even brushed lift's hair so that it lay on the pillow in its usual funny ripples
when we came into the room she opened her eyes and seeing him whispered softly arthur
oh my love i am so glad you have come
he was stooping to kiss her when van helsing motioned him back
no he whispered not yet
hold her hand it will comfort her more
so arthur took her hand and knelt beside her and she looked her nest with all the sort lines matching the angelic beauty of her eyes
then gradually her eyes closed and she sank to sleep
for a little bit her breast headed softly and her breath came and went like a tired child's
and then insensibly there came the strange change which i had noticed in the night
her breathing brewster giroux the mouth opened and the pale guns drawn back made the teeth look longer and sharper than ever
in a sort of sleep waking vague unconscious way she opened her eyes which were now dull and hard at once and said in a soft voluptuous voice such as i had never heard from her lips arthur
oh my love i am so glad you have come
kiss me
arthur bent eagerly over to kiss her but at that instant van helsing who like he had been startled by her voice swooped upon him and catching him by the neck with both bands dragged him back with a fury of strength which i never thought he could have possessed and actually hurled him almost across the room
not in your life
he said not for your living soul and here
and he stood between them like a lion at bay
arthur was so taken aback that he did not for a moment know what to doorway and before any impulse of violence could seize him he realized the place and the occasion and stood silent waiting
i kept my eyes fixed on lust as did van helsing and we saw a spasm aspera feel it like a shadow over her face
the sharp teeth clamped together
then her eyes closed and she breathed heavily
very shortly after she opened her eyes in all their softness and putting out her poor pale thing and took van helsing's great brown one drawing it close to her she kissed it
my true friends he said in a faint voice but with unreliable pathos my true friend and his
on guard him and give me peace
i swear it
he said solemnly kneeling beside her and holding up his hand as one who registers an oath
then he turned to arthur and said to him come my child take her hand in yours and kiss her in the forehead and only once
their eyes met instead of their lips and so they parted
lucy's eyes closed and van helsing who had been watching closely took arthur's arm and drew him away
and then lucy's breathing became ster to go us again and all at once it ceased
it is all over sale van helsing
she is dead
i took arthur by the arm and led him away to the drawing room where he sat down and covered his face with his hands sobbing in a way that nearly broke me down to see
i went back to the room and found van helsing looking at poor lucy and his face was sterner than ever
some change had come over her body
death had given back part of her beauty for her brow and cheeks has recovered some of their flowing lines
even the lips had lost their deadly pallor
it was as if the blood no longer needed for the working of the heart had gone to make the harshness of death as little rude as might be
we thought her dying whilst she slept and sleeping when she died
i stood beside van helsing and said ah well poor girl there is peace for her at last
it is the end
he turned time and said with grave solemnity not so alas
not so
it is only the beginning
when i asked him what he mean the only shook his head and answered we can do nothing as yet
wait and see
chapter dr
seward's diary cont
the funeral was arranged for the next succeeding day so that lucy and her mother might be buried together
i attended to all the ghastly formalities and the urbane undertaker proved that his staff was afflicted or blessed with something of his own obsequious sua city
even the woman who performed the last offices for the dead remarked home in a confidential brother professional way when she had come out from the death chamber she makes a very beautiful corpses of
it's quite a privilege to attend on her
it's got too much to say that she will do credit to our establishment
i noticed that van helsing never kept far away
this was possible from the disordered state of things in the household
there were no relatives at hand and as arthur had to be back the next day to attend at his father's funeral we were unable to notify anyone who should have been hidden
under the circumstances van helsing and i took it upon ourselves to examine papers etc.
he insisted upon looking over lucy's papers himself
i asked him why for i feared that he being a foreigner might not be quite aware of english legal requirements and so might in ignorance make some unnecessary trouble
he answered me i know i know
you forget that i am a lawyer as well as a doctor
buy this is not altogether for the law
you knew that when you avoided the coroner
i have more than him to avoid
there may be papers more such as this
as he spoke he took from his pocket book the memorandum which has been in lucy's breast and which she had torn in her sleep
when you find anything of the solicitor who is for the late mrs.
westenra seal all her papers and write him tonight
for me i watch here in the room and in miss lucy's old room all night and i myself search for what may be
it is not well that her very thoughts go into the hands of strangers
i went on with my part of the work and in another half hour had found the game and address of mrs.
westenra's solicitor and had written to him
all the poor lady's papers were in order
explicit directions regarding the place of burial were given
i had hardly sealed the letter when to my surprise van helsing walked into the room saying can i help you friend john
i am free and if i may my service is to you
have you got what you looked for
i asked
to which he replied i did not look for any specific thing
i only hoped to find and find i have all that there was only some letters and a few memoranda and a diary new begun
but i have them here and we shall for the present say nothing of them
i shall see that poor lad tomorrow evening and with his sanction i shall use some
when we had finished the working and he said to me and how friend john i think we may tones
we want sleep both you and i and rest to recuperate
tomorrow we shall have much to do but for the tonight there is no need of us
slac
before turning in we went to look at poor lucy
the undertaker had certainly done his work well for the room was turned into a small chapelle ardente
there was a wilderness of beautiful white flowers and death was made as little repulsive as might be
the end of the winding sheet was laid over the face
when the professor bent over and turned it gently back we both started at the beauty before us
that all wax candles showing a sufficient light to not fit well
all lucy's loveliness had come back to her in death and the hours that had passed instead of leaving traces of' decay's effacing fingers' mad but restored the beauty of life till positively i could not believe my eyes that i was looking at a corpse
the professor looked sternly grave
he had not loved her as i had and there was no need for years in his eyes
he said home remain till i return and left the room
he came back with a handful of wild garlic from the box waiting in the ball but which had not been opened and placed the flowers amongst the others on and around the bee
then he took from his neck inside his collar a little gold crucifix and placed it over the mouth
he restored the sheet to its place and we take away
i was undressing in my own room when with a pre monitor trap at the door he entered and at once began to speak
tomorrow i want you to bring me before night a set of postmortem knives
must we make an autopsy
i asked
yes and no
i want to operate but not what you think
let me tell you now but not a word to another
i want to cut off her head and take out her heart
ah
you a surgeon and so shocked
you whom i have seen with no tremble of hand or heart do operations of life and death that make the rest shudder
oh but i must not forget my dear friend john that you loved her and i have not forgotten it to risk that shall operate and you must not help
i would like to do it tonight but for arthur i must not
he will be free after his father's funeral tomorrow and he will want to see her to see it
then when she is coffin ed ready for the next day you and i shall come when all sleep
we shall unscrew the coffin old and shall do our operation and then replace all so that none know save we alone
but why do it at all
the girl is dead
why mutilate her poor body without need
and if there is no necessity for a postmortem and nothing to gain by it no good to her to us to science to human knowledge why do it
without such it is monstrous
for answer he put his hand on my shoulder and said with infinite tenderness friend john i pity your poor bleeding heart and i love you the more because it does so bleed
if i could i would take on myself the burden that you do bear
but there are things that you know not but that you shall know and bless me for knowing though they are not pleasant things
john my child you have been my friend how many years and yet did you ever know me to do any without good cause
on where i am but man but i believe in all i do
was it not for these causes that you send for me when the great trouble came
yes
were you not amazed may horrified when i would not let arthur kiss his love though she was dying and snatched him away by all my strength
yes
and yet you saw how she thanked me with her so beautiful dying eyes her voice too so weak and she kiss my rough old hand and bless me
yes
and did you not hear me swear promise to her that so she closed her eyes grateful
yes
well i have good reason now for all i want to do
you have for many years trust me
you have believe me weeks past when there be things so strange that you might have well doubt
believe me get a little friend john
if you trust me not then i must tell what i think and that is not perhaps well
and if i work as work i shall no matter trust or not rust without my friend trust in men work with heavy heart and feel oh so lonely when i want all help and courage that may be
he paused a moment and went on solemnly friend john there are strange and terrible days before us
let us not be two but one that so we work to a good end
will you not have faith in me
i took his hand and promised him
i held my door open as he went away and watched him go to his film and close the door
as i stood without moving i saw one of the maids pass silently along the passage she had her back to me so did not see me and go into the room where lucy lay
the sight touched me
devotion is so rare and we are so grateful to those who show it in asked to those we love
here was a poor girl putting aside the terrors which she naturally had of death to go watch alone by the bier of the mistress whom she loved so that the poor clay might not be lonely till laid toe teens orest
i must have slept long and soundly for it was broad daylight when van helsing asked me by coming into my room
he came over to my bedside and said you need not trouble about the knives
we shall not do it
why not
i asked
for his solemnity of the night before had greatly impressed me
because he said sternly it is too late or too early
see
here he held up the little golden crucifix
this was stolen in the night
how stolen issued in wonder since you have it now
because i get it back from the worthless wretch who stole it from the woman who robbed the dead and the living
her punishment will surely come but not through me
she knew not altogether what she did and thus in knowing she only stole
now we must wait
he went away on the word leaving me with a new mystery to think of a new puzzle to grapple with
the forenoon was a dreary time but at noon the solicitor came mr
marquand of whole manson's marquand lieder sale
he was very genial and very appreciative of what we had done and took off our hands all cares as to details
during lunch be told us that mfs
westenra had for some time expected sudden death from her heart and had put her affairs in absolute order
he informed us that with the exception of a certain entailed property of lucy's father which now in default of direct issue went back to a distant branch of the family the whole estate real and personal was left absolutely to arthur holmwood
when he had told us so much he went on frankly we did our best to prevent such a testamentary disposition and pointed out certain contingencies that might leave her daughter either penniless or not so free as she should be to act regarding a matrimonial alliance
indeed we pressed the matter so far that we almost came into collision for she asked us if we were or were not prepared to carry out her wishes
of course we had them to alternative but to accept
we were right in principle and ninety nine times out of a hundred we should have proved by the logic of events the accuracy of our judgment
frankly however i must admit that in this case any other form of disposition would have rendered impossible the carrying out of her wishes
for by her press ceasing her daughter the latter would have come into possession of the property and even had she only survived her mother by five minutes her property would in case there were now i'll and a will was a practical impossibility in such a case have been treated at her decease as under intestacy
in which case lord godalming though so dear a friend would have had no claim in the world
and the inheritors being remote would not be likely to abandon their just rights for sentimental reasons regarding an entire stranger
i assure you my dear sirs i am rejoiced at the result perfectly rejoiced
he was a good fellow but his rejoicing at the one little part in which he was officially interested or so great a tragedy was an object lesson in the limitations of sympathetic understanding
he did not remain long but said he would look in later in the day and see lots godalming
his coming however had been a very win comfort to us since it assured us that we should not have to dread hostile criticism as to any of our acts
arthur was expected at fiveo'clock so a little before that time we visited the death chamber
it was so in very truth for now both mother and daughter latin it
the undertaker true to his craft had made the best display he could of his goods and there was a mortuary air about the place that lowered our spirits at once
van helsing ordered the former arrangement to be adhered to explaining that as lord godalming was coming very soon it would be less harrowing to his feelings to see all that was left of his fiancee quite alone
the undertaker seemed shocked at his own stupidity and exerted himself to restore things to the condition in which we left them the night before so that when arthur c. and such shocks to his feelings as we could avoid were saved
poor fellow
he looked desperately sad and broken
even his stalwart manhood seemed to have shrunk somewhat under the strain of his much tried emotions
he had i knew been very genuinely and devotedly attached to his father and to lose him and at such a time was a bitter blow to him
with me he was warm as ever and to van helsing he was sweetly courteous
but i could not help seeing that there was some constraint with him
the professor noticed it too and motioned me to bring him upstairs
i did so and left him at the door of the room as i felt he would like to be quite alone with her but he took my arm and led me in saying huskily you loved her too old fellow
she told me all about it and there was no friend had a closer place in her heart than you
idon't know how to thank you for all you have done for her
ican't think yet
here he suddenly broke down and threw his arms round my shoulders and laid his head on my breast crying on jack
jack
what shall i do
the whole of life seems gone from me all at once and there is nothing in the wide world for me to live for
i comforted him as well as i could
in such cases men do not need much expression
a grip of the hand the tightening of an arm over the shoulder as of in unison are expressions of sympathy dear to a man's heart
i stood still and silent hill his sons died away and then i said softly to him come and look at her
together we moved over to the bed and i lifted the lawn from her face
god
how beautiful she was
every hour seemed to be enhancing her loveliness
it frightened and amazed me somewhat
and as for arthur he fell to trembling and finally was shaken with doubt as with an avid
a blast after a long pause he said to me in a faint whisper jack is she really dead
i assured him sadly that it was so and went on to suggest for i felt that such a horrible doubt should not have life for a moment longer than i could help that it often happened that after death faces become softened and even resolved into their youthful beauty that this was especially so when death had been preceded by any acute or prolonged suffering
i seemed to quite do away with any doubt and after kneeling beside the couch for awhile and looking at her lovingly and long he turned aside
i told him that that must be goodbye as the coffin had to be prepared so he went back and took her dead hand in his and kissed it and bent over and kissed her forehead
he came away fondly looking back over his should weather as he came
i left him in the drawing room and told van helsing that he had said goodbye do the latter went to the kitchen to tell the undertaker's men to proceed with the preparations and to screw up the coffin
when he came out of the room again i told him of arthur's question and he replied i am not surprised
just now i doubted for a moment myself
we all dined together and i could see that poor art was trying to make the best of things
van helsing had been silent all dinner time but when we had lit our cigars he said lord
but arthur interrupted him
no no not that for god's sake
not yet at any rate
forgive me sur
i did not mean to speak offensively
it is only because my loss is so recent
the professor answered very sweetly i only used that name because i was in doubt
i just not call you'm r
' and i have grown to love you yes my dear boy to love you as arthur
arthur held out his hand and took the old man's warmly
call me what you will he said
i hope i may always have the title of a friend
and let me say that i what a loss for words to thank you for your goodness to my poor dear
he paused a moment and went on i know that she understood your goodness even better than i do
and if i was rude or in any way wanting at that time you acted so you remember the professor nodded you must forgive me
he answered with a grave kindness i know it was hard for you to quite trust her mentor to trust such violence needs to understand and i take it that you do not that you can not trust me now for you do not yet understand
and there may be more times when i shall want you to trust when you can not and may not and must not yet understand
but the time will come when your trust shall be whole and complete in me and when you shall understand as though the sunlight himself shone through
then you shall bless me from first to last for your own sake and for the sake of others and for her dear wake to whom i swore to protect
and indeed indeed sir said arthur warmly
i shall in all ways trust you
i know and believe you have a very noble heart and you are jack's friend and you were here
you shall do what you like
the professor cleared his throat a couple of times as though about to speak and finally said may i ask you something now
certainly
you know that mrs.
westenra left you all her property
no poor dear
i never thought of it
and as it is all yours you have a right to deal with it as you will
i want you to give me permission to read all miss lucy's papers and letters
believe me it is no idle curiosity
i have a motive of which be sure she would have approved
i have them all here
i took them before we knew that all was your ask that no strange hand might touch them no stranger us look through words into her soul
i shall keep them if i may
even you may not see them yet but i shall keep them safe
no word shall be lost and in the good time i shall give them back to you
it is a hard thing that i ask but you will do it will you not for lucy's sake
arthur spoke out heartily like his old self dr
van helsing you may do what you will
i feel that in saying this i am doing what my dear one would have approved
i shall not trouble you with questions till the time comes
the old professor stood up as he said solemnly and you are right
there will be pain for us all but it will not be all pain nor will this pain be the last
we and you too you most of all dear boy will have to pass through the bitter water before we reach the sweet
but we must be brave of heart and unselfish and do our duty and all will be well
i slept on a sofa in arthur's room that night
van helsing did not go to bed at all
he went to and fro as if patrol ing the house and was never out of sight of the room where lucy lay in her coffin strewn with the wild garlic flowers which went through the odour of lily and to sea heavy overpowering smell into the night
mina harper's journal september
in the train to exeter
jonathan sleeping
it seems only yesterday that the last entry was made and yet how much between them in whitby and all the world before me jonathan away and no news of him and now married to jonathan jonathan a solicitor a partner rich master of his business mr
hawkins dead and buried and jonathan with another attack that may harm him
someday he may ask me about it
down it all goes
i am rusty in my shorthand see what unexpected prosperity does for us so it may be as well to freshen it up again with an exercise anyhow
the service was very simple and very solemn
there were only ourselves and the servants there one or two old friends of his from exeter his london agent and a gentleman representing sir john paxton the president of the incorporated law society
jonathan and i stood hand in hand and we felt that our best and dearest friend was gone from us
we came back to town quietly taking a bus to hyde park corner
jonathan thought it would interest me to go into the row for awhile so we sat down
but there were very few people there and it was sad looking and desolate to see so many empty chairs
it made us think of the empty chair at home
so we got up and walked down piccadilly
jonathan was holding me by the arm the way he used to in the old days before i went to school
i felt it very improper for youcan't room for some years teaching etiquette and decorum to other girls without the pedantry of it biting into yourself a bit
but it was jonathan and he was my husband and we didn't know anybody who saw us and we didn't care if they did soon we walked
i was looking at a very beautiful girl in a big cartwheel hat sitting in a victoria our side guiliano's when i felt jonathan clutch my arm so fight that he hurt me and he said under his breath my god
i am always anxious about jonathan for i fear that some nervous but may upset him again
so i turned to him quickly and asked him what it was that disturbed him
he was very pale and his eyes seemed bulging out as half in terror and half in amazement he gazed at a tall thin man with a few my nose and black moustache and pointed beard who was also observing the pretty girl
he was looking at her so hard that he did not see either of us and so i had a good view of him
his face was not a good face
it was hard and cruel and sensual and big white teeth that looked all the whiter because his lips were sorts were pointed like an animal's
jonathan kept staring at him till i was afraid he would notice
i feared he might take i till he looked so fierce and nasty
i asked jonathan why he was disturbed and he answered evidently thinking that i knew as much about it as he did do you see about us
no fear i said
idin't know him who is it
his answer seemed to shock and thrill me for it was said as if he did not know that it was menina to whom he was speaking
it is the man himself
the poor dear was evidently terrified at something very greatly terrified
i do believe that if he had not had me to lean on and to support him he would have sunk down
he kept staring
a man came out of the shop with a small parcel and gave it to the lady who then drove off
the dark man kept his eyes fixed on her and when the carriage moved up piccadilly he followed in the same direction and hailed a hanson
jonathan kept looking after him and said as it to himself i believe it is the count but he has grown young
my god of this be so
oh my god
my god
if only i knew
if only i knew
he was distressing himself so much that i feared to keep his mind on the subject by asking him any questions so i remained silent
i drew away quietly and he holding my arm came easily
we walked a little further and then went in and sat for awhile in the green park
it was a hot day for autumn and there was a comfortable seat in a shady place
after a few minutes' staring at nothing jonathan's eyes closed and he went quickly into a sleep with his head on my shoulder
i thought it was the best thing for him so did not disturb him
in about twenty minutes he woke up and said to me quite cheerfully why mina have i been asleep
oh so forgive me for being so rude
come and we'll have a cup of tea somewhere
he had evidently forgotten all about the dark stranger as in his illness he had forgotten all that this episode had reminded him of
idon't like this lapsing into forgetfulness
it may make or continue some injury to the brain
i must not ask him for fear i shall do more harm than good but i must somehow learn the facts of his journey abroad
the time is come i fear when i must open the parcel and know what is written
oh jonathan you will i know forgive me if i go wrong but it is for your own fear sale
later
a sad homecoming in every way the house empty of the dead soul who was so good to us
jonathan still pale and dizzy under a slight relapse of his malady and now a telegram from van helsing whoever he may be
you will be grieved to hear that mrs.
westenra died five days ago and that lucy died the day before yesterday
they were both buried today
oh what a wealth of sorrow in a few words
poor mrs.
westenra
poor lucy
gone gone never to return to us
and poor poor arthur to have lost such a sweetness out of his life
god help us all to hear our troubles
dr
seward's diary cont
september
it is all over
arthur has gone back to ring and has taken quincey morris with him
what a fine fellow is quincey
i believe in my heart of hearts that he suffered as much about lucy's death as any of us but before himself through it like a moral viking
if america can go on breeding men like that she will be a power in the world indeed
van helsing is lying down having a rest preparatory to his journey
he goes to amsterdam tonight but says he returns tomorrow night that he only wants to make some arrangements which can only be made personally
he is to stop with me then if he can
he says he has work to do in london which may take him some time
poor old fellow
i fear that the strain of the past week has broken down even his iron strength
all the time of the burial he was i could see putting some terrible restraint on himself
when it was all over we were standing beside arthur who poor fellow was speaking of his part in the operation where his blood had been transfused to his lucy's veins
i could see van helsing's face grow white and purple by turns
arthur was saying that he felt since then as if they two had been really married and that she was his wife in the sight of god
none of us said a word of the other operations and none of us ever shall
arthur and quincey went away together to the station and van helsing and i came on here
the moment we were alone in the carriage he gave way to a regular fit of hysterics
he has denied time since that it was hysterics and insisted that it was only his sense of humor asserting itself under very terrible conditions
he laughed till he cried and i had to draw down the blinds lest anyone should see us and misjudge
and then he cried till he laughed again and laughed and cried together just as a woman does
i tried to be stern with him as one is to a woman under the circumstances but it had no effect
men and women are so different in manifest ations of nervous strength or weakness
then when his face grew grave and stern again i asked him why his mirth and why at such a home
his reply was in a way characteristic of him for it was logical and forceful and mysterious
he said at youdon''t comprehend friend john
do not think that i am not sad though i laugh
see i have cried even when the laugh did choke me
but no more think that i small sorry when i cry for the laugh become just the same
keep it always with you that laughter who knock at your door and say' may i come in
' is not true laughter
no
he is doing and become when and how he like
he ask no person he choose not one of suitability
he say' i am here
' behold i j example i grieve my heart out for that so sweet young girl
i give my blood for her though i am old and worn
i give my time my skill my sleep
i let my other sufferers want that she may have all
and yet i can laugh at her very grave laugh when the clay from the slave of the sexton drop upon her coffin and say' thus this
' to my heart till it send back the blood from my cheek
my heart bleed for that poor boy that dear boy so of the age of mine own boy had i been so blessed that he live and with his hair and eyes the same
there you know now why i love him so
and yet when he say things that touch my husband heart to the quick and make my father heart yearn to him as to no other man not even you friend john for we are more level in experiences than father and sonnet even at such a moment king laugh he come to me and shout and fellow in my ear' here i am
here i am
' till the blood come dance back and bring some of the sunshine that he carry with him to my cheek
oh friend john it is a strange world a sad world a world full ibm iseries and does and troubles
and yet when king laugh come he make them all dance to the time he play
bleeding hearts and dry bones of the churchyard and tests that burn as they fall all dance together to the music that he make with that smokeless mouth of him
and believe me friend john that he is good to come and kind
at wemen and women are like ropes drawn tight with strain that pull us different ways
then tears come and like the rain on the ropes they brace is up until perhaps the strain become too great and we break
but king laugh become like the sunshine and he ease off the strain again and we bear to go on with our labor what it may be
i did not like to sound him by pretending not to see his idea but as i did not yet understand the cause of his laughter i asked him
as he answered me his face grew stern and he said in quite a different tone on it was the grim irony of it all this so lovely lady garlanded with flowers that looked so fair as life till one by one we wondered if she were truly dead she laid in that's prime marble house in that lonely churchyard where fest so many of heroin laid there with the mother who loved her and whom she loved and that sacred bell going' roll
toll
toll
' so sad and slow and those holy men with the white garments of the angel pretending to read books and yet all the time their eyes never on the page and all of us with the bowed head
and all for what
she is dead so
is it not
well for the life of me professor i said ican't see anything to laugh at in all that
why your expression makes it a harder puzzle than before
but even if the burial service was comic what about poor art and his trouble
why his heart was simply breaking
just so
said he not that the transfusion of his blood to her veins had made her truly his bride
yes and it was a sweet and comforting idea for him
quotes l
but there was a difficulty friend john
if so that then what about the others
ho ho
then this so sweet maid is a poly and rust and me with my poor wife dead time but a life by church's law though now it's all gone even i who am faithful husband to this now now in san big am ist
idon't see where the joke comes in there either
i said and i did not feel particularly pleased with him for saying such things
he laid his hand on my arm and said friend john forgive me if i pain
i showed not my feeling to others when it would sound but only to you my old friend whom i can trust
if you could have looked into my heart then when i want to laugh if you could have done so when the laugh arrived if you could do so now when king laugh have lack up his crown and all that is to him for me go far far away from me and for a long long time maybe you would perhaps pity me the most of all
i was touched by the tenderness of his tone and asked why
because i know
and now we are all scattered and for manga long day loneliness will sit over our roots with brooding wings
lucy lies in the tomb of her kind lordly death house in a lonely churchyard away from teeming london where the air is fresh and the sun rises over hampstead hill and where wild flowers grow or their own accord
so i can finish this diary and god only knows if i shall ever begin another
if i do or if i even open this again it will be to deal with different people and different themes for here at the end where the romance of my life is holders i go back to take up the thread of my life work is a yearly and without hope finis
the westminster gazette september a hampstead mystery the neighborhood of hampstead is just at present exercised with a series of events which seem to run on lines parallel to those of what was known to the writers of headlines as the kensington horror of the stabbing woman of the woman in black
during the past two or three days several cases have occurred of young children straying from home or neglecting to return from their playing on the heath
in all these cases the children were too young to give any properly intelligible account of themselves but the consensus of their excuses is that they had been with a blood eg lady
it has always been late in the evening when they have been missed and on two occasions the children have not been found until early in the following morning
it is generally supposed in the neighborhood that as the first child missed have as his reason for being a way that a blooded lady had asked him to come for a walk the others had picked up the phrase and used it as occasion served
this is the more natural as the favourite game of the little ones at present is my ring each others say by wiles
a correspondent writes us that go see some of the tiny tots pretending to be the no older lady is supremely funny
some of our caricaturists might he says take a lesson in the irony of grotesque by comparing the reality and the picture
it is only in accordance with general principles of human nature that the blood eg lady should be the popular role at these alfresco performances
our correspondent naively says that even ellen terry could not be so winning it attractive as some of these grubby faced little children pretend and even imagine themselves to be
there is however possibly a serious side to the question for some of the children indeed all who have been missed at might have been slightly torn or wounded in the throat
the wounds seem such as might be made by a gator a small dog and although if not much importance individually would tend to show that whatever animal inflicts them has a system or method of its own
the police of the division have been instructed to keep a sharp lookout for straying children especially when very young in and around hampstead heath and for any stray dog which may be about
the westminster gazette september extra special the hampstead horror another child injured the blooded lady we have just received intelligence that another child missed last night was only discovered late in the morning under a curse bush at the shooter's hillside of hampstead heath which is perhaps less frequented than the other parts
it has the same to my wound in the throat as has been noticed in other cases
it was terribly weak and looked quite emaciated
it too when partially restored had the common story to tell of being lured away by the blooded lady
chapter mina harker's journal september
jonathan is better after a bad night
i am so glad that he has plenty of work to do for that keeps his mind off the terrible things and oh i am rejoiced that he is not now weighed down with the responsibility of his new position
i knew he would be true to himself and now how proud i am to see my jonathan rising to the height of his advancement and keeping pace in all ways with the duties that come upon him
he will be away all day till late for he said he could not lunch at home
my household work is done so i shall take his foreign journal and lock myself up in my room and read it
september
ihavn't the heart to write last night that terrible record of jonathan's upset me so
poor dear
how he must have suffered whether it be true or only imagination
i wonder if there is any truth in it at all
did he get his brain fever and then write all those terrible things or had become cause for it all
i suppose i shall never know for i dare not open the subject to him
and yet that man we saw yesterday
he seemed quite certain of him poor fellow
i suppose it was the funeral upset him and sent his mind back on some train of thought
he believes it all himself
i remember how on our wedding day he said unless some solemn duty come upon me to go back to the bitter hours asleep or awaken a corsage
there seems to be through it all come thread of continuity
that fearful count was coming to london
if it should be and he came to london with its teeming millions
there may be a solemn duty and if it come we must not shrink from it
i shall be prepared
i shall get my typewriter this very hour and begin transcribing
then we shall be ready for other eyes if required
and if it be wanted then perhaps if i am ready poor jonathan may not be upset for i can speak for him and never let him be troubled or worried with it at all
if ever jonathan quite gets over the nervousness ye may want to tell me of it all and i can ask him questions and find out things and see how i may comfort him
letter van helsing times
harker september confidence dear madam i pray you to pardon my writing in that i am so far friend as that i went to you sadness of miss lucy westenra's death

i implore your pardon madam
i have read your letters to poor lucy and know how good you are and how your husband suffer
so i pray you if it may be enlighten him not least it may harm
again your pardon and forgive me
van helsing telegram mrs.
marker to van helsing september
come today by quarter past ten train if you can catch it
can see you anytime you call
wilhelmina marker mina harker's journal september
i can not help feeling terribly excited as the time draws near for the visitor dr
van helsing for sims how i expect that it will throw some light upon jonathan's sad experience and as he attended poor dear lucy in her last illness he can tell me all about her
that is the reason of his coming
it is concerning lucy and her sleep walking and not about jonathan
then i shall never know the real truth now
how silly i am
that awful journal get ahold of my imagination and hinges everything with something of its own colour
of course it is about lucy
that habit came back to the poor dear and that awful night on the cliff must have made her ill
i had almost forgotten in my own affairs how ill she was afterwards
she must have told him of her sleep walking adventure on the cliff and that i knew all about it and now he wants me to tell him what i know so that he may understand
i hope i did right in not saying anything of it to mrs.
westenra
i should never forgive myself if any act of mine were it even a negative one brought harmon poor dear lucy
i hope to kde
van helsing will not blame me
i have had so much trouble and anxiety of late that i feel i can not hear more just at present
i suppose a cry does is all good at times clears the air as other rain dogs
perhaps it was reading the journal yesterday that upset me and then jonathan went away this morning to stay away from me a whole day and might the first time we have been parted since our marriage
i do hope the dear fellow will take care of himself and that nothing will occur to upset him
it is twoo'clock and the doctor will be here soon now
i shall say nothing of jonathan's journal unless he asks me
i am so glad i have typewritten out my own journal so that in case he asks about lucy icann and it to him
it will save must questioning
later
he has come and none
oh what a strange meeting and how it all makes my head whirl round
i feel like one in a dream
can it be all possible or even a part of it
if i had not read jonathan's journal first i should never have a scepter even a possibility
poor poor dear jonathan
how he must have suffered
please the good for all this may not upset him again
i shall try to save him from it
but it maybe even a consolation and a help to him terrible though it be and awful in its consequences to know for certain that his eyes and ears and brain did not deceive him and that it is all true
it may be that it is the doubt which haunts him that when the doubt is removed no matter which waking or dreaming may prove the truth he will be more satisfied and better able to bear the shock
dr
van helsing must be a good man as well as a clever in eight is arthur's friend and dr
seward's and if they brought him all the way from holland to look after lucy
i feel from having seen him that he is good and kind and of a noble nature
when he comes tomorrow i shall ask him about jonathan
and then please god all this sorrow and anxiety may lead to a good end
i used to think i would like to practice interviewing
jonathan's friend on the exeter news told him that memory is everything in such work that you must be able to put down exactly almost every word spoken even if you had to define some of it afterwards
here was a rare interview
i shall try to record it verbatim
it was half past twoo'clock when the knock came
i took my courage a deux mains and waited
in a few minutes mary opened the door and announced dr
van helsing
i rose and bowed and he came towards me a man of medium weight strongly built with his shoulders setback over a broad deep chest and a neck well balanced on the trunk as the head is on the neck
the poise of the head strikes me at once as indicative of thought and power
the head is noble well sized broad and large behind the ears
the face clean shaven shows a hard square china large resolute mobile mouth a good sized nose rather straight cut with quick sensitive nostrils that seem to broaden as the big busty brows come down and the mouth tightens
the forehead is broad and fine rising at first almost straight and then sloping back above two bumps or ridges wide apart such a forehead that the reddish hair can not possibly tumble over it but falls naturally back and to the sides
big dark blue eyes are set widely apart and are quick and gender or stern with the man's moods
he said to memes
marker is it not
i bowed assent
that was his china murray
again law center
it is mina murray that i came to see that was friend of that poor dear child lucy westenra
madam mina it is on account of the dead that i come
sir i said you could have no better claim on me than that you were a friend and helped of lucy westenra
and i held out my hand
he took it and said tenderly on madam mina i know that the friend of that poor little girl must be good but i had yet to learn
he finished his speech with a courtly now
i asked him what it was that he wanted to see me about some at once began
i have read your letters to miss lucy
forgive me but i had to begin to inquire somewhere and there was gone to ask
i know that you were with her at whitby
she sometimes kept a diary you need not look surprised madam mina
it was begun after you had left and was an imitation of you and in that diary she travesty onference certain things to a sleep walking in which she puts down that you saved her
in great perplexity then i come to you and ask you out of your so much kindness to tell me all of it that you can remember
i can tell you i think dr
van helsing all about it
ah then you have good memory for facts for details
it is not always so with young ladies
no doctor but i wrote it all down at the time
i can show it to you if you like
oh madam mihai we'll be grateful
you will come much favour
i could not resist the temptation of mystifying him a bit i suppose it is some taste of the original apple that remains still in our mouths so i handed him the shorthand diary
he took it with a grateful bow and said may i read it
if you wish i answered as demurely as i could
he opened it and for an instant his face fell
then he stood up and bowed
oh you so clever woman
he said
i knew long that mr.
jonathan was a man of much thankfulness but are his wife have all the good things
and will you not so much honour me and so help me as to read it for me
alas
i know not the shorthand
by this time my little joke was over and i was almost ashamed
so i took the typewritten copy from my work basket and handed it to him
forgive me i said
i could not help it but i had been thinking that it was of fear lucy that you wished to ask and so that you might not have time to wait not on my account but because i know your time must be previous i have written it out on the typewriter for you
he took it and his eyes glistened
you are so good he said
and may i read it now
i may want to ask you some things when i have read
by all means i said read it over whilst i order punch and then you can ask me questions whilst we eat
he bowed and settled himself in a chair with his back to the light and became so absorbed in the papers whilst i went to see after lunch chiefly in order that he might not be disturbed
when i came back i found him walking hurriedly up and down the room his face all ablaze with excitement
he rushed up to me and took me by both hands
oh madam min she said how can i say what i owe to you
this paper is as sunshine
it opens the gate home
i am dazed i am dazzled with so much light and yet clouds roll in behind the light every time
but that you do not can not comprehend
oh but i am grateful to you you so clever woman
madame he said this very solemnly if ever abraham van helsing can do anything for you or yours i trust you will let me know
it will be pleasure and delight if i may serve you as a friend as a friend but all i have ever learned all i can ever do shall be for you and those you love
there are darkness es in life and there are lights
you are one of the lights
you will have a happy life and a good life and your husband will be blessed in you
but doctor you praise me too much and you do not know me
not know you is to an old and who have studied all my life men and women i who have made my specialty the brain and all that belongs to him and all that follow from him
and i have read your diary that you have so goodly written for me and which breathed out truth in every line
i who have read your so sweet letter to poor lucy of your marriage and your trust not know you
oh made mm in a good women tell all their lives and by day and by hour and by minute such things that angels can read
and we men who wish to know have in us something of angels' eyes
your husband is noble nature and you are noble too for you trust and trust can not be where there is mean nature
and your husband tell me of him
is he quite well
us all that fever home and is he strong and hearty
usa where an opening to ask him about jonathan so i said he was almost recovered but he has been greatly upset by mr
hawkins death
he interrupted oh yes
i know
i know
i have read your last two letters
i went on i suppose this upset him for when we were in town on thursday last he had a sort of stock
a shock and after brain fever so soon
that is not good
what kind of shock was it
he thought he saw someone who recalled something terrible something which led to his brain fever
and here the whole thing seemed to overwhelm me in a rush
the pity for jonathan the horror which he experienced the whole fearful mystery of his diary and the fear that has been brooding over me ever since all came in a tumult
i suppose i was hysterical for i threw myself on my knees and held up my hands to him and implored him to make my husband well again
he took my hands and raised me up and made me sit on the sofa and sat by me
he held my hand in his she said to me within such infinite sweetness my life is a barren and lonely one and so full of work that i have not had much time for friendships but since i have been summoned to hereby my friend john edward i have known so many good people and seen such nobility that i feel more than ever and it has grown with my advancing years the loneliness of my life
believe me then that i come here full of respect for you and you have given me hope hope not in what i am seeking of but that there are good women still left to make life happy good women whose lives and whose truths may make good lesson for the children that are to be
i am glad glad thati'ma there be of some use to you
for if your husband suffer he suffer within the range of my study and experience
i promise you that i will gladly do all for him that i can all to make his life strong and manly and your life a happy one
now you must eat
you are overwrought and perhaps over anxious
husband jonathan would not like to see you so pale and what he mike got where he love is not to his good
therefore for his sake you must eat and while
you have told me about lucy and so now we shall not speak of it lest it distress
i shall stay in exeter tonight for i want to think much over what you have told me and when i have thought i will ask you questions if i may
and then too you will tell me of husband jonathan's trouble so far as you can but not yet
you just eat now afterwards you shall tell me all
after lunch when we went back to the drawing room he said to me and now tell me all about him
when it came to speaking to this great learned man i began to fear that he would think he was so cool and jonathan a madman that journal is all so strange and i hesitated to go on
but he was so sweet and kind and he had promised to help and i trusted him so i said dr
van helsing what i have to tell you is so queer that you must not laugh at me or at my husband
i have been since yesterday in a sort of refer of doubt
you must be kind come and not think md foolish that i have even half believed some very strange things
here assured me by his manner as well as his words when he said on my dear if you only know how strange is the matter regarding which i am here it is you who would laugh
i have learned not to think little of anyone's belief no matter how strange it may be
i have tried to keep an open mind and it is not the ordinary things of life that could close it but the strange things the extraordinary things the things that make one doubt if they be mad prs and
thank you thank you a thousand times
you have taken a weight off my mind
if you will let me i shall give you a paper to read
it is long but i have typewritten it out
it will tell you my trouble and jonathan's
it is the copy of his journal when a broad and all that happened
i dare not say anything of it
you will read for yourself and judge
and then when i see you perhaps you will be very kind and tell me what you think
i promise he said as i gave him the papers
i shall in the morning as soon as i can come to see you and your husband if i may
jonathan will be here at half past eleven and you must come to lunch with us and see him then
you could catch the quick train which will leave you atpase ington before eight
he was surprised at my knowledge of the trains offhand but he does not know that i have made up all the grains to and from exeter so that i may help jonathan in case he is in a hurry
so he took the papers with him and went away and is it here thinking thinking idon't know what
letter by hans van helsing tongs

jonathan harker's journal september
i thought never to write in this diary again but the time has come
when i got home last night nina had supper ready and when we had supper she told me of van helsing's visit and other having given him the two diaries copied out and of how anxious she has been about me
she showed me in the doctor's letter that all i wrote down was true
it seems to have made and a man of me
it was the doubt as to the reality of the whole thing that knocked me over
i felt in potent and in the dark and distrustful
but now that i know i am not afraid even if the count
he has succeeded after all then in his design in getting to london and it was heisse
he has got younger and how
van helsing is the man to unmask him and hunt him out if he is anything like what mina days
we sat late and talked it over
mina is dressing and i shall call at the hotel in a few minutes and bring him over
he was i think surprised to see me
when i came into the room where he was and introduced myself he took me by the shoulder and turned my face round to the light and said after a sharp scrutiny but madam mina told me you were ill that you had had a shock
it was so funny to hear my wife called' madam mins' by this kind of strong faced old man
i smiled and said i was ill i have had a shock but you have cured me already
anchor
by your letter domina last night
i was in doubt and then everything took a hue of unreality and i did not know what to trust even the evidence of my own senses
not knowing what to trust i did not know what to do and so had only to keep on working in what had hitherto been the groove of my life
the groove ceased to avail me and i mistrusted myself
doctor youdon''t know what it is to doubt everything even yourself
no youdon't youcouldn't with eyebrows like yours
he seemed pleased and laughed as he said so
you are a physio gnomish
i learn more here with each hour
i am with so much pleasure coming to you to breakfast and its if you will pardon praise from an old man but you are blessed in your site
i would listen to him go on praising mins for a day so i simply nodded and stood silent
she is one of god's women fashioned by his own hand to show us men and other women that there is a heaven where we can enter and that its light can be here on earth
so true so sweet so noble so little and hoist and that let me tell you is much in this area is celtic am and selfish
and you sir
i have read all the letters to poor miss lucy and some of them speak of you so i know you since some days from the knowing of others but i have seen your true self since last night
you will give me your hand will you not
and let us befriends for all our lives
we shook hands and he was so earnest and so kind that it made me quite choon
and now he said mahi ask you for some more help
i have a great task to do and at the beginning it is to know
you can help me here
can you tell me what went before your going to transylvania
later on i may ask more help and of a different kind but at first this will do
look here sir i said does what you have to do concern the count
it does he said solemnly
then i am with you heart and soul
as you go by the train you will not have time to read them but i shall get the bundle of papers
you can take them with you and read them in the train
after breakfast i saw him to the station
when we were part in the said perhaps you will come to town if i send for you and take madam minato o
we shall both come when you will i said
i had got him the morning papers and the london papers of the previous night and while we were talking at the carriage window waiting for the train to start he was turning them over
his eyes suddenly seemed to catch something in one of them the westminster gazette i knew it by the colour and he grew quite white
he read something intently groaning to himself me in both
me in both
so soon
so soon
i do not think he remembered me at the moment
just then the whistle blew and the train moved off
this recalled him to himself and he leaned out of the window and waved his hand calling out love to madam mins
i shall write so soon as ever i can
dr
seward's diary september
truly there is no such thing as finality
not a week since i said finis and yet here i am starting fresh again or rather going on with the record
until this afternoon i had no cause to think of what is done
renfield had become hi all intents as safe as he ever was
he was already well ahead with his fly business and he had just started in the spider line also so he had not been of any trouble home
i had a letter from arthur written on sunday and gromit i gather that he is gearing up wonderfully well
quincey morris is with him and that is much of a help for he himself is a bubbling well of good spirits
quincey wrote me alone too and from him i hear that arthur is beginning to recover something of his old buoyancy so as to them all my mind is a great
as for myself i was settling down to my work with the enthusiasm which i used to have for it so that i might fairly have said that the wound which poor lucy left on me was becoming sic are used
everything is however now reopened and what is to be the end god only knows
i have an idea that van helsing think she knows too but he will only let out enough at a time to whet curiosity
he went to exeter yesterday and stayed there all night
today he came back and almost bounded into the room at about half past fiveo'clock and thrust last night's westminster gazette onto my hand
what do you think of that
he asked as he stood back and folded his arms
i looked over the paper for i really did not know what he meant but he took it from me and pointed out a paragraph about children being devoted away at hampstead
it did not convey much time until i reached a passage where it described small puncture wounds on their throats
an idea struck me and i looked up
well
he said
it is like poor lucy's
and what do you make of it
simply that there is some cause of common
whatever it was that injured her has injured them
i did not quite understand his answer
that is true indirectly but not directly
how do you mean professor
i asked
i was a little inclined to take his seriousness lightly for after all four days of rest and freedom from burning harrowing anxiety does help to restore one's spirits but when i saw his face it sobered me
never even in the midst of our despair about poor lucy had he looked more stern
tell me
i said
i can hazard no opinion
i do not know what to think and i have no data on which to found a conjecture
do you mean to tell me friend john that you have no suspicion as to what poor lucy died of not after all the hints given not only by events but by me
of nervous prostration following a great loss or waste of blood
and how was the blood lost or wasted
i shook my head
he stepped over and sat down beside me and went on you are a clever man friend john
you read on wall and your works bold but you are too prejudiced
you do not let your eyes seen or your ears hear and that which is outside your daily life is not of account to you
do you not think that there are things which you can not understand and yet which are that some people see things that others can not
but there are things old and new which must not be contemplated by men's eyes because they know or think they know some things which other men have told them
at it is the fault of our science that it wants to explain all and if it explain not then it says there is nothing to explain
but yet we see around us everyday the growth of new beliefs which think themselves new and which are yet but the old which pretend to be young like the fine ladies at the opera
i suppose now you do not believe incorporeal transference
no
nor in materialization
no
nor in astral bodies
no
nor in the red wing of thought
no
nor in hypnotism
yes i said
charcot has proved that pretty well
he smiled as he went on then you are satisfied as to it
yes
and of course then you understand how it act and can follow the kind of the great charcot alas that he is no more into the very soul of the patient that he influence
no
then friend john ami to take it that you simply accept fact and are satisfied to let from premise to conclusion be a blank
no
then tell me for i am a student of the brain how you accept hypnotism and reject the thought reading
let me tell you my friend that there are things done today in electrical science which would have been deemed unholy by the very man who discovered electricity who would themselves not so long before been burned as wizards
there are always mysteries in life
why was it that methuselah lived nine hundred years and'll spare' one hundred and sixty nine and yet that poor lucy with four men's blood in her poor veins could not live even one day
for had she live one more day we could save her
do you know all the mystery of life and death
do you know the altogether of comparative anatomy and can say wherefore the qualities of brutes are in some men and not in others
can you tell me why when other spiders die small and so i'm that one great spider lived for centuries in the tower of the old spanish church and grew and grew fill in descending he could drink the kkk of all the church lamps
can you tell me why in the pampas a hand elsewhere there are bats that come out at night and open the veins of cattle and horses and suck dry their veins to win some islands of the western seas there are bats which hang on the trees all day and those who have seen describe as like giant but so goods and that when the sailors sleep on the deck because that it is not do it down on them and then and then in the morning are found dead men white as ever miss lucy was
good god professor
i said starting up
do you mean to tell me that lucy was bitten by such a bat and that such a thing is here in london in the nineteenth century
he waved his hand for silence and went on can you tell me why the tortoise lives more long than generations of men why the elephant gordon and on till he have sees dynasties and why the parrot never die only of bits of caf of dog or other complaint
can you tell me why men believe in all ages and places that there are men and women who can not die
we all know because science has voucher for the fact that there have been to add shut up in rocks for thousands of years shut in one so small hole that only hold him since the youth of the world
can you tell me how the indo sneak it can make himself to die and have been buried and his grave sealed and corn so we do not and the corn dealer and be cut and down and reaped and cut again and then men come and take away the unbroken seal and that there piet hein dish fakir not dead but that rise up and walk amongst them as before
here i interrupted him
i was getting bewildered
he so crowded on my mind his list of nature's eccentricities and possible in possibilities that my imagination was getting fired
i had a dim idea that he was teaching me some lesson as long ago he used to do in his study at amsterdam
but he used them to tell me the thing so that i could have the object of thought in mind all the time
but now i was without his help yet i wanted to follow him so i said professor let me be your pet student again
tell me the thesis so that i may apply your knowledge as you go on
at present i am going in my mind from point to point as a madman and no tax and one follows an idea
i feel like a novice lumbering through a big in amidst jumping from one tussock to another in the mere blind effort to move on without knowing where i am going
that is a good image he said
well i shall tell you
my thesis is this i want you to believe
to believe what
to believe in things that you can not
let me illustrate
i heard once of an american who do defined faith' that faculty which enables us to believe things which we know to be untrue
' for one i follow that man
he meant that we shall have an open mind and not let's little bit of truth check the rush of the big truth like a small rock does a railway truck
we get the small truth first
good
we keep him and we value him but all the same we must not let him think himself all the troy b in the universe
then you want me not to let some previous conviction inure the receptivity of my mind with regard to some strange matter
do i read your lessons right
ah you are my favourite pupil still
it is worth to teach you
now that you are willing to understand you have taken the first step to understand
you think then that those so small holes in the children's throats were made by the same that made the holes in miss lucy
i suppose so
he stood up and said solemnly then you are wrong
it would it were so
but alas
no
it is worse far far worse
in god's name professor van helsing what do you mean
i cried
he threw himself with a despairing gesture into a chair and placed his elbows on the table covering his face with his hands as he spoke
they were made by miss lucy
chapter dr
seward's diary cont
for awhile sheer anger mastered me
it was as if he had during her life struck luck on the face
i smote the table hard and rose up as i said to him dr
van helsing are you mad
he raised his head and looked at me and somehow the tenderness of his face calmed me at once
would i were
he said
madness were easy to bear compared with truth like this
oh my friend why think you did i go so far round why take so long to tell so simple a thing
was it because i hate you and have hated you all my life
was it because i wished to give you pain
was it that i wanted now so late revenge for that time when you saved my life and from a fearful death
anno
forgive me said l
he went on my friend it was because i wished to be gentle in the freaking to you for i know you have loved that so sweet lady
but even yet i do not expect you to believe
it is so hard to accept at once any abstract truth that we may doubt such to be possible when we have always believed the' n o' of it
it is more hard still to accept so sad a concrete truth and of such a one as miss lucy
tonight i go to prove it
dare you come with me
this staggered me
a man does not like to prove such a truth byron excepted from the category jealousy
and prove the very truth be most abhorred
he saw my hesitation and spoke the logic is simple no had man's logic this time jumping from tussock to tussock in a misty bog
if it not be true then proof will be relief
at worst it will not harm
if it be true
ah there is the dread
yet every dread should help my caused or in it is some need of belief
come i tell you what i propose
first that we go off now and see that child in the hospital
dr
vincent of the north hospital where the papers say the child is is a friend of mine and i think of yours since you were in class at amsterdam
he will let two scientists see his case if he will notify two friends
we shall tell him nothing but only that we wish to learn
and then
and then
he took a key from his pocket and held it up
and then we spend the night you and i in the churchyard where lucy kids
this is the key that lock the tomb
i had it from the coffin man to give to arthur
my heart sank within me for i felt that there was some fearful of deal before us
i could do nothing however so i plucked up what heart i could and said that we had better hasten as the afternoon was passing
we found the child awake
it had had asleep and taken some food and altogether was going on well
dr
vincent took the bandage from its throat and showed us the punctures
there was no mistaking the similarity to those which had been on lucy's throat
they were smaller and the edges looked fresher that was all
we asked vincent to what he attributed them and he replied that it must have been a bite of some animal perhaps a rat but for his own part he was inclined to think it was one of the bats which are so numerous on the northern heights of london
out of so many harmless one she said there may be some wild specimen from the south of a more malignant species
some sailor may have brought one home and it managed to escape or even from the zoological gardens a young one may have got loose or one be bred there from a vampire
these things do occur you know
only ten days ago a wolf got out and was i believe traced up in this direction
for a week after the children were playing nothing but red riding hood on the heath and in every alley in the place until this' blooded lady's care came along since then it has been quite a gala time with them
even this poor little more when he woke up today asked the nurse if he might go away
when she asked him why he wanted to go he said he wanted to play with the' blooded lady'
i hope said van helsing that when you are sending the child none you will caution it's parents to keep strict watch over it
these fancies to stray are most dangerous and if the child were to remain out another night it would probably be fatal
but in any case i suppose you will not let it away for some days
certainly not not for a week at least longer if the wound is not healed
our visit to the hospital took more time than we had reckoned on and the sun had dipped before we came out
when van helsing saw how dark it was he said there is not hurry
it is more late than i thought
come let us seek somewhere that we may eat and then we shall go on our way
we dined at' jack straw's castle' along with a little crowd of bicyclists and others who were genially noisy
about teno'clock we started from the inn
it was then very dark and the scattered lampshade the darkness greater when we were once outside their individual radius
the professor had evidently noted the road we were to go for he went on unhesitatingly but as for me i was in quits a mix up as to locality
as we went further we met fewer and fewer people till at last we were somewhat surprised when we met even the patrol of horse police going their usual suburban round
a toast we reached the wall of the churchyard which we climbed over
with some little difficulty for it was very dark and the whole place seemed so strange to us we found the westenra to hb
the professor took the key opened the creaky door and standing back politely but quite unconsciously motioned me to precede him
there was a delicious irony in the offer in the court lines spf giving preference on such a ghastly occasion
my companion followed me quickly and cautiously drew the door to after carefully ascertaining that the lock was a falling and not a springing
in the latter case we should have been in a bad plight
then he fumbled in his bag and taking out a matchbox and a piece of candle proceeded to make a light
the tomb in the daytime and when wreathed with fresh flowers had looked grim and gruesome enough but now some days afterwards when the flowers jun blank and read their whites turning to rust and their greens to browns when the spider and the feeble had resumed their accustomed dominance when the time discoloured stone and dust encrusted mortar and rusty rank iron and tarnished brass and clouded silver plating gave back the feeble glimmer of a band of the effect was more miserable and sordid than could have been imagined
it conveyed irresistibly the idea that life animal life was not the only thing which could pass away
van helsing went about his work systematically
holding his candle so that he could read the coffin plates and so holding it that the sperm dropped in white patches which congealed as they touched the metal he made assurance of lucy's coffin
another search in his bag and he took out a turn screw
what are you going to do
i asked
to open the coffin
you shall yet be convinced
straightway he began taking out the screws and finally lifted off the lid showing the casing of lead beneath
the sight was almost too much for me
it seemed to be as much an affront to the dead as it would have been to have stripped off her clothing in her sleep whilst living
i actually took hold of his hand to stop him
he only said you shall see and again fumbling in his bag took out a tiny feet saw
striking the turn screw through the lead with a swift downwards tag which made me since he made a small hole which was however big enough to admit the point of the saw
i had expected a rush of gas from the week old corpse
we doctors who have had to study our dangers have to become accustomed to such things and i drew back towards the door
but the professor never stopped for a moment
he saw ed down a couple of feet along one side of the lead coffin and then across and down the other side
taking the edge of the loose flange he bent it back towards the foot of the coffin and holding up the candle into the aperture motioned to me to look
i drew near and looked
the coffin was empty
it was certainly a surprise to me and gave me a considerable shock but van helsing was unmoved
he was now more sure than ever of his ground and so emboldened to proceed in his task
are you satisfied nor friend john
he asked
i felt all the dogged argumentative ness of my nature awake within me as i answered him i am satisfied that lucy's body is not in that coffin but that only prove something
and what is that friend john
that it is not there
that is good logic he said so far as it goes
but how do you how can you account for it not being there
perhaps a body snatcher i suggested
some of the undertaker's people may have stolen it
i felt that i was speaking folly and yet it was the only real cause which i could suggest
the professor sighed
ah well
he said we must have more proof
come with me
he put on the coffin lids gain gathered up all his things and placed them in the bag blew out the light and placed the candle also in the bag
we opened the door and went out
behind us be closed the door and locked it
he handed me the key saying will you keep it
you had better be assured
i laughed it was not a very cheerful laugh i am bound to say as i motioned him to keep it
a key is nothing i said there are many duplicates and why how it is not difficult to pick a lock of this kind
he said nothing but put the key in his pocket
then he told me to watch at one side of the churchyard whilst he would watch at the other
i took up my place behind a yew tree and i saw his dark figure move until the intervening headstones and trees hid it from my sight
it was a lonely vigil
just after i had taken my place i heard a distant click strike twelve and in time came one and two
i was chilled and unnerved and angry with the professor for taking me on such an errand and with myself for coming
i was too cold and too sleepy to be keenly observant and not sleepy enough to betray my trust so altogether i had a dreary miserable time
suddenly as i turned round i thought i saw something like a white streak moving between two dark yes trees at the side of the churchyard farthest from the tomb
at the same time a dark mass moved from the professor's side of the ground and hurriedly went towards it
then i took over but i had to go round headstones and tailed off tombs and i stumbled over graves
the sky was overcast and somewhere far off an early cock crew
a little ways off beyond a line of scattered juniper trees which marked the pathway to the church as noted in figure flitted in the direction of the tomb
the tomb itself was hidden by trees and i could not see where the figure had disappeared
i heard the bustle of actual movement where i had first seen the white figure and coming over found the professor holding in his arms a tiny child
when he saw me he held it out to me and said are you satisfied now
no i said in a way that i felt was aggressive
do you not see the child
yes it is a child but who brought it here
and is it wounded
we shall see said the professor and with one impulse we took our way out of the churchyard he carrying the sleeping child
when we had got some little distance away we went into a clump of trees and struck a match and looked at the child's throat
it was without a scratch or scar of any kind
was i right
i asked triumphantly
we were just in time said the professor thankfully
we had now to decide what we were to do with the child and soc insulted about it
if we were to take it to a police station we should have to give some account of our movements during the night
at least we should have had to make some statement as to how we had come to find the child
so finally we decided that we would take it to the heath and when we heard a policeman coming would leave it where he could not fail to find it
we would then seek our way home as quickly as we could
all fell out well
at the edge of hampstead heath we heard a policeman's heavy tramp and laying the child on the pathway we waited and watched until he saw it as he flashed his lantern to and fro
we heard his exclamation of astonishment and then we went away silently
by good chance we got a cab near the' spain is rds' and drove to town
i can not sleep so i make this entry
but i must try to get a few hours' sleep as van helsing is to call for me at noon
he insists that i go with him on another expedition
september
it was twoo'clock before we found a suitable opportunity for our attempt
the funeral held at noon was all completed and the last stragglers of the mourners has taken themselves lazily away when looking carefully from behind a clump of alder trees we saw the sexton lock the gate after tim
we knew that we were safe till morning did we desire it but the professor told me that we should not want more than an hour at most
again i felt that horrid sense of the reality of things in which any effort of imagination seemed out of place and i realized distinctly the perils of the law which we were incurring in our unh allowed work
besides i felt it was all so useless
outrageous as it was to open a leaden coffin to see if a woman dead nearly a week we're really read it now seemed the height of folly to open the tomb again when we knew from the evidence of our own eyesight that the coffin was empty
i shrugged my shoulders however and rested silent for van helsing had a way of going on his own road no matter who demonstrated
he took the key opened the vault and again courteously motioned me to precede
the place was not do gruesome as last night but oh how in utter a boy mean looking when the sunshine streamed in
van helsing walked over to lucy's coffin and i followed
he bent over and again forced back the leader flange and a shock of surprise and dismay shot through me
the relay lucy seemingly just as we had seen her the night before her funeral
she was it possible more radiantly beautiful than ever and i could not believe that she was dead
the lips were red hat redder than before and on the cheeks was a delicate bloom
is this a jungle
i said to him
are you convinced now
said the professor in response and as he spoke he put over his hand and in a way that made me shudder pulled back there a slips and showed the white teeth
see he went on they are even sharper than before
with this and this and he touched one of the canine teeth and that below if the little children can be bitten
are you of belief now friend john
once more argumentative hostility woke within me
i could not accept such an overwhelming ideas she suggested
so with an attempt to argue of which i was even at the moment ashamed i said she may have been placed here since last night
indeed
that is so and by whom
i do not know
someone has done it
and yet she has been dead one week
most peoples in that time would not look so
i had no answer for this so was silent
van helsing did not seem to notice my silence
at any rate he showed neither chagrin not triumph
he was looking intently at the face of the dead woman raising the eyelids and looking at the eyes and once more opening the lips and examining the teeth
then he turned to me and said here there is one thing which is different from all recorded
here is some dual life that is not as the common
she was bitten by the vampire when she was in a trance sleep walking on you start
you do not know that friend john but you shall know it later and in france could be best come to take more blood
in france she dies and in france she is undead top
so it is that she differ from all other
usually when the undead sleep at home as he spoke he made a comprehensive sweep of his arm to designate what to a vampire was' home' their face show what they are but this so sweet that was when she not undead she go back to the nothings of the common dead
there is no malign there are and so it make hard that i must kill her in her sleep
this turned my blood cold and it began to dawn upon me that i was accepting van helsing's theories
but if she were really dead what was there of terror in the idea of killing her
he looked up at me and evidently saw the change in my face for he said almost joyously at you believe now
i answered do not press me too hard all at once
i am willing to accept
how will you do this bloody work
i shall cut off her head and fill her mouth with garlic and i shall drive a stake through her body
it made me shudder to think of so mutilating the body of the woman whom i had loved
and yet the feeling was not so strong as i had expected
i was in fact beginning to shudder at the presence of this being this undead as van helsing called it and to loathe it
is it possible that love is all subjective or all objective
i waited a considerable time for van helsing to begin but he stood as if wrapped in thought
presently he closed the catch of his bag with a snap and said i have been thinking and have made up my mind as to what is best
if i did simply follow my inclining i would do now at this moment what is to be done
but there are other things to follow and things that are thousand times more difficult in that then we do not know
this is simple
sue have yet no life taken though that is of time and to act now would be to take danger from her forever
but then we may have to want arthur and how shall we tell him of this
if you who saw the wounds on lucy's throat and saw the sounds so similar on the child's at the hospital if you who saw the coffin empty last night and full today with a woman who have not change only to be more rose and more beautiful in a whole week after she die if you know of this and know of the white figure last night that brought the child to the churchyard and yet of your own senses you did not believe how then can i expect arthur who know none of those things to believe
he doubted me when i took him from her kiss when she was dying
i know he has forgiven me because in some mistaken idea i have done things that prevent him say goodbye as he ought and he may think that in some more mistaken idea this woman was buried alive and that in most mistake of all we have killed her
he will then argue back that it is we mistaken ones that have killed her by our ideas and site will be much unhappy always
yet he never can be sure and that is the worst of all
and he will sometimes think that she beloved was buried alive and that will paint his dreams with horrors of what she must have suffered and again he will think that we may be right and that his so beloved was after all an undead
no
i told him once and since then i learn much
now since i know it is all true a hundred thousand times more so i know that he must pass through the bitter waters to reach the sweet
he poor fellow must have one hour that will make the very face of heaven grow black to him the need an act for good all round and send him peace
my mind is made up
let us to
you return home for tonight to your asylum and see that all be well
as for me i shall spend the night here in this churchyard in my own way
tomorrow night you will come to me to the berkeley hotel arten of the clock
i shall send for arthur to come too and also that so fine young man of america that gave his blood
later we shall all have work to do
i come with you so far as piccadilly and there done for i must be back here before the sunset
so we picked the tomb and came away and got over the wall of the churchyard which was not much of a task and drove back to piccadilly
note left by van helsing in his portmanteau berkeley hotel directed to john edward m.
d
not delivered september friend john i write this in case anything should happen
i go alone to watch in that churchyard
it pleases me that the undead miss lucy shall not leave tonight that so on the morrow night she may be more eager
therefore i shall fix some things she like hot garlic and a crucifix and so seal up the door of the tomb
she is young as undead and will need
moreover these are only to prevent her coming out
they may not prevail on her wanting to get in for then the undead is desperate and must find the kind of least resistance whatsoever it may be
i shall be at hand all the night from sunset till after sunrise and if there he aught that may be learned i shall learn it
for miss lucy or from her i have no fear but that other to whom is there that she is undead he have not the power to seek her tomb and find shelter
he is cunning as i know from md
jonathan and from the way that all along he have fooled us when he played with us for miss lucy's life and we lost and in many ways the undead are strong
he have always the strength in his hand of twenty men even see our who gave our strength to miss lucy it also is all to him
besides he can summon his wolf and i know not what
so if it be that he came thither on this night he shall find me
but none other small until it be too late
but it may be that he will not attempt the place
there is no reason why he should
his hunting ground is more full of game than the churchyard where the undead woman sleeps and the one old man watch
therefore i write this in case
take the papers that are with this the diaries of market and the rest and read them and then find this great undead and cut off his head and burn his heart or drive a stake through it so that the world may rest from him
if it be so farewell
van helsing
dr
seward's diary september
it is wonderful what a good night's sleep will do for one
yesterday i was almost willing to accept van helsing's monstrous ideas but now they seem to start out lucid before me as outrages on common sense
i have no doubt that he believes it all
i wonder if his mind can have become in any way unhinged
surely there must be some rational explanation of all the army are buoys things
is it possible that the profes aid can have done it himself
he is so abnormally clever that if he went off his head he would carry out his intent with regard to some fixed idea in a wonderful way
i am loathe to think it and indeed it would be almost as great a marvel as the other to find that van helsing was mad but anyhow i shall watch him carefully
i may get some light on the mystery
september
last night at a little before teno'clock arthur and quincey came into van helsing's room
he told us all what he wanted us to do but especially addressing himself to arthur as if all our wills were centres in his
he began by saying that he hoped we would all come with him too for he said there is a grave duty to be done there
you were doubtless surprised at my letter
this query was directly addressed to lord godalming
i was
it rather upset me for a bit
there has been so much trouble around my house of late that i could do without any more
i have been curious to las to what you hear
quincey and i talked it over but the more we talked the more puzzled we got till now i can say for myself that i'm about up a tree as to any meaning about anything
me too said quincey morris la comically
oh said the professor then you are nearer the beginning both of youth an friend john here who has to go along way back before he can even get so far as to begin
it was evident that he recognized my return to my old doubting frame of mind without my saying a word
then turning to the other two he said with intense gravity i want your permission to do what i think good this night
it is i know much to ask and when you know what it is i propose to do you will know and only then how much
therefore may i ask that you promise me in the dark so that afterwards though you may be angry with me for a time i must not disguise from myself the possibility that such maybe you shall not blame yourselves for anything
that's frank anyhow broke in quincey
i'll answer for the professor
idon't quite see his drift but i swear he's honest and that's good enough for me
i thank you sir said van helsing proudly
i have done myself the honour of counting you one trusting friend and such endorsement is dead home
he held out a hand which quincey took
then arthur spoke out dr
van helsing idon't quite like to' buy a pig in spoke' as they say in scotland and if it be anything in which my honour as a gentleman of my faith as a christian is concerned i can not make such a promise
if you can assure me that what you intend does not violate either of these two then i give my consent at once thought of the life of me i can not understand what you are driving at
i accept your limitation said van helsing and all i ask if you is that if you feel it necessary to condemn any act of mine you will first consider it well and be satisfied that it does not violate your reservations
agreed
said arthur
that is only fair
and now that the pour parker's are over may i ask what it is we are to do
i want you to come with me and to come in secret to the churchyard at kings head
arthur's cave cells she said in an amazed sort of way where poor lucy is buried
the professor bowed
arthur dent on and when there
to enter the tomb
arthur stood up
professor are you in earnest or is it some monstrous joke
pardon me i see that you are in earnest
he sat down again but i could see that he sat firmly and proudly as one who is on his dignity
there was silence until he asked again and when in the tomb
to open the coffin
this is too much
he said angrily rising again
i am willing to be patient in all things that are reasonable but in this this desecration of the grave of one who
he fairly choked with indignation
the professor looked putting it at him
if i could spare you one pang my poor friend he said god knows i would
but this might our feet must tread in thorny paths or later and forever the feet you love must walk in paths of flame
arthur looked up with set white face and said take care sir take care
would it not be well to hear what i have to say
sale van helsing
and then you will at least know the limit of my purpose
shall i go on
that's fair enough broke in morris
after a pause van helsing went on evidently with an effort miss lucy is dead is it not so
yes
then there can be no wrong time d
but if she be not dead
arthur jumped to his feet good god
he cried
what do you mean
has there been any mistake has she been buried alive
he groaned in anguish that not even hope could soften
i did not say she was alive my child
i did not think it
i go no further than to say that she might be undead
undead
not alive
what do you mean
is this all a nightmare of what is it
there are mysteries which men can only guess at which are by age they may solve only in part
believe me we are now on the verge of one
but i have not done
may i cut off the head of dead miss lucy
heavens and earth no
cried arthur in a storm of passion
not for the wide world will i consent to any mutilation of her dead body
dr
van helsing you try me too far
what have i done to you that you should torture me so
what did that poor sweet girl do that you should want to cast such dishonour on her grave
are you had that you speak of such things or an imac to listen to them
don'ts are think more of such a desecration
i shall not give my consent to anything you do
i have a duty to do in protecting her grave from outrage and by god i shall do it
van helsing rose up from where he had all the time been seated and said gravely and sternly my lord godalming i too have a duty to do a duty to others a duty to you a duty to the dead and by god i shall do it
all i ask you now is that you come with me that you look and listen and it when later i make the same request you do not be more eager for its fulfillment even than i am then i shall do my duty whatever it may seem to me
and then to follow your lordship's wishes i shall hold myself at your disposal to render an account to you when and where you will
his voice broke a little and he went on with a voice full of pity
but i beseech you do not go forth in anger with me
in a long life of acts which were often not pleasant to do and which sometimes did wrong my heart i have never had so heavy at ask a show
believe me that if the time comes for you to change your mind towards me one look from you will wipe away all this so sad hour for i would do what a man can to save you from sorrow
just think
for why should i give myself so much labor and so much of sorrow
i have come here from my own land to do what i can of good at the first to please my friend john and then to help a sweet young lady whom took some to love
for her i am ashamed to say so much but i say it in kindness i have what you have the blood of my veins
i gave it i who was not like you her lover but only her physician and her friend
i gave her my nights and days before death after death and if my death can do her good even now when she is the dead undead she shall have it freely
he said this with a very grave sweet pride and arthur was much affected by it
he took the old man's hand and said in a broken voice on it is hard to think of it and i can not understand but at least i shall go with you and wait
chapter dr
seward's diary cont
it was just a charter before twelveo'clock when we got into the churchyard over the low wall
the night was dark with occasional gleams of moonlight between the debts of the heavy clouds that scudder across the sky
we all kept somehow close together with van helsing slightly in front as he led the way
when we had come close to the tomb i looked well at arthur for i feared the proximity to a place laden with so sorrowful a memory would upset him but before himself well
i took it that the very mystery of the price rving was in some ways counteract ant to his grief
the professor unlocked the door and seeing a natural hesitation amongst us for various reasons solved the difficulty by entering first himself
the rest of us followed and he closed the door
he then out a dark lantern and pointed to a coffin
arthur stepped forward hesitatingly
van helsing said to me you were with me here yesterday
was the body of miss lucy in that coffin
it was
the professor turned to the rest saying you hear and yet there is no one who does not believe with me
he took his screwdriver and again took off the lid of the coffin
arthur looked on very pale but silent
when the lid was removed he stepped forward
he evidently did not know that there was a leaden coffin or at any rate had not thought of it
when he saw the rent in the lead the blood rushed to his face for an instant but as quickly fell away again so that he remained of a ghastly whiteness
he was still silent
van helsing forced back the leaden flange and we all looked in and recoiled
the coffin was empty
for several minutes no one spoke a word
the silence was broken by quincey morris professor i answered for you
your word is all i want
i wouldn' task such a thing ordinarily i wouldn' two dishonour you as to imply a doubt but this is a mystery that goes beyond any honour of dishonour
is this your doing
i swear to you by all that i hold sacred that i have not removed or touched her
what happened was this
two nights ago my friend seward and i came here with good purpose believe me
i opened that coffin which was then scaled up and we found it as now empty
we then waited and saw something white come through the trees
the next day we came here in daytime and she lay there
did she not friend john
yes
that night we were just in time
one more so small child was missing and we find it thank god unharmed amongst the graves
yesterday i came here before sundown for at sundown the undead can move
i waited here all night till the sunrise but i saw nothing
it was most probable that it was because i had laid over the clamps of those doors garlic which the undead can not bear and other things which they shun
last night there was no exodus so tonight before the sundown i took away my garlic and other things
and so it is we find this coffin empty
but bear with ms
so far there is much that is strange
wait you with me outside unseen and unheard and things much stranger are yet to be
so here he shut the dark slide of his lantern how to the outside
he opened the door and we filed out becoming last and locking the door behind him
oh
but it seemed fresh and pure in the night air after the terror of that vault
how sweet it was to see the clouds race by and the passing gleams of the moonlight between the scuffing clouds crossing and passing like the gladness and sorrow of a man's life
how sweet it was to breathe the fresh air that had no taint of death and decay
how humanizing to see the red lighting of the sky beyond the hill and to hear far away the muffled road that marks the life of a great city
each in his own way was solemn and overcome
arthur was silent and was i could see striving to grasp the purpose and the inner meaning of the mystery
i was myself tolerably patient and half inclined again to throw a side doubt and to accept van helsing's conclusions
quincey morris was phlegmatic in the way of a man who accepts all things and accepts them in the spirit of cool be a vary with hazard of all he has at stake
not being able to smoke he cut himself a good sized plug of tobacco and began to chew
as to van helsing he was employed in a debug its way
first he took from his bags mass of what looked like thin water like biscuit which was carefully rolled up in a white napkin
next he took out a double handful of some whitish stuff like cough or putty
he crumbled the water up fine and worked it into the mass between his hands
this he then took and rolling it into thin strips began to lay them into the crevices between the door and its setting in the tomb
i was somewhat puzzled at this and being close asked him what it was that he was doing
arthur and quincey drew near also as they too were curious
he answered i am closing the tomb so that the undead may not enter
and is that stuff you have the're going to do it
it is
what is that which you are using
this time the question was by arthur
van helsing reverently lifted his hat as he answered
the host
i brought it from amsterdam
i have an indulgence
it was an answer that appalled the most sceptical of us and we felt individually that in the presence of such earnest purpose as the professor's a purpose which could thus use the robin most sacred of things it was impossible to distrust
in respectful silence we took the places assigned to us close round the tomb but hidden from the sight of anyone approaching
i put off the others especially arthur
i had myself been apprenticed by my former visits to this watching horror and yeti who had up to an hour ago repudiated the proofs felt my heart sink within me
never did tombs look so ghastly white
never did cypress or new or juniper so seen the embodiment of funeral gloom
never did tree or grass wave of rustle so ominously
never did bough see also mysteriously and never did the far away howling of dogs send such a woeful presage through the night
there was a long spell of silence big acting void and then from the professor queens sss
he pointed and far down the avenue of jews we saw a white figure advance as i'm white figure which held something dark at its breast
the figure stopped and at the moment a day of moonlight fell upon the masses of driving clouds and showed in startling prominence a dark haired woman dressed in these're ments of the grave
we could not see the face for it was bent down over what we saw to be a fair haired child
there was a pause and a sharp little cry such as a child gives in sleep or a dog as it lies before the fire and dreams
we were starting forward but the professor's warning hand seen by us as he stood behind a yew tree kept us back
and then as we looked the white figure moved forward s again
it was now near enough for us to see clearly and the moonlight still held
my own heart grew cold aside and i could hear the gasp of arthur as we recognized the features of lucy westenra
lucy westenra but yet how changed
the sweetness was turned to adamantine heartless cruelty and the purity to voluptuous wantonness
van helsing stepped out and obedient to his gesture we all advanced top
the four of us ranged in a line before the door of the tomb
van helsing raised his lantern and drew the slide
by the concentrated light that fell on lucy's face we could see that the lips were crimson with fresh blood and that the stream had trickled over her chin and drained the purity of her lawn death to be
we shuddered with horror
i could see by the tremulous light that even van helsing's iron nerve has failed
arthur was next time and if i had not seized his arm and held him up he would have fallen
when lucy of all the thing that was before us lucy because ignore her shapes asus she drew back with an angry snarl such as a cat gives when taken unawares then her eyes range rover us
lucy's eyes inform and colour but lucy's eyes unclean and full of hellfire instead of the pure gentle or base knew
at that moment the remnant of my love passed into hate and loathing
had she then to be killed i could have done it with savage delight
as she looked her eyes glazed with unholy light and the face became wreathed with a voluptuous while
oh god how it made me shudder to see it
with a careless motion she clung to the ground callous as a devil the child that up to now she had clutched strenuously to her breast growling over it as a song rocks over a bone
the child have a sharp cry and lay there moaning
there was a cold blooded news in the act which wrung a groan from arthur
when she advanced to him with outstretched arms and a wanton smile he fell back and hit his face in his hands
she still advanced however and with a languorous voluptuous grace said some time arthur
leave these others and come home
my arms are hungry for you
come and we can rest together
come my husband come
there was something diabolically sweet inner tones something of the tiny libc of glass when struck which rang through the brain seven of us who heard the words addressed to another
as for arthur he seemed under a spell moving his hands from his face he opened wide his arms
she was leaping for them when van helsing sprang forward and held between them his little golden crucifix
she recoiled from it and with a suddenly distorted face full of rage dashed past him as it to enter the tomb
when within a foot or two or the door however she stopped as if arrested by some irresistible force
then she turned and her face was shown in the clear burst of moonlight and by the lamp which had now no quiver from van helsing's nerves
never did i see such baffled malice in a face and never i trust shall such ever be seen again by mortal eyes
the beautiful colour became livid the eyes seemed to throw out sparks of hellfire the broad were wrinkled as though the folds of flesh were the coils of medusa's snakes and the lovely bloodstained mouth grew to an open square as on the passion masks of the greeks and japanese
if ever a face meant death it looks could kill we saw it at that moment
and so for full half a minute which seemed an eternity she remained between the lifted crucifix and the sacred closing other means of entry
van helsing broke the silence by asking arthur answer me oh my friend
alito process in my work
do as you will friend
do as you will
there can be no horror like this ever any more
and he groaned in spirit
quincey and i simultaneously moved towards him and took his arms
we could hear the click of the closing lantern as van helsing held it down
coming close to the tomb he began to remove from the chinks some of the sacred emblem which he had placed there
we all looked in with horrified amazement as we saw when he stood back the woman with a corporeal body as real at that moment as our own pass through the interstices here scarce a knife blade could have gone
we all delta glad sense of relief when we saw the professor calmly restoring the strings of putty to the edges of the door
when this was done he lifted the child and said somehow my friends
we can do no more till tomorrow
there is a funeral at noon so here we shall all come before long after that
the friends of the dead will all be gone by two and when the sexton locks the gate we shall remain
then there is more to do but not like this of tonight
as for this little one he is not much harmed and by tomorrow night he shall be well
we shall leave him where the police will find him as on the other night and then to home
coming close to arthur he said my friend arthur you have had a sore trial but after when you look back you will see how it was necessary
you are now in the bitter waters my child
by this time tomorrow you will please god have passed them and have drunk of the sweetwater's
so do not mourn over much
till then i shall not ask you to forgive me
arthur and quincey came home with me and we tried to cheer each other on the way
we had left behind the child in safety and we retired
so we all slept with more or less reality of sleep
september night
a little her pre twelveo'clock we three arthur quincey morris and myself called for the professor
it was led to notice that by common consent we had all put on black clothes
of course arthur wore black for he was in deep mourning but the rest of us wore it by instinct
we got to the graveyard by half past one and strolled about keeping out of official observation so that when the grave digger's had completed their task and the sexton under the belief that everyone had gone had locked the gate we had the place all to ourselves
van helsing instead of his little black bag had with him along leather one something like a cricketing bag
it was manifestly of fair weight
when we were alone and had heard the last of the footsteps die put up the road we silently and as if by ordered intention followed the professor to the tomb
he unlocked the door and we entered closing it behind us
then he took from his bag the lantern which he lit and also two wax candles which when lighted he stuck by melting their own ends on other coffins so that they might give light sufficient to work by
when he again lifted the lid off lucy's coffin we all looked arthur trembling like an aspen and saw that the corpse lay there in all its death beauty
but there was no love in my own heart nothing but loathing for the foul thing which had taken lucy's shape without her soul
i could see even arthur's face grow hard as he looked
presently he said to van helsing is this really lucy's body or only a demon in her shape
it is her body and yet not it
but wait awhile and you shall see her as she was and is
she seemed like a nightmare of lucy as she lay there the pointed teeth the blood stained voluptuous mouth which made one shudder to see the whole carnal and in spirited appearance seeming like a devilish mockery of lucy's sweet purity
van helsing with his usual methodical news began taking the various contents from his bag and placing them ready for use
first he took out a soldering iron and some plumbing solder and then small oil lamp which gave our when lit on a corner of the tomb gas which burned at a fierce heat with a blue flame then his operating knives which he placed to hand and last around wooden stake some two and a half of three inches thick and about three feet long
one end of it was hardened by charging in the fire and was sharpened to a fine point
with this stake came a heavy hammer such as in households is used in the coal cellar for breaking the pumps
to me a doctor's preparations for work of any kind are stimulating and bracing but the effect of these things on both arthur and quincey was to cause them a sort of consternation
they both however kept their courage and remained silent and quiet
when all was ready van helsing said before we do anything let me tell you this
it is out of the lord and experience of the ancients and of all those who have studied the powers of the undead
when they become such there comes with the change the curse of immortality
they can not die but must go on age after age adding new victims and multiplying the evils of the world
for all that die from the preying of the undead become themselves undead and prey on their kind
and so the circle goes on ever widening like as the ripples from a stone thrown in the water
friend arthur if you had met that kiss which you know it before poorly cycle or again last night when you open your arms to her you would in time when you had died have become nosferatu as they call it in eastern europe and would for all time make more of those undead's that do have filled us with horror
the career of this so unhappy dear lady is but just begun
those children whose blood she sucked are not as yet so much the worse but if she lives on undead more and more they lose their blood and by her power over them they come to her and so she draw their blood with that so wicked mouth
but if she did in truth then solve ase
the tiny wounds of the throats disappear and they go back to their play in knowing ever of what has been
but of the most blessed of all when this now undead be made to rest as true dead then the soul of the poor lady whom we love shall again be free
instead of working wickedness by night and growing more d e based on the assimilating of it by day she shall take her place with the other angels
so that my friend it will be a blessed hand for her that shall strike the flow that sets her free
to this i am willing but is the genome amongst us who has a better right
will it be no joy to think of hereafter in the silence of the night when sleep is not' it was my hand that sent her to the stars
it was the hand of him that loved her best them and that of all she would herself have chosen had it been to her to choose
' tell me if there be such a one amongst us
we all looked at arthur
he saw too what we all did the infinite kindness which suggested that his should be the hand which would restore lucy to us as a holy and not an unholy memory
he stepped forward and said gravely though his hand trembled and his face was as pale as snow my true friend from the bottom of my broken heart i thank you
tell me what i am to do and i shall not falter
van helsing laid abandon his shoulder and said brave law
a moment's courage and it is done
this stake must be driven through her
if we'll be a fearful or deal be not received in that but it will be only a short time and you will then rejoice more than your pain was great
from this grim tomb you will emerge as though you tread on air
but you must not falter when once you have begun
only think that we your true friends are found you and that we pray for you all the time
go on said arthur hoarsely
tell me what i am to do
take this stake in your left hand ready to place to the point over the heart and the hammering out right
then when we begin our prayer for the dead i shall read him i have here the book and the others shall follow strike in god's name that so all may be well with the dead that we love and that the undead pass away
arthur took the stake and the hammer and when once his mind was set in action his hands never trembled not even quivered
van helsing opened his missal and began to read and quincey and i followed as well as we could
arthur placed the point over the heart and as i looked i could see its dont in the white flesh
then he struck with all his might
the thing in the coffin writhed and a hideous blood curdling screech came from the opened red lips
the body shook and quivered and twisted in wild contortions
the sharp white teeth chan per together till the lips were cut and the mouth was smeared with a crimson foam
but arthur never faltered
he looked like a figure of thora suisun trembling arm rose and fell driving deeper and deeper the mercy bearings take whilst the blood from the pierced heart welles and courted up around it
his face was set and high duty seemed to shine through it
the sight of it gave us courage so that our voices seemed to ring through the little vault
and then the writhing and quivering of the body became less and the teeth seemed to champ and the face to quiver
finally it lay still
the terrible task was over
the hammer fell from arthur's hand
he reeled and would have fallen had we not caught him
the great drops of sweat sprang from his forehead and his breath came unbroken gasps
it had indeed been an awful strain on him and had he not been forced to his task by more than human considerations he could never have gone through with it
for a few minutes we were so taken up with him that we did not look towards the coffin
when we did however a murmur of startled surprise ran from one to the other of us
we gazed so eagerly that arthur road for he had been seated on the ground and came and looked too and the hablar strange light broke over his face and dispelled altogether the gloom of horror that lay upon it
there in the coffin pay no longer the foul thing that we had so dressed and grown to hate that the work offer destruction was yielded as a privilege to the one best entitled to it but lucy as we had seen her in life with her face of unequalled sweetness and purity
true that there were there as we had seen them in life the traces of care and pain and waste
but these were all dear to us for they marked her truth to what we knew
one and all we felt that the holy calm that lay like sunshine over the wasted face and form was only an earthly token and symbol of the calm that was foreign forever
van helsing cams and laid his hand on arthur's shoulder and said to him and now arthur my friends earl adami not forgiven
the reaction of the terrible strain same as he took the old man's hand in his and raising it to his lips pressed it and said forgiven
god bless you that you have given my dear one her soul again and me leave
he put his hands on the professor's shoulder and laying his head on his breast cried for awhile silently whilst we stood in moving
when he raised his head van helsing said to him and now my child you may kiss her
kiss her dead lips if you will as she would have you to it forget to choose
for she is not a grinning devil now not anymore a foul thing for all eternity
no longer she is the devil's undead
she is god's true dead whose soul us with him
arthur bent and kissed her and then we sent him and quincey out of the tomb
the professor and i sawed the ripper the stake leaving the point of it in the body
then we cut off the head and filled the mouth with garlic
we soldered up the leaden coffin screwed on the coffin lid and gathering up our belongings came away
when the professor locked the door he gave the key to arthur
outside the air was sweet the sunshine and the birds sang and it seemed as if all nature were tuned to a different pitch
there was gladness and mirth and peace everywhere for we were a treat ourselves on one account and we were glad though it was with a tempered joy
before we moved away van helsing said now my friends one step of our work is done one the most harrowing to ourselves
but there remains a greater task to find out the author of all this our sorrow and to stamp him out
i have clues which we can follow but it is a long task and a difficult one and there is danger in it and pain
shall you not all help me
we have learned to believe all of us is it not so
and since so does not see our city
yes
and does not promise to go onto the bitter end
each in turn we took his hand and the promise was made
then said the professor as we moved off two nights hence you shall meet with me and dine together at seven of the clock with friend john
i shall entreat two others two that you know not as yet and i shall be ready to all our work show and our plans unfold
friend john you come with me home for i have much to consult you about and you can help me
tonight i leave for amsterdam but shall return tomorrow night
and then begins our great quest
but first i shall have much to say so that you may know what to do and to dread
then our promise shall be made to each other a new
for there is a terrible task before us and once our feet are on the plough share we must not draw back
chapter dr
seward's diary cont
when we arrived at the berkely hotel van helsing found a telegram waiting for him
am coming up by train
jonathan at whitby
important news
mina harker
the professor was delighted
at that wonderful had an min she said pearl among women
she arrive but i can not stay
she must go to your house friend john
you must meet her at the station
telegraph her en route so that she may be prepared
when the site was dispatched he had a cup of tea
over it he told me of a diary kept by jonathan harker when a broad and gave me a typewritten copy of it as also of mrs.
harker's diary at whitby
take these he said and study them well
when i have returned you will be master of all the facts and we can then better enter on our inquisition
keep them safe for there is in them much of treasure
you will need all your faith even you who have had such an experience as that of today
what is here told he laid his hand heavily and gravely on the packet of papers as he spoke may be the beginning of the end to you and me and many another or it may sound the knell of the undead who walk the earth
read all i pray you with the open mind and if you can add in any way to the story here told do so for it is all important
you have kept a diary of all these do strange things is it not so
yes
then we shall go through all these together when we meet
he then made ready for his departure and shortly drove off to liverpool street
i took my way to paddington where i arrived about fifteen minutes before the train came in
the crowd melted away after the bustling fashion common to arrival platforms and i was beginning to feel uneasy lest i might miss my guest when a sweet faced dainty looking girl stepped up to me and after a quick glance said dr.
seward is it not
and you are mrs
harker
i answered at once whereupon she held out her hand
i knew you from the description of poor dear lucy but
she stopped suddenly and a quick blush over spread her face
then push that rose to my own cheeks somehow set is both at ease for it was a tacit answer to her own
i got her luggage which included a typewriter and we took the underground to fenchurch street after i had sent a wire to my house keeper to have a sitting room and a bedroom prepared at once for ura
harker
in due time we arrived
she knew of course that the place was a lunatic asylum but i could see that she was unable to repress a shudder when we entered
she told me that if she might she would come presently to my study as she had much to say
so here is'm finishing my entry in my phonograph diary whilst i await her
as yet i have not had the chance of looking at the papers which van helsing left with me though they lie open before me
i must get her interested in something so that i may have an opportunity of reading them
she does not know how precious time is or what a task we have inhand
i must be careful not to frighten her
here she is
nina marked's journal september
after i had to died myself i went down to dr
seward's study
at the door i paused a moment for i thought i heard him talking with someone
as however he had pressed me to be quick i knocked at the door and on his calling out come in. i entered
to my intense surprise there was no one with him
he was quite alone and on the table opposite him was what i knew at once from the description to be a phonograph
i had never seen one and was much interested
i hope i did not keep you waiting i said but i stayed at the door as i heard you talking and thought there was someone with you
oh he replied with a smile i was only entering my diary
your diary
i asked him in surprise
he she answered
i keep it in this
as he spoke he laid his hand on the phonograph
i felt quite excited over it and blurted out why this beats even shorthand
may i hear it say something
certainly he replied with alacrity and stood up to put it in train for speaking
then he paused and a troubled look over spread his face
the fact is he began awkwardly i only keep my diary unit and as it is entirely almost entirely about it cases it may be awkward that is i mean
he stopped and i tried to help him out of his embarrassment
you helped to attend dear lucy at the end
let me hear how she died for all that i know of her i shall be very grateful
she was very very dear home
to my surprise he answered with a horror struck look in his face tell you of her death
not for the wide world
why not
i asked for some grave terrible feeling was coming over me
again he paused and i could see that he was trying to invent an excuse
at length he stammered out you see i do not know how to pick out any particular part of the diary
even while he was speaking an idea dawned upon him and he said with unconscious simplicity in a different voice and with the naivete of a child that's quite true upon my honour
honest indian
i could not but smile at which he grimaced
i gave myself away that time
he said
but do you know that although i have kept the diary for months past it never once struck me how i was going to find any particular part of it in case i wanted to look it up
by this time my mind was made up that the diary of a doctor who attended lucy might have something to add to the sum of our knowledge of that terrible being and i said boldly the gdr
seward you had better let me copy it out for you on my typewriter
he grew to a positively deathly pallor as he said no
no
no
for all the world
iwouldn't let you know that terrible story
then it was terrible
my intuition was right
for a moment i thought and as my eyes ranged the room unconsciously looking for something or some opportunity to que me they put on a great batch of type writing on the table
his eyes caught the look in mind and without his thinking followed their direction
as they saw the parcel he realized my meaning
you do not know me i said
when you have read those papers my own diary and my husband's also which i have typed you will know me better
i have not faltered in giving every thought of my own heart in this cause
but of course you do not know meyer and i must not expect you to trust me so far
he is certainly a major noble nature
poor dear lucy was right about him
he stood up and opened a large drawer in which were arranged in order a number of hollow cylinders of metal covered with dark wax and said you are quite right
i did not trust you because i did not know you
but i know you now and let me say that i should have known you long ago
i know that lucy told you of me
she told me if you too
may i make the only atonement in my power
take the cylinders and hear them
the first half dozen of the mars personal tome and they will not horrify you
then you will know me better
dinner will by then be ready
on the meantime i shall read over some of these documents and shall be better able to understand certain things
he carried the phonograph himself up to my sitting room and adjusted it for me
now i shall learn something pleasant i am sure
for it will tell me the other side of a true love episode of which i know one side already
dr
seward's diary september
i was so absorbed in that wonderful diary of jonathan harker and that other of his wife that i let the time run on without thinking
mrs
barker was not down when the maid came to announce dinner so i said she is possibly tired
let dinner wait an hour and i went on with my work
i had just finished new
harker's diary when she came on
she looked sweetly pretty but very sad and her eyes were flushed with crying
this somehow moved me much
of late i have had cause for years god knows
but the relief of them was denied me and now the sight of those sweet eyes brightened by recent years went straight to my heart
so i said as gently as i could i greatly fear i have distressed you
oh no not distressed me she replied
but i have been more touched than i can say by your grief
that is a wonderful machine but it is cruelly true
it told me in its very toned the anguish of your heart
it was like a soul crying out to almighty god
no one must hear them spoke never again
see i have tried to be useful
i have copied out the words only typewriter and none other need now hear your heartbeat as i did
no one need ever know shall ever know i said in a low voice
she laid her hand on mine and said very gravely am but they must
must
but why
i asked
because it is a part of the terrible story apart or poor lucy's death and all that led to it
because in the struggle which we have before us to rid the earth of this terrible monster we must have all the knowledge and all the help which we can get
i think that the cylinders which you gave me contained more than you intended me to know
but i can see that there are in your record many lights to this dark mystery
you will let me help will you not
i know all up to a certain point and i see already though your diary only took me to september how poor lucy was beset and how her terrible room was being wrought out
jonathan and i have been working day and night since professor van helsing saw us
he is gone to whitby to get more information and he will be here tomorrow to help us
we need have no secrets amongst us
working together and with absolute trust we can surely be stronger than if some of us were in the dark
she looked at me so appealingly and at the same time manifested such courage and resolution in her hearing that i have in at once to her wishes
you shall i said so as you like in the matter
god forgive me if i do wrong
there are terrible things yet to learn of but if you have so far traveled in the road to poor lucy's death you will not be content i know to remain in the dark
jay the end the very end may give you a gleam of peace
come there is dinner
we must keep one another strong for what is before us
we have a cruel and dreadful task
when you have eaten you shall learn the rest and i shall answer any questions you ask if there be anything which you do not understand though it was apparent to us who were present
mina marker's journal september
after dinner i came with dr.
seward to his study
he brought back the phonograph from my room and i took a chair and arranged the phonograph so that i could touch it without getting up and showed me how to stop it in case i should want to pause
then be very thoughtfully took a chair with his back to me so that i might be as free as possible and began to read
i put the former metal tin years and listened
when the terrible story of lucy's death and all that followed was done i lay back in my chair powerless
fortunately i am not of a fainting disposition
when dr.
seward saw me he jumped up with a horrified excl a nation and hurriedly taking a case bottle from the cupboard gave me some brandy which in a few minutes somewhat restored me
my brain was all in a whirl and only that there came through all the multitude of horrors the holy day of light that my dear lucy was at last at peace i do not think i could have borne it without making a scene
it is all so wild and mysterious and strange that if i had not known jonathan's experience in transylvania i could not have believed
as it was i didn't know what to believe and so got out of my difficulty by attending to something else
i took the cover off my typewriter and said todd
seward let me write this all out now
we must be ready for dr
van helsing when he comes
i have sent a telegram to jonathan to come on here when he arrives in london from whitby
in this matter dates are everything and i think that if we get all of our material ready and have every item put in chronological order we shall have done much
you tell me that lord godalming and mr.
morris are coming too
let us be able to tell them when they come
he accordingly set the phonograph at a slow pace and i began to type write from the beginning of the seventeenth cylinder
i used manifold and so took three copies of the diary just as i had done with the rest
it was late when i got through buyer
seward went about his work of going his round of the patients
when he had finished he came back and sat near me reading so that i did not feel too lonely whilst i worked
how good and thoughtful he is
the world seems full of good men even if there are monsters in it
before i left him i remembered what jonathan put in his diary of the professor's perturbation at reading something in an evening paper at the station at exeter speeding that dr
seward keeps his newspapers i borrowed the files of' the westminster gazette' and' the pall mall gazette' and took them to my room
i remember how much the' daily graph' and' the whitby gazette' of which i had made cuttings had helped us to understand the terrible events at whitby when count dracula landed so i shall look through the evening papers since then and perhaps i shall get some new light
i am not sleepy and the work will help your time quiet
dr
seward's diary september
mr
mark we arrived at nineo'clock
he got his wife's wife just before starting
he is uncommonly clever if one can judge from his face and full of energy
if this journal be true and judging by one's own wonderful experiences it must be he is also a man of great berge
that going down to the vaults second time was a remarkable piece of dating
after reading his account of it i was prepared to meet a good specimen of manhood but hardly the quiet business like gentleman who came here today
later
after lunch marker and his wife went back to their own room and as i passed a while ago i heard the click of the typewriter
they are hard at it
mrs
harker says that they are knitting together in chronological order every scrap of evidence they have
market has got the letters between the consignee of the boxes at whitby and the carriers in london who took charge of them
he is now reading his wife's transcript of my diary
i wonder what they make out of it
here it is
strange that it never struck me that the very next house might be the count's hiding place
goodness knows that we had enough clues from the conduct of the patient renfield
the bundle of letters relating to the purchase of the house were with the transcript
oh if we had only had them earlier we might have saved poor lucy
shop
that way madness lies
market has gone back and is again collecting material
he says that by dinner time they will be able to show a whole connected narrative
he thinks that in the meantime i should see renfield as hitherto he has been a sort of index to the coming and going of the count
i hardly see this yet but when i get at the dates i suppose i shall
what a good thing that mrs.
harker put my cylinders in to type
we never could have found the dates otherwise
i found renfield sitting placidly in his room with his hands folded smiling benignly
at the moment he seemed as same as anyone i ever saw
i sat down and talked with him on a lot of subjects all of which he treated naturally
he then on his own accord spoke of going home a subject he has never mentioned to my knowledge during his sojourn here
in fact he spoke quite confidently of getting his discharge at once
i believe that had in it had the chat with market and read the letters and the dates of his outbursts i should have been prepared to sign for him after a brief time of observation
as it is i am darkly suspicious
all those outbreaks were in some way linked with the proximity of the count
what then does this absolute content mean
can it be that his instinct is satisfied as to the vampire's ultimate triumph
stay
he is himself zilpha to us and in his wild ravings outside the chapel door of the deserted house he always spoke of' master'
this all seems confirmation of our idea
however after awhile i came away
my friend is just a little too same at present to make it safe to prove him too deep with questions
he might begin to think and then
so i came away
i must rush these quiet moods of his so i have given the attendant a hint to look closely after him and to have a strait waistcoat ready in case of need
johnathan harker's journal september intra into london
when i received mr
billington's courteous message that he would give me any information in his power i thought it best to go down to whitby and make on the spot such inquiries as i wanted
it was now my object to trade that horrid cargo of the count's to its place in london
later we may be able to deal with it
billington junior a nice law met me at the station and brought me to his father's house where they had decided that i must spend the night
they are hospitable with true yorkshire hospitality give a guest everything and leave him to do as he likes
they all knew that i was busy and that my stay was short and mr.
billington had ready in his office all the papers concerning the consignment of boxes
it gave me almost a turn to see again one of the letters which i had seen on the count's table before i knew of his diabolical plans
everything had been carefully thought out and done systematically and with precision
he seemed to have been prepared for every obstacle which might be placed by accident in the way of his intentions being carried out
to use an americanism he had' taken no chances' and the absolute accuracy with which his instructions were fulfilled was simply the logical result of his care
i saw the invoice and took note of it
' fifty cases of common earth to be used for experimental purposes'
also the copy of the letter to carter paterson and their reply
of both these i got copies
this was all the information mr
bollington could give me so i went down to the port and saw the coast guard's the customs officers and the harbour master who kindly put me in communication with the men who had actually received the boxes
their tally was exact with the list and they had nothing to add to the simple description' fifty cases of common earth' except that the boxes were' main and mortal heavy' and that shifting them was dry work
one of the masses that it was hard lines that therewasn'ta by gentleman' suchlike as like yourself squire' to show some sort of appreciation of their efforts in a liquid form
another put in a rider that the thirst then generated was such that even the time which had elapsed had not completely allah edit
needless to add i took care before leaving to lift forever and adequately this source of reproach
september
the station master's as good enough to give me alone to his old companion the station master at king's cross so that when i arrived there in the morning i was able to ask him about the arrival of the boxes
he too put me at once in communication with the proper officials and i saw that their tally was correct with the original invoice
the opportunities of acquiring an abnormal thirst had been here limited
a noble use of them had how ever been made and again i was compelled to deal with the result in ex post facto manner
from thence i went to carter paterson's central office where i met with the utmost courtesy
they looked up the transaction in their way book and letter book and at once telephoned to their king's cross office for more details
by good fortune the men who did the framing were waiting for work and the official at once sent them over sending also by one of them the way bill and all the papers connected with the delivery of the boxes at carfax
here again i found the tally agreeing exactly
the carriers' men were able to supplement the paucity of the written words with a few more details
these were i shortly found connected almost solely with the dusty nature of the job and the consequent thirst engendered in the operators
on my afford ing an opportunity through the medium of the currency of the realm of the allaying at a later period this beneficial evil one of the man remarked that'sts'o user id' not is the funniest i ever was in
blume
but ihain't been touched sense a hundred years
there was dust that thick in the place that you might have a pep' on it without' yet in' other bones
an' the place was that neglected that her might's've smells role jerusalem in it
but the old chapel that took the file that did
me and my mate wet hort wewouldn't never got out quick enough
log' iwouldn't take less nor a quid a moment to stay there after dark
having been in the house i could well believe him but if he knew what i know he would i think have raised his terms
if one thing i am now satisfied
that all those boxes which arrived at whitby from varna in the demeter were safely deposited in the old chapel at carfax
there should be fifty of them there unless any have since been removed as from dr
seward's diary i fear
later
mina and i have worked all day and we have put all the papers in to order
tina harker's journal september
i am so glad that i hardly know how to contain myself
it is i suppose the reaction from the haunting fear which i have had that this terrible affair and the reopening of his old wound might act detrimentally on jonathan
i saw him leave for whitby with as brave a face as could but i was sick with apprehension
the effort has however done him good
he was never so resolute never so strong never so full of volcanic energy as at present
it is just as that dear good professor van helsing said he is true grit and he improved under strain that would kill a dealer nature
he came back full of life and hope and determination
we have got everything in order for tonight
i feel myself quite wild with excitement
i suppose one ought to pity anything so hunted as the count
that is just it
this thing is not human not even a beast
to reader
seward's account of poor lucy's death and what followed is enough to dry up the springs of pity in one's heart
later
lord godalming and mr.
morris arrived earlier than as expected
dt
seward was put on business and had taken jonathan with him so i had to see them
it was to me a painful meeting for it brought back all poor dear lucy's hopes of only a few months ago
of course they had heard lucy speak of me and it seemed that dr
van helsing too had been quite' blowing my trumpet's smr
morris expressed it
poor fellows neither of them is aware that i know all about the proposals they made to lucy
they did not quite know what to say or do as they were ignorant of the amount of my knowledge
so they had to keep on neutral subjects
however i thought the matter over and came to the conclusion that the best thing i could do would be to post them on affairs right uptodate
i knew from dr
seward's diary that they had been at lucy's death her real death and that i need not fear to betray any secret before the time
so i told them as well as i could that i had read all the papers and diaries and that my husband and i having typewritten them had just finished putting them in order
i have the beach a copy to read on the library
when lord god coming to this and turned it over it does make a pretty good pile he said did you write all this mrs.
harker
in order and he went on
idon't quite see the drift of it but you people are all so good and kind and have been working so earnestly and so energetically that all i can do is to accept your ideas blindfold and try to help you
i have had one lesson already in accepting facts that should make a man humble to the last hour of his life
besides i know you loved my lucy
here he turned away and covered his face with his hands
i could hear the tears in his voice
mr
morris with instinctive delicacy just laid a hand for a moment on his shoulder and then walked quietly out of the film
i suppose there is something in a woman's nature that makes a man free to break down before her and express his feelings on the tender or emotional side without feeling it derogatory to his manhood
for when lord godalming found himself alone with me he sat down on the sofa and gave way utterly and openly
i sat down beside him and took his hand
i hope he didn't think it forward of means that if he ever thinks of it afterwards he never will have such a thought
there i wrong him
i know he never will
he is too true a gentleman
i said to him for i could see that his heart was breaking i loved dear lucy and i know what she was to you and what you were to her
she and i were like sisters and now she is gone will you not let me be like a sister to you in your trouble
i know what sorrows you have had though i can not measure the depth of them
if sympathy and pity can help in your afflictiondon't you let me be of some little service for lucy's sake
in an instant the poor dear fellow was overwhelmed with grief
it seemed to me that all that he had of late been suffering in silence found agent at once
he grew quite hysterical and raising his open hands best his palms together in a perfect agony of grief
he stood up and then sat down again and the tears rained down his cheeks
i felt an infinite pity for him and opened my arms unthinkingly
with a son he laid his head on my shoulder and cried like a wearied child whilst he shook with emotion
we women have something of the mother in us that makes us rise above smaller matters when the mother spirit is invoked
i felt this big sorrowing man's head resting on me as though it were that of a baby that someday may lie on my bosom and i stroked his hair as though he were my own child
i never thought at the time how strange it all was
after a little bit his sons ceased and he raised himself with an apology though he made no disguise of his emotion
he told me that for days and nights past weary days and sleepless not tf she has been unable to speak with anyone as a man must speak in his time of sorrow
there was no woman whose sympathy could be given to him or with whom owing to the terrible circumstance with which his sorrow was surrounded he could speak freely
i know now how i suffered he said as he cried his eyes but i do not know even her and none other ca never know how much your sweet sympathy has been to me today
i shall know better in time and believe me that though i am not ungrateful now my gratitude will grow with my understanding
you will let me be like a brother will you not for all our lives for dear lucy's sake
for dear lucy's sake i said as we clasped hands
stand for your own sake he added for if a man's esteem and gratitude are ever worth the winning you have won mine today
if ever the future should bring to you a time when you need a man's help believe me you will not call in vain
god grant that no such time may ever come to you to break the sunshine of your life but if it should ever come promise me that you will let me know
he was so earnest and his sorrow was so fresh that i felt it would comfort him so i said i promise
as i came along the corridor is a dnr
morris looking out of a window
he turned as he heard my footsteps
how i cart
he said
then noticing my red eye she went on a to see you have been comforting him
poor old fellow
he needs it
no one but a woman can help a man when he is in trouble of the heart and he had no one to comfort him
before his own trouble so bravely that my heart bled for him
i saw the manuscript in his hand and i knew that when he read it he would realize how much i knew so i said to him i wish i could comfort all who suffer from the heart
will you let me be your friend and will you come to me for comfort if you need it
you will know later why i speak
he saw that i was in earnest and stopping took my hand and raising it to his lips kissed it
it seemed but poor comfort to so brave and unselfish a soul and impulsively i bent over and kissed him
there are rose in his eyes and there was a momentary choking in his throat
he said quite calmly little girl you will never forget that true hearted kindness so long as ever you live
then he went into the study to his friend
little girl
the very words he had used to lucy and oh but he proved himself a friend
chapter dr
seward's diary september
i got home at fiveo'clock and found that godalming and morris had not only arrived but had already studied the transcript of the various diaries and letters which marker had not yet returned from his visit to the carriers' men of whom dr
hennessey had written home
mrs
harker gave us a cup of tea and i can honestly say that for the first time since i have lived in it this old house seemed like home
when we had finished mrs.
barker said dr.
seward may i ask a favour
i want to see your patient mr
renfield
do let me see him
what you have said of him in your diary interests me so much
she looked so appealing and so pretty that i could not refuse her and there was no possible reason why i should so i took her with ms
when i went into the room i told the man that a lady would like to see him to which he simply answered why
she is going through the house and wants to see everyone in it i answered
it very well he said if they come in by all means but just wait a minute till i tidy up the place
his method of tidying was peculiar he simply swallowed all the flies and spiders in the boxes before i could stop him
it was quite evident that he feared it was jealous of some interference
when he has got through his disgusting task he said cheerfully let the lady domain and sat down on the edge of his bed with his head down but with his eyelids raised so that he could see her as she entered
for a moment i thought that he might have some homicidal intent
i remembered how quiet he had been just before he attacked me in my own study and i took care to stand where i could seize him at once if he attempted to make a springs they
she came into the room with an easy gracefulness which would at once command the respect of any lunatic for easiness is one of the qualities mad people most respect
she walked over to him smiling pleasantly and held out her hand
good evening mr
renfield said she
you see i know you for dr
seward has told me if you
he made no immediate reply but eyed her all over intently with a set frown on his face
this look gave way to one of wonder which merged in doubt then to my intense astonishment he said you're not the girl the doctor wanted to marry are you
you can' the you know for she's dead
mes
harker smiled sweetly as she replied oh no
i have a husband of my own to whom i was married before i ever saw dr.
seward of heme
i am mrs.
harker
then what are you doing here
my husband and i are staying on a visit with dd
seward
thendon't stay
but why not
i thought that this style of conversation might not be pleasant to mrs.
harker any more than it was time so i joined on how did you know i wanted to marry anyone
his reply was simply contemptuous given in a pause in which he turned his eyes from mrs.
market to be instantly turning them back again what an asinine question
idon't see that at all mr
renfield said mrs.
marker at once championing me
he replied to her with as much courtesy and respect as he had shown contempt time you will of course understand mrs.
marker that when a man is so loved and honoured as our host is everything regarding him is of interest in our little community
dr
's award is loved not only by his household and his friends but even by his patients who bring some of them hardly in mental equilibrium are apt to distort causes and effects
since i myself have been an inmate of a lunatic asylum i can not but notice that the sophist is tendencies of some of its inmates lean towards the errors of non ca usa and if no ratios lens he
i positively opened my eyes at this new development
here was my own pet lunatic the most pronounced of his rule that i had ever met with talking elemental philosophy and with the manner of a polished gentleman
i wonder if it was mrs.
harker's presence which had touched some chord in his memory
if this new phase was spontaneous or in anyway due to her unconscious influence she must have some rare gift of power
we continued to talk for some time and seeing that he was seemingly quite reasonable she ventured looking at me questioningly as she began to lead him to his favourite topic
i was again astonished for he addressed himself to the question with the impartiality of the complete st. sanity
he even took himself as an example when he mentioned certain things
why i myself am an instance of a man who had a strange belief
indeed it was no wonder that my friends were alarmed and insisted on my being put under control
i used to fancy that life was a positive and perpetual entity and that by consuming a multitude of live things go matter how low in the scale of creation one might indefinitely prolong life
at times i held the belief so strongly that i actually tried to take human life
the doctor here will hear me out that on one occasion i tried to kill him for the purpose of strengthening my vital powers by the assimilation with my own body of his life through the medium of his blood relying of course upon the scriptural phrase' for the blood is the life
' though indeed the vendor of a certain nostrum has bulgaria ed the truism to the very point of contempt
isn't that true doctor
in order assent for i was so amazed that i hardly knew what form thee think or say it was hard to imagine that i had seen him eat up his spiders and flies not five minutes before
looking at my watch i saw that i should go to the station to meet van helsing so i told mrs.
marker that it was time to leave
she came at once after saying pleasantly home
benfield goodbye and i hope i may see you often under auspices pleasanter to yourself
to which to my astonishment he replied goodbye my dear
i pray god i may never see your sweet face again
maybe bless and keep you
when i went to the station to meet van helsing i left the boys behind me
poor art seemed more cheerful then he has been since lucy first took ill and quincey is more like his own bright self than he has been for many a long day
van helsing stepped from the carriage with the eager bumble bees or a boy
he saw me at once and rushed up to me saying at friend john how goes all
well
sl
i have been busy for i come here to stay if need be
all affairs are settled with me and i have much to tell
madam mina is with you
yes
and her so fine husband
and arthur and my friend quincey they are with you too
good
as i drove to the house i told him of what had passed and of how my own diary had come to be of some use through mrs.
harker's suggestion at which the professor interrupted me
at that wonderful madam mina
she has man's brains brain that a man should have we're be much gifted and a woman's heart
the good god fashioned her for a purpose believe me when he made that so good combination
friend john up to now fortune has made that woman of help to us after tonight she must not have to do with this so terrible affair
it is not good that she runs risk so great
we men are determine ebay areas not pledged to destroy this monster
but it is no part for a woman
even if she be not harmed her heart may fail her in so much and so many horrors and hereafter she may suffer both in waking from her nerves and in sleep from her dreams
and besides she is young woman and not so long married there may be other things to think of some time is not now
you tell me she has wrote all then she must consult with us but tomorrow she say goodbye to this work and we go alone
i agreed heartily with him and then i told him what we had found in his absence that the house which dracula had bought was the very next one to my own
he was amazed and a great concern seemed to come on him
oh that we had known it before
he said for then we might have reached him in time to save poor lucy
however' the milk that is split cries not out afterwards' as you say
we shall not think of that but go on our way to the end
then he fell into a silence that lasted till we entered my own gateway
before we went to prepare for dinner he said to mrs.
harker i am told madam mina by my friend john that you and your husband have put up in exact order all things that have been up to this moment
not up to this moment professor she said impulsively but up to this morning
but why not up to bow
we have seen hitherto how good light all the'll type things have made
we have told our secrets and yet no one who has told is the worse for it
mrs
market began to blush and taking a paper from her pockets she said dr.
van helsing will you read this and tell me if it must go in
it is my record of today
i too have seen the need of putting down at present everything however trivial but there is little in this except what is personal
must it goin
the professor read it over gravely and handed it back saying it need not goin if you do not wish it but i pray that it may
it can but make your husband love you the more and all us your friends more honour you as well as more esteem and love
she took it back with another blush and a bright smile
and so now up to this very hour all the records we have are complete and in order
the professor took away one copy to study at her dinner and before our meeting which is fixed for nineo'clock
the rest of us have already read everything so when we meet in the study we shall all be informed as to facts and can arrange our plan of battle with this terrible and mysterious enemy
mina harker's journal september
when we met in dr
seward's study two hours after dinner which had been at sixo'clock we unconsciously formed a sort of board or committee
professor van helsing took the head of the table to which dr
seward motioned him as he came into the room
he made me sit next to him on his right and asked me to act as secretary
jonathan sat next time
opposite us were lord godalming dr
seward and mr.
morris lord godalming being near the professor and dr
seward in the centre
the professor saudi may i suppose take it that we are all acquainted with the facts that are in these papers
we all expressed assent and he went on then it were i think good that i tell you something of the kind of enemy with which we have to deal
i shall then make known to you something of the ni story of this man which has been ascertained for me
so we then can discuss how we shall act and can take our measure according
there are such beings as vampires some of us have evidence that they exist
even had we got the proof of our own unhappy experience the teachings and the records of the past five proof enough for sane people's
i admit that at the first i was sceptic
were it not that through long years i have trained myself to keep an open mind i could not have believed until such time as that fact thunder on my ear
's ee
see
i prove i prove
' alas
hadi known at first what now i know gay had i even guess at him one so precious life had been spared to many of us who did love her
but that is gone and we must do work that other poor souls perish not whilst we can save
the nosferatu do not dislike the bee when testing once
he is only stronger and being stronger have yet more power to work evil
this vampire which is amongst us is of himself so strong in person as twenty men he is of cunning more than mortal for his cunning be the growth of age she have still the side of necromancy which is as his etymology imply the divination by the dead and all the dead that he can come night page for him at command he is brute and more than brute he is devil in callous and the heart of him is not he can within his range direct the elements the storm the for the thunder he can command all the meager things the rat and the owl and then at the moth and the epa and the wolf he can grow and become small and he can at times vanish and some unknown
how then areas to begin our strike to destroy him
how shall we find his where and having found it how can we destroy
my friends this is much it is a terrible task that we undertake and there may be consequence to make the brave shudder
for if we fail in this outright he must surely win and then where ended
life is no things i need him not
but to fail here is not mere life or death
it is that we become as him that we henceforward become foul things of the night like him without heart of conscience preying on the bodies and the souls of those we love best
to us forever are the gates of heaven shut for who shall open them to us again
we go on for all time abhorred by allan lot on the face of god's sunshine an arrow in the side of him who died for jan
but we are face to face with duty and i'm such case must we shrunk
for me i say no but then i am old and life with his sunshine his fair places his song of birds his music and his love lie far behind
you others are young
some have seen sorrow but there are fairways yet in store
what say you
whilst he was speaking jonathan had taken my hand
i feared oh so much that the appalling nature of our danger was overcoming him when i saw his hand stretch out buy it was lifetime to feel it's touch so strong so self reliant so resolute
a brave man's hand can speak for itself it does not even need a woman's love to hear it's music
when the professor had done speaking my husband looked in my eyes and i in his there was no need for speaking between us
i answer firm in a and myself he said
count me on professor said mr
quincey morris laconi daily as usual
ian with you said lord godalming for lucy's sake of corno other reason
dr
seward simply nodded
the professor stood up and after laying his golden crucifix on the table held out his hand on either side
i took his right hand and lord god aiming his left jonathan held my right with his left and stretched across home
morris
so as we all took hands our solemn compact was made
i felt my heart icy cold but it did not even occur time to draw back
we resumed our places and dr
van helsing went on with a sort of cheerfulness which showed that the serious work had begun
it was to be taken as gravely and ijaw business like a way as any other transaction of life
well you know what we have to contend against but we too are not without strength
we have on outside power of combination a power denied to the vampire kind we have sources of science we are free to act and think and the hours of the day and the night are ours equally
in fact so far as our powers extend they are unfettered and we are free to use them
we have self devotion in a cause and an end to achieve which is not a selfish one
these things are much
now let us see how far the general powers arrayed against us are restrict and how the individual can not
in fine let us consider the limitations of the vampire in general and of this one in particular
all we have to go up on are traditions and superstitions
these do not at the first appear much when the matter is one of life and death may or more than either life or death
yet must we be satisfied in the first place because we have to be no other means is a tour control and secondly because after all these things tradition and superstition are everything
does not the belief in vampire crest for others though not so as
for us on them
a year ago which of us would have received such a possibility in the midst of our scientific sceptical matter of fact nineteenth century
we even scouted a belief that we saw justified under our very eyes
take it then that the vampire and the belief in his link nations and his cure rest for the moment on the same base
for let me tell you he is known everywhere that men have been
in old greece in old time he flourish in germany all over in france in india even if the chefmoz ese and in china so far from us in all says there even is he and the peoples for him at this day
he have follow the wake of the berserker icelander the devil begotten jun the slave he was on the magyar
so far then we have all we may act upon and let me tell you that very much of the beliefs are justified by what we have seen in our own so unhappy experience
the vampire live on and can not die by mere passing of the time he can flourish when that he can fatten on the blood of the living
even more we have seen amongst us that he can even grow younger that his vital faculties grow strenuous and seem as though they refresh themselves when his special pa bulimia plenty
but he can not flourish without this did the ear not as others
even friend jonathan who lived with him for weeks did never see time at never
he throws no shadow he make in the mirror no reflect as again jonathan observe
he has the strength of many of his hand witness again jonathan when he shut the door against the wolves and when he help him from the diligence top
he can transform himself to wolf as we gather from the ship arrival in whitby when he tear open the dog he can be as far as karam mina saw him on the window at whitby and as friend john saw him fly from this so near house and as my friend quincey saw him at the window of miss lucy
he can come in most which he create that noble ship's captain proved him of this but from what we know the distance he can make this mist is limited and it can only be found himself
he come on moon light rays as elemental dist az again jonathan saw those sisters in the castle of dracula
he become so small we ourselves saw miss lucy e. re she was at peace slip through a hair breadth space at the tomb door
he's an when once he find his way come out from anything or into anything no matter how close it've found prevent used up with fire solder you call it
he can see in the dark no small power this in a world which is one half shut from the light
ah but year me through
he can do all these things yet he is not free
may he is even more prisoner than the space of the valley than the madman in his cell
he can not go where he lists he who is not of nature has yet to obey some of nature's laws why we know not
he may not enter anywhere at the first unless there become one of the household who bid him to come though afterwards he can come as he please
his power ceases as does that of all evil things at the coming of the day
only at certain times can he have limited free.com
if he be not at the place whither he is bound he can only change himself at noon or at exact sunrise or sunset
these things we are good and in this record of ours we have proof by inference
this whereas he can do as he will within his limit when he gave his earth home his coffin home his hell home the place in hallowed as we saw when he went to the grave of the suicide at whitby still at other time he can only change when the time come
it is said too that he can only pass running water at the slack of the flood of the tide
then there are things which so afflict him that he has no power as the garlic that we know of an faq for things sacred as this symbol my crucifix that was amongst us even now when we resolve to them he is nothing but in their presence he take his place far off and silent with respect
there are others too which i shall tell you of lest in our seeking we may need them
the branch of wild rose on his coffin keep him that he move not from its sacred bullet fired into the coffin kill him so that he be true dead and as for the stake through him we know already of its peace of the cutoff head that give the est
we have seen it with our eyes
thus when we find the habitation of this man that was we can combine him to his coffin and destroy him if we obey what we know
but he is clever
i have asked my friend arminius of budapest m university to make his record and from all the means that are here line of what he has been
he must indeed have been that volvo de dracula who won his name against the turk over the great river on the very frontier of turkey land
if it be so then waste no common man for in that time and for centuries after he was spoken of as the died erect and the most cunning as well as the bravest of the sons of the' land beyond the forest
' that mighty brain and that iron resolution went with him to his grave and are even now arrayed against us
the dracula's were says arminius a great and noble face though now and again were scions who were held by their vid gals to have had dealings with the evil one
they learned his secrets in the scholomance amongst the mountains over lake herman start where the devil claims the tenth scholar as his due
in the records are such words as' str who is a' witch' or dog' and' polol' satan and hell and in one manuscript this very dracula is spoken of as' d amour' which we all understand goodell
there have been from the loins of this very one great men and good women and their graves makes acres the earth where alone this foul news sandwell
for it is not the less to first errors that this evil thing is rooted deep in all good in soil barren of holy memories it can not rest
whilst they were talking mr
morris was looking steadily at the window and he now got up quietly and went out of the room
there was a little pause and then the professor went on
and now we must settle what we do
we have here much data and we must proceed to lay out our campaign
we know from the inquiry of jonathan that from the castle to whitby came to dry boxes of earth all of which were delivered at carfax we also know that at least some of these boxes have been removed
it seems to me that our first step should be to ascertain whether all the rest remain in the house beyond that wall where we look today or whether anymore have been removed
if the latter we must trace
here we were interrupted in a very startling way
outside the house came the sound of a pistol shot the glass of the window was shattered with a bullet which ricochet ring from the top of the embr a sure struck the far wall of the room
i am afraid i am at heart a coward for i shrieked out
the men all jumped to their feet lord godalming flew over to the window and threw up the sash
as he did so we heard me
morris' voice without sorry
i fear i have alarmed you
i shall come in and tell you about it
a minute later he came in and said it was an idiotic thing of me to do and i ask your pardon me s
harker most sincerely i fear i must have frightened you terribly
but the fact is that whilst the professor was talking there came a big fat and sat on the windowsill
i have got such a horror of the damned brutes from recent events that i can not stand them and i went out to have a shot as i have been doing of late of evenings whenever i have seen one
you used to laugh at me for it then art
did you hit it
asked dr.
van helsing
idon't know i fancy not for it flew away into the wood
without saying anymore he took his seat and the professor began to resume his statement
we must trace each of these boxes and when we are ready we must either capture or kill this monster in his lair or we must ao to speak sterilize the earth so that no more ye can seek safety unit
thus in the end we may find him in his form of msn between the hours of noon and sunset and so engage with him when he is at his host weak
and now for you madam mina this night is the end until all be well
you are too precious to us to have such risk
when we part tonight you no more must question
we shall tell you all in good time
we are men and are able to bear but you must be our star and our hope and we shall act all the more free that you are not in the danger such as we are
all the men even jonathan seemed relieved but it did not seem to me good that they should grave danger and perhaps lessen their safety strength being the best safety through care of me but their minds were made up and though it was a bitter pill for me to swallow i could say nothing save to accept their chivalrous care of me
mr
morris resumed the discussion as there is no time to lose i core we have a look at his house right now
time is everything with him and swift action on our part may save another victim
i own that my heart began to fail me when the time for action came so close but i did not say anything for i had a greater fear that if i appeared as a drag of a hindrance to their work they might even leave me out of the or counsel's altogether
they have now gone off to carfax with means to get into the house
jan like they had told me to go to bed and sleep as if a woman can sleep when those she loves are in danger
i shall lie down and pretend to sleep lest jonathan have added anxiety about me when he returns
dr
seward's diary october a.
h
just as we were about to leave the house an urgent message was brought to me from renfield to know if i would see him at once as he had something of the utmost importance to say home
i told the messenger to say that i would attend to his wishes in the morning i was busy just at the moment
the attendant added he seems very importunate air
i have never seen him so eager
idon't know but what if youdon''t see him soon he will have one of his violent fits
i knew the man would not have said this without some cause so i said all right i'll go now and i asked the others to wait a few minutes for me as i had to go and see my patient
take me with you friend john said the professor
his case in your diary interest me much and it had bearing to know and again on our case
i should much like to see him and especial when his mind is disturbed
may i come also
asked lord godalming
me too
said quincey morris
may icons
said harker
i nodded and we all went down the passage together
we found him in a state of considerable excitement but far more rational in his speech and manner than i had ever seen him
there was an unusual understanding of himself which was unlike anything i had ever met within a lunatic and he took it for granted that his reasons would prevail with others entirely same
we all five went into the room but none of the others at first said anything
his request was that i would at once release him from the asylum and send him home
this he backed up with arguments regarding his complete recovery and adduced his own existing sanity
i appeal to your friends he said they will perhaps not mind sitting in judgement on my case
by the way you have not introduced me
i was so much astonished that the oddness of introducing a madman in an asylum did not strike me at the moment and besides there was a certain dignity in the man's manner so much of the habit of equality that i at once made the introduction lord godalming professor van helsing mr
quincey morris of texas md
jonathan harker mr
d enfield
he shook hands with each of them saying in turn lord godalming i had the honour of seconding your father at the windham i grieve to know by your holding the title that he is no more
he was a man loved and honoured by all who knew him and in his youth was i have heard the inventor of a burnt rum punch much patronized on derby night
mr
morris you should be proud of your great state
it's reception into the union was a precedent which may have far reaching effects hereafter when the pole and the tropics may hold alliance to the stars and stripes
the power of treaty may yet prove a vast engine of enlargement when the monroe doctrine takes its true place as a political table
what shall any man way of his pleasure at meeting van helsing
siri make no apology for dropping all forms of conventional prefix
when an individual has revolutionized therapeutics by his discovery of the continuous evolution of brain matter conventional forms are in fitting since they would seem to limit him to one of a class
you gentlemen who by nationality by heredity or by the possession of natural gifts are fitted to hold your respective plexes in the moving world i take to witness that is massage as at least the majority of men who are in full possession of their liberties
and i am sure that you dr
seward humanitarian and mexico jurist as well as scientist will deem it a moral duty to deal with me as one to be considered as under exceptional circumstances
he made this last appeal with a courtly air of conviction which was not without its own charm
i think we were all staggered
for my own part i was under the conviction despite my knowledge of the man's character and history that his reason had been restored and i felt under a strong impulse to tell him that i was satisfied as to his sanity and would see about the necessary formalities for his release in the morning
i thought it better to wait however before making so grave a statement for of old i knew the sudden changes to which this l articular patient was liable
so i contented myself with making a general statement that he appeared to be in proving very rapidly that i would have a longer chat with him in the morning and would then see what i could do in the direction of meeting his wishes
this did not at all satisfy him for he said quickly but i fear dr
seward that you hardly apprehend my wish
i desire for pay once here now this very hour this very moment if i may
time presses and in our implies agreement with the old scythe man it is of the essence of the contract
i am sure it is only necessary to put before so admirable a practitioner as we
seward so simple yet so momentous a wish to ensure its fulfilment
he looked at me keenly and seeing the negative in my face turned to the others and scrutinized them closely
not meeting any sufficient response he went on is it possible that i have erred in my supposition
you have i said frankly but at the same time as i felt brutally
there was a considerable pause and then he said slowly then i suppose i must only shift my ground or request
let me ask for this concession boon privilege what you will
i am content to implore in such a case not on personal grounds but for the sake of others
iambic at liberty to give you the whole of my reasons but you may i assure you take it from me that they are good ones sound and unselfish and spring from the highest sense of duty
could you look air into my heart you would approve to the full the sentiments which animate me
nay more you would count me amongst the best and truest of your friends
again he looked at us all keenly
i had a growing conviction that this sudden change is his entire intellectual method was but yet another phase of his madness and so determined to let him go on a little longer knowing from experience that he would like all lunatics give himself away in the end
van helsing was gazing at him with a look of utmost intensity his bushy eyebrows almost meeting with the fixed concentration of his look
he said to renfield in a tone which did not surprise me at the time but only when i thought of it afterwards for it was as if one addressing an equal can you not tell frankly your real reason for wishing to be free tonight
i will undertake that if you will satisfy even me a stranger without prejudice and with the habit of keeping an open minded
seward will give you at his own risk and on his own responsibility the privilege you seek
he shook his head sadly and with a look of poignant regret on his face
the professor went on comes it be think yourself
you claim the privilege of reason in the highest degree since you seek to impress us with your complete reasonableness
you do this whose sanity we have reason to doubt since you are not yet released from medical treatment for this very defect
if you will not help us in our effort to choose the wisest course how can we perform the duty which you yourself put upon us
be wise and help us and if we can we shall aid you to achieve your wish
he still shook his head as he said dr.
van helsing i have nothing to say
your argument is complete and if i were free to speak i should not hesitate a moment but i am not my own master in the matter
i can only ask you to trust me
if i am refused the responsibility does not rest with me
i thought it was now time to end the scene which was becoming too comically grave so i went towards the door simply saying come my friends we have work to do
goodnight
as however i got near the door and a change came over the patient
he moved towards me so quickly that for the moment i feared that he was about to make another homicidal attack
my fears however were groundless for he held up his two hands imploring it and made his petition in a moving manner
as he saw that the very excess of his emotions a skill rating against him by restoring us more to our old relations he became still more demonstrative
i glanced at van helsing and saw my conviction reflected in his eyes so i became a little more fixed in my manner or not more stern and motioned to him that his efforts were unavailing
i had previously seen something of the same constantly growing excitement in him when he had to make some request of which at the time he had thought much such for instance as when he wanted a cat and i was prepared to see the collapse into the same sullen acquiescence in this occasion
my expectation was not realized for when he found that his appeal would not be successful he got into quite a frantic condition
he threw himself on his knees and held up his hands wringing them in plaintive supplication and poured forth a torrent of entreaty with the tears rolling down his cheeks and his whole face and form expressive of the deepest emotion
let me entreat you dr
seward oh let me implore you to let me out of this house at once
send me away how you will and where you will send keepers with me with whips and chains let them take me in a strait waistcoat manacles and let ironed event of all but let me go out of this
youdon''t know what you do by keeping me here
i am speaking from the depths of my heart of my very soul
youdon''t know whom you wrong or how and i may not tell
works me
i may not tell
by all you hold sacred by all you hold dear by your love that is lost by your hope that lives for the sake of the almighty take me out of this and save my soul from guilt
can't you hear me man
can't you understand
will you never learn
don't you know that i am sane and earnest now that i am no lunatic in a made it but a sane man fighting for his soul
oh hear me
hear me
let me to let me good the go
i thought that the longer this went on the wilder he would get and so would bring on a bit so i took him by the hand and raised him up
coke i said sternly no more of this we have had quite enough already
get to your bed and try to behave more discreetly
he suddenly stopped and looked at me intently for several moments
then without a word he rose and moving over sat down on the side of the bed
the collapse had come as informed occasions just as i had expected
when i was leaving the room last of our party he said to me in a quiet well bred voice you will i trustee
seward done the justice to bear in mind later on that i did what i could to convince you tonight
chapter jonathan harker's your nai october a.
m
i went with the party to the search with an easy mind for i think i never saw monaco absolutely strong and well
i am so glad that she consented to hold back and let us men so the work
somehow it was a dread to me that she was in this fearful business at all but now that her work is done and that it is due to her energy and brains and foresight that the whole story is put together in such a way that every point tells she may well feel that her part is finished and that she can henceforth leave the rest to us
we were i think all a little upset by the scene with me
renfield
when we came away from his room we were silent hill we got back to the study
the nmr
morris said todd
seward say jackie that man wasn't attempting a bluff he is about the same st. lunatic i ever saw
i'm not sure but i believe that he had some serious purpose and if he had it was pretty rough on him not to get a chance
lord godalming and i were silent but dr
van helsing added friend john you know more lunatics than i do and i'm glad if it for i fear that if it had been to me to decide i would before that last hysterical outburst have given him free
but we live and learn and in our present task we must take no chance as my friend quincey would say
all is best as they are
dr
seward seemed to answer them both in a dreamy kind of day idon't know but that i agree with you
if that man had been an ordinary lunatic i would have taken my chance of trusting him but he seems so mixed up with the count in an index y kind of way that i am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his face
i can' t forget how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a vat and then tried to hear my throat out with his teeth
besides he called the count' lord and master' and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way
that horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him so i suppose heisn'ta give trying to use a respectable lunatic
he certainly did seem earnest though
i only hope we have done what is best
these things in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand help to unnerve a man
the professor stepped over and laying his hand on his shoulder said in his grave kindly way friend john have no fear
we are trying to do our duty in a very sad and terrible case we can only do as we deem best
what else have ew to hope for except the pity of the good god
lord godalming had slipped away for a few minutes but now he returned
he held up a little silver whistles she remarked that old place may be full of rats and if so i've got an antidote on call
having passed the wall we took our way to the house taking care to keep in the shadows of the trees on the lawn when the moon light shone out
when we got to the porch the professor opened his bag and took out a lot of things which he laid on the step sorting them into four little groups evidently one for each
then he spoke
my friends we are going into a terrible danger and we need arms of many kinds
our enemy is not merely spiritual
remember that he has the strength of twenty men and that though our necks of our windpipe care of the common kind and therefore breakable or crushable his are not amenable to mere strength
a stronger manor a body of kenmore strong in all than him can at certain times hold him but they can not hurt him as we can be hurt by him
we must therefore guard ourselves from his touch
keep this next your heart
as he spoke he lifted a little silver crucifix and held it out to me i being nearest to him out these flowers round your neck here he handed to me a wreath of withered garlic blossoms for other enemies more mundane this revolver and this knife and for aid in all these so small electric lamps which you can fasten to your breast and for all and above all at the lady this which we must not desecrate needless
this was a portion of sacred water which he put in an envelope and handed to me
each of the others was similarly equipped
now he said friend john where are the skeleton key s
if so that we can open the door we need not break house by the window as before at miss lucy's
dr
seward tried one or two skeleton key show mechanical dexterity as a surgeon standing him in good stead
presently he got one to suit after a little playback and forward the bolt yielded and with a rusty clang shot back
we pressed on the door the rusty tin he screamed and it slowly opened
it was startlingly like the image conveyed to meiner
seward's diary of the opening of miss westenra's tomb i fancy that the same idea seemed to strike the others for with one accord they shrank back
the professor was the first to move forward and stepped into the open door
ibm a must has domine
he said crossing himself as he passed over the threshold
we closed the door behind us lest when we should have put our lamps we should possibly attract attention from the road
the professor carefully tried the lock lest we might not be able to open it from within should we be in a hurry making our exit
then we all out our lamps and proceeded on our search
the light from the tiny lamps fell in all sorts of odd forms as the rays crossed each other or the opacity of our bodies three great shadows
i could not for my life get away from the feeling that there was someone else amongst us
i suppose it was there collection so powerfully brought home to me by the grim surroundings of that terrible experience in transylvania
i think the feeling was common to us all for i noticed that the others kept looking over their shoulders at every sound and every new shadow just as i felt myself doing
the whole place was thick with dust
the floor was seemingly inches deep except where there were recent footsteps in which in holding down my lamp i could see marks of non nails where the dust was cracked
the walls were fluffy and heavy with dust and in the corners were masses of spider's web's where on the dust had gathered till they looked like old tattered ears as the weight had torn then partly down
on a table in the hall was a great bunch of keys with a time yellowed label on each
they had been used several times for on the table were several similar rents in the blanket of dust similar to that exposed when the professor lifted them
he turned to me and said you know this place jonathan
you have copied maps of it and you know it at least more than we do
which is the way to the chapel
i had an idea of its direction though on my former visit i had not been able to get admission to its oiled the way and after a few wrong turnings found myself opposite all watched oaken door ribbed with iron bands
this is the spot said the professor as he turned his lamp on a small map of the house copied from the file of my original correspondence regarding the purchase
with a little trouble we found the key on the bunch and opened the door
we were prepared for some unpleasantness for as we were opening the door again t malodorous air seemed to exhale through the gaps but none of us ever expected such an odour as we encountered
none of the others had met the count at all at close quarters and when i had seen him he was either in the tasting stage of his existence in his rooms or when he was bloated with fresh blood in a ruined building open to the air but here the place was small and close and the long disuse had made the air stagnant and foul
there was an earthy smell as of some dry miasma which came through the boiler air
but as to the odour itself how shall i describe it
it was not alone that it was composed of all the ills of mortality and with the pungent acrid smell of blood but it seemed as though corruption has become itself corrupt
faith
it sickens me to think of it
every breath exhaled by that monster seemed to have clung to the place and intensified its loathsome news
under ordinary circumstances such a stench would have brought our enterprise to amend but this was no ordinary case and the high and terrible purpose in which we were involved gave us a strength which rose above merely physical considers to its
after the involuntary shrinking consequent on the first nauseous white as one and all set about our work as though that loathsome place were a garden of roses
we made an accurate examination of the place the processor saying as we began the first thing is to see how many of the boxes are left we must then examine every hole and corner and cranny and see if we can not get some clue as to what has become of the rest
a glance was sufficient to show how many remained for the great earth chests were bulky and there was no mistaking the m
there were only twenty nine left out of the fifty
once i got a bright for seeing lord godalming suddenly turn and look out of the vaulted door into the dark passage beyond i looked too and for an instant my heart stood still
somewhere looking out from the shadow i seemed to see the highlights of the count's evil face the ridge of the hose the red eyes there skips the awful pallor
it was only for a moment bodas lord godalming said i thought i saw a face but it was only the shadows and resumed his inquiry i turned my lamp in the direction and stepped into the passage
there was no sign of any one and as there were no corners no doors no aperture of any kind but only the solid walls of the passage there could be no hiding place even for him
i took it that fear had helped imagination and said nothing
a few minutes later i saw morris step suddenly back from a corner which he was examining
we all followed his movements with our eyes for undoubtedly some nervousness was growing on us and we saw a whole mass of phosphorescence which twinkled like stars
we all instinctively drew back
the whole place was becoming a live with rats
for a moment or two we stood appalled all save lord godalming who was seemingly prepared for such an emergency
rushing over to the great ironbound oaken door which dr
seward had described from the outside and which i had seen myself he turned the key in the lock drew the huge bolts and swung the door open
then taking his little silver whistle from his pocket he blew a low shrill call
it was answered from behind dr
seward's house by the helping of dogs and after about a minute there terriers cameras king found the corner of the house
unconsciously we had all moved towards the door and as we moved i noticed that the dust had been much disturbed
the boxes which had been taken out had been brought this way
but even in the minute that had elapsed the number of the rats had vastly increased
they seemed to swarm over the place all at once till the lamp light shining on their moving dark bodies and glittering baleful eyes made the place look like a bank of earth set with fireflies
the dogs dashed on but at the threshold suddenly stopped and snarled and then simultaneously lifting their noses began to howl in most lugubrious fashion
the rats were multiplying in thousands and we moved out
lord godalming lifted one of the dogs and carrying him in placed him on the floor
the instant his feet touched the ground he seemed to recover his courage and rushed at his natural enemies
they fled before him so fast that before he had shaken the life out of a score the other dogs who had by now been lifted in the same manner had but small pre here the whole mass had vanished
with their going it seemed as if some evil presence had departed for the dogs frisked about and barked merrily as they made sudden darts at their prostrate toss and turned them over and over and tossed them in the air with vicious shakes
we all seemed to find our spirits rise
whether it was the purifying of the deadly atmosphere by the opening of the chapel door of the relief which we experienced by finding ourselves in the open i know not but most certainly the shadow of dread seemed to slip from us like a robe and the occasion of our coming lost something of its brim significance though we did not slacken a whit in our resolution
we closed the outer door and barred and locked it and bringing the dogs with us began our search of the house
we found nothing throughout except dustin extraordinary proportions and all untouched save for my own footsteps when i had made my first visit
never once did the dogs exhibit any symptom of uneasiness and even when we returned to the chapel they frisked about as though they had been rabbit hunting in a summer wood
the morning was quickening in the east when we emerged from the front
dr
van helsing had taken the key of the hall door from the bunch and locked the door in orthodox fashion putting the key into his pocket when he had done
so far he said our night has been eminently successful
no harm has come to us such as i feared might be and yet we have ascertained how many boxes are missing
more than all do i rejoice that this our first and perhaps our most difficult and dangerous step has been accomplished without the bringing the're into our most sweet madam mon apr troubling her as long or sleeping thoughts with sights and sounds and smells of horror which she might never forget
one lesson too we have learned if it be allowable to argue a particular i that the brute beasts which are to the count's command are yet themselves not amenable to his spiritual power for look these rats that would come to his call just as from his castle top be summon the wolves to your going and to that poor mother's cry though they come to him they run pell help from the so little dogs of my friend arthur
we have other matters before us other dangers of her fears and that monster
he has not used his power over the bruce world for the only of the last time tonight
albeit that he has gone elsewhere
good
it has given us opportunity to cry' check' in some ways in this chess game which we play for the stake of human souls
and now let us go home
the dawn is closest hand and we have reason to be content with our first night's work
it may be ordained that we have many nights and ways to follow if full of peril but we must go on and from no danger shall we shrink
the house was silent when we got back save for some poor creature who was screaming away in one of the distant safe send a low moaning sound from renfield's room
the poor wretch was doubtless torturing himself after the manner of the insane with needless thoughts of pain
i came tip toe into our own room and found mona asleep breathing so softly that i had to put my ear down to hear it
she looks paler than usual
i hope the meeting tonight has not upset her
i am truly thankful that she is to be left out of our future work and even of our deliberations
it is too great as train for a woman to bear
i did not think so at first but i know better now
therefore i am glad that it is settled
there maybe things which would frighten her to hear and yet to conceal them from her might be worse than to tell her if once she suspected that there was any concealment
henceforth our work is to be a sealed book to her till at least such time as we can tell her that all is finished and the earth free from a monster of the netherworld
i dare say it will be difficult to begin to keep silence after such confidence as ours but i must be resolute and tomorrow i shall keep dark over tonight's doings and shall refuse to speak of anything that has happened
i rest on the sofa so as not to disturb her
october later
i suppose it was natural that we should have all overslept ourselves for the day was a busy one and the night had not eat at all
even mina must have felt it's exhaustion for though i slept till the sun was high i was awake before her and had to call two or three times before she awoke
indeed she was so sound asleep that for a few seconds she did not recognize me but looked at me with a sort of blank terror as one looks who has been wales out of a bad dream
she complained a little of being tired and lost her rest till later in the day
we now know of twenty one boxes having been removed and if it be that several were taken in any of these removals we may be able to trace the mall
such will of course immensely simplify our labor and the sooner the matter is attended to the better
i shall lookup thomas snelling today
dr
seward's diary october
it was towards noon when i was awakened by the professor walking into my room
he was more jolly and cheerful than usual and it is quite evident that last night's work has helped to take some of the brooding weight off his mind
after going over the adventure of the night he suddenly said your patient interest and much
may it be that with you i do with on this morning
or if that you are too occupy i can go alone if it may be
it is a new experience to me to find a lunatic who talk philosophy and reason so sound
i had some work to do which pressed so i told him that if he would go alone i would be glad we then i should not have to keep him waiting so i called an attendant and gave him the necessary instructions
before the professor left the room i cautioned him against getting any false impression from my patient
but he answered i want him to talk of himself and of his delusion as to consuming live things
he said to madam min was used in your diary of yesterday that he had once had such a belief
why do you smile friend john
excuse me i said but the answer is here
i laid my hand on the typewritten matter
when our sage and learned lunatic made that very statement of how he used to consume life his mouth was actually nauseous with the flies and spiders which he had eaten just before mrs.
harker entered the room
van helsing smiled in turn
good
he said
your memory is true friend john
i should have remembered
and yet it is this very obliquity of thought and memory which makes mental disease such a fascinating study
perhaps i may gain more knowledge out of the folly of this madman than i shall from the teaching of the most wise
who knows
i went on with my work and before long was through that in hand
it seemed that the time had been very short indeed but there was van helsing back in the study
do i interrupt
he asked politely as he stood at the door
not at all i answered
come in
my work is finished and i am free
i can go with to know if you like
it is needless i have seen him
well
i fear that he does not appraise meat much
our interview was short
when i entered his room he was sitting on a stool in the centre with his elbows on his knees and his face was the picture of sullen discontent
i spoke to him as cheerfully as i could and with such a measure of respect as i could assume
he made no reply whatever
'don't you know me
' i asked
his answer was not reassuring' i know you well enough you are the old fool van helsing
i wish you would take yourself and your idiotic brain theories somewhere else
damn all thick headed dutchmen
' not a word more would he say but satin his implacable sullen nec was indifferent to me as though i had not been in the room at all
this departed for this time my chance of much learning from this so clever lunatic so i shall go if i may and cheer myself with a few happy words with that sweet soul madam mina
friend john it does rejoice me unspeakable that she is no more to be pained no more to be worried with our terrible things
though we shall much miss her help it is better so
i agree with you with all my heart i answered earnestly for i did not want him to weaken in this matter
mrs
marker is better out of it
things are quite bad enough for us all men of the world and who have been in many tight places in our time but it is no place for a woman and if she had remained in touch with the affair it would in time infallibly have wrecked her
so van helsing has gone to confer with mrs.
market and market quincey and art are all out following up the clues as to the earth boxes
i shall finish my round of work and we shall meet tonight
mina harker's journal october
it is strange to me to be kept in the dark as i am today after jonathan's full confidence for so many years to see him manifestly avoid certain matters and those the most vital of all
this morning i slept late after the fatigues of yesterday and though jonathan was late to one was the earlier
he spoke to me before he went out never more sweetly or tenderly but he never mentioned a word of what had happened in the visit to the court's house
and yet he must have known how terribly anxious i was
poor dear fellow
i suppose it must have distressed him even more than it did me
they all agreed that it was best that i should not be drawn further into this awful work and i acquiesced
but to think that he keeps anything from me
and now i am crying like a silly cool when i know it comes from my husband's great love and from the good good wishes of those other strong men
that has done is good
well someday jonathan will tell me all
and lest it should ever be that he should think for a moment that i kept anything from him i still keep my journal as usual
then if he had feared of my trust i shall show it to human g h every thought of my heart put down for his dead eyes to read
i feel strangely sad and low spirited today
i suppose it is the reaction from the terrible excitement
last night i went to bed when the men had gone simply because they told me to
i didn't feel sleepy and i did feel full of devouring anxiety
i kept thinking over everything that has been ever since jonathan came to see me in london and it all seems like a horrible tragedy with fate pressing on relentlessly to come destined end
everything that one does seems no matter how right if may be to bring on the very thing which is most to be deplored
if ihavn't gone to whitby perhaps poor dear lucy would be with us now
shehavn't taken to visiting the churchyard till i came and if shehavn't come there in the daytime with me shewouldn't have walked in her sleep
and if shehavn't gone there at night and asleep that monstercouldn't have destroyed her as he did
oh why did i ever go to whitby
there now crying again
i wonder what has come over me today
i must hide it from jonathan for if he knew that i had been crying twice in one morning
i who never cried on my own account and whom he has never caused to end date at the dear fellow would feet his heart out
i shall put a bold face on and if i do feel weepy he shall never see it
is to lose it is just one of the lessons that we poor women have to learn
ican't quite remember how i fell asleep last night
i remember hearing the sudden barking of the dogs and a lot of queer sounds like praying on a very tumultuous scale from me
renfield's room which is somewhere under this
and then there was silence over everything silence so profound that it startled me and i got up and looked out of the window
all was dark and silent the black shadows thrown by the moonlight seeking full of a silent mystery of their own
not a thing seemed to be stirring but all to be grit and fixed as death of fate so that a thin stream of white mist that crept with almost imperceptible slowness across the grass towards the house seemed to have a sentience and a vitality of its own
i think that the digression of my thoughts must have done me good for when i got back to bed i found a lethargy creeping over me
i lay a while but could not quite sleep so i got out and looked out of the window again
the mist was spreading and was now close up to the house so that i could see it lying thick against the dallas though it were stealing up to the windows
the poor man was more loud than ever and though i could not distinguish a word he said i could in some way recognize in histones some passionate entreaty on his part
then there was the sound of a struggle and i knew that the attendants were dealing with him
i was so frightened that i crept into bed and pulled the clothes over my head putting my fingers in my ears
i was not the habit sleepy at least so i thought but i must have fallen asleep for except dreams i do not remember anything until the morning when jonathan woke me
i think that it took me an effort and a little time to realize where i was and that it was jonathan who was bending over me
my dream was very peculiar and was almost typical of the way that waking thoughts become merged in or continued in dreams
i thought that i was asleep and waiting for jonathan to come back
i was very anxious about him and i was powerless to act my feet and my hands and my brain were weighted so that nothing could proceed at the usual pads
and so i slept in easily and thought
then it began to dawn upon me that the air was heavy and dank and cios
i put back the clothes from my face and found to my surprise that all was dim around
the gas light which i had left out for jonathan but turned down came only like a tiny red spark through the fog which had evidently grown thicker and poured into the room
then it occurred to me that i had shut the window before i had come to bed
i would have got out to make certain on the point but some leaden lethargy seemed to chain my limbs and even my will
i lay still and ensures that was all
i closed my eyes but would still see through my eyelids
it is wonderful what tricks our dreams playus and how conveniently we can imagine
the most grew thicker and thicker and i could see no show it came in for i could see it like smoke or with the white energy of boiling water pouring in. not through the window but through the joining's of the door
it got thicker and thicker till it seemed as if it became concentrated into a sort of pillar of cloud in the room through the top of which i could see the light of the gas shining like a red eye
things began to whirl through my brain just as the cloudy column was now whirling in the room and through it all came the scriptural words a pillar of cloud by day and of fire by night
was it indeed such spiritual guidance that was coming home in my sleep
but the pillar was composed of both the day and the night guiding for the fire was in the red eye which at the thought got a new fascination for me till as i looked the fire divided and seemed to shine on me through the fog like two red eyes such as lucy told me of inter momentary mental wandering when on the cliff the dying sunlight struck the windows of st
mary's church
suddenly the horror burst upon me that it was thus that jonathan had seen those awful women growing into reality through the whirling mist in the moonlight and in my dream i must have fainted for all became black darkness
the last conscious effort which imagination made was to show me a livid white face bending over me out of the mist
i must be careful of such dreams for they would unseat one's reason if there were too much of them
i would get dr
van helsing or dr
seward to prescribe something for me which would make me sleep only that i fear to alarm them
such a dream at the present time would become woven into their fears for me
tonight i shall strive hard to sleep naturally
if i do not i shall tomorrow night get them to give me a dose of chloral that can not hurt me for once and it will give me a good night's sleep
last night tired be more than if i had not slept at all

last night i slept but did not dream
i must have slept soundly for i was not asked by jonathan coming to be shut the sleep has not refreshed me for today i feel terribly weak and spiritless
i spent all yesterday trying to read or lying down dozing
in the afternoon mr
renfield asked if he might see me
poor man he was very gentle and when i came away he kissed my hand and base god bless me
some way it affected me much
i am crying when i think of him
this is a new weakness of which i must be careful
jonathan would be miserable if he knew i had been crying
he and the others were out till dinner time and they all came into red
i did what i could to brighten the hip and i suppose that the effort did me good for i forgot how to reviews
after dinner they sent me to bed and all went off to smoke together as they said but i knew that they wanted to tell each other of what had occurred to each during the day
i could see from jonathan's manner that he had something important to communicate
i was not so sleepy as i should have been so before they went i asked dr.
seward to give me a little opiate of some kind as i had not slept well the night before
he very kindly made me up a sleeping draught which he gave to me telling me that it would come no harm as it was very mild
i have taken it and am waiting for sleep which still keeps all of
i hope i have not done wrong for as sleep begins to flirt with me a new fear comes that i may have been foolish in thus depriving myself of the power of waking
i might want it
here comes sleep
goodnight
chapter jonathan g. adler's journal october evening
i found thomas snelling in his house at bethnal green but unhappily he was not in a condition to remember anything
the very prospect of beer which my expected coming had opened to him had proved too much and he had begun too early on his expected debauch
i learned however from his wife who seemed a decent poor soul that he was only the assistant of skillet who of the two mates was the responsible person
so off i drove to walworth and found me
joseph s. miller at home and in his shirt sleeves taking a late tea out of a saucer
he is a decent intelligent fellow distinctly a good reliable type of workman and with a head piece of his own
he remembered all about the incident of the boxes and from a wonderful do geared notebook which reproduced from some mysterious receptacle about the seat of his trousers and which had hieroglyphic al entries in thick na of obliterated pencil he gave me the destinations if the boxes
there were he said six in the cart load which he took from carfax and left at chicks and street mile end newtown and another six which he deposited at jamaica lane bermondsey
if then the count meant to scatter these ghastly refuges of his over london these places were chosen as the first of delivery so that later he might distribute more fully
the systematic manner in which this was done made me think that he could not mean to confine himself to two sides of london
he was now fixed on the far east on the northern shore on the east of the southern shore and on the south
the north and west were surely never meant to be left out of his diabolical scheme let alone the city itself and the very heart of fashionable london in the southwest and west
i went back to skillet and asked him if he could tell us if any other boxes had been taken from carfax
he replied well t u v' not you've treated me very'sj'aime i had given him half a sovereign am i'll tell her all i know
i heard a man by the name of blox am say four nights ago in the' are an'' ounce in pincher's alley as' owns an' his mate'as'ad a rare dusty job in alld' oh seat purfleet
thereain'ta many such jobs as this' dream' i'm thinkin' that may be sam blix am could tell yes i mm hg
i asked if he could tell me where to find him
i told him that if he could get me the address it would be worth another half sovereign to him
some gulped down the rest of his tea and stood up saying that he was going to begin the search the hand there
at the door he stopped and saidlook'd reg u v' nor there ain't no sense in new keepin' you're e
i may find sam soon or i mayn't but anyhow braun' t like to be in a way to tell ye much tonight
sam is a rare one when he starts on the booze
if you can give me a envelope with a sea moon it and put her address on it i'll find out where sam is to be found and post it yet knight
but he'd better be up after' i'm so on in the mornin' nevermind the booze the night store
this was all practical so one of the children went off with a penny to buy an envelope and a sheet of paper and to keep the change
when she came back j addressed the envelope and stamped it and when s. miller has again faithfully promised to post the address when found i took my way to home
we're on the track anyhow
i am tired tonight and i want to sleep
mina is fast asleep and looks a little too pale
her eyes look as though she had been crying
poor dear i've no doubt it frets her to be kept in the dark and it may make her doubly anxious about me and the others
but it is best as it is
it is better to be disappointed and worried in such a day now than to have her nerve broken
the doctors were quite right to insist on her being kept out of this dreadful business
i must be firm for on me this particular burden of silence must rest
i shall not ever enter on the subject with her under any circumstances
indeed it may not be a hard task after all for she herself has become reticent on the subject and has not spoken of the count of his doings ever since we told her of our decision
october evening along and trying and exciting day
by the first post i got my directed envelope with a dirty scrap of paper enclosed on which was written with a carpenter's pencil in a sprawling hands am blox am i orleans love escort barrel street walworth
arch for the depots
i got the letter in bed and rose without waking mina
she looked heavy and sleepy and pale and far from well
i determined not to wake her but that when i should return from this new search i would arrange for her going back to exeter
i think she would be happier in our own home with her daily tasks to inter rather than in being here amongst us and in ignorance
i only saw dr.
seward for a moment and told him where i was off to promising to come back and tell the rest so soon as i should have found out anything
i drove to walworth and found with some difficulty potter's court
mr
s. miller's spelling misled me as i asked for poter's court instead of potter's court
however when i had found the court i had no difficulty in discovering corcoran's lodging house
when i asked the man who came to the door for the depot she shook his head and said i dunno' in
the drain' t no such a person' ere
i never' ears of' i'm in all my bloomin' days
don't believe there ain't nobody of that kind livin'' error anywhere s
i took out who i let's letter and as i read it it seemed to me that the lesson of the spelling of the name of the court might guide me
what are you
i asked
i'm the deputy he answered
i saw at once that i was on the right track
phonetic spelling had again misled me
a half drown tip put the deputy's knowledge at my disposal and i learned that mr.
bloc am who had slept off the remains of his beer on the previous night at corcoran's had left for his work at poplar at fiveo'clock that morning
he could not tell me where the place of work was situated but he had a vague idea that it was some kind of a new fangled wars' us and with this slender clue i had to start for poplar
it was twelveo'clock before i got any satisfactory tint of such a building and thus i got at a coffee shop where some workmen were having their dinner
one of them suggested that there was being erected at criss angel street a new cold storage building and as this suited the condition of a new fannie weard' uso at once drove to it
an interview with a surly gatekeeper and as uglier foreman both of whom were appeased with the coin of the realm put me on the track of blox am
he was sent for on my suggestion that i was willing to pay his days wages to his foreman for the privilege of asking him a few questions on a private matter
he was a smart enough fellow though rough of speech and bearing
when i had promised to pay for misinformation and given him an earnest he told me that he had made two journeys between carfax and a house in piccadilly and had taken from this house to the latter nine great boxes main heavy ones with a horse and cart hired by him for this purpose
i asked him if he could tell me the number of the house in piccadilly to which he replied well t u v' nor i forgot's the number but it was only a few door from a big white church or some think of the kind not long built
it was a dusty old' i use too though nothin' to the dust in ess of the' ouse we hooked the bloomin' boxes from
how did you get in. if both houses were empty
there was the old party what engaged me a waitin' in the' i use at purfleet
he's lord me to lift the boxes and put them in the fray
curse me but he was the strongest chap i ever struck an' homail d. geller with a white moustache one that thin you would think hecouldn't throw a shaffer
how this phrase thrilled through me
why'd took up' i sent o' the boxes like they was pounds of tea and me a puffin' an's blowin' afore i could upend mins anyhow an' i'm no chicken neither
how did you get into the house on piccadilly
i asked
he was there too
he just's started off and got there adore me for when i rung of the bell heisman' opened the door' is self an'' el led me carry the board into the' all
the whole nine
i asked
his there was five in the first load an' four in the second
it was main dry fork an' idon't so we'll remember' ow i got' ome
i interrupted him were the boxes left in the hall
tue it was a big' allan' there was nothin' else in it
i made one more attempt to further matters
you didn't have any key
never used nokey not nothin k
the old rent he opened the door' is self an' shut it again when i'd rub off
idon't remember the last time but that was the beer
and youcan't remember the number of the house
no sir
by the needn't have no difficulty about that
it'sa' ogg' in with a stone front with a bow on iran'' ign steps up to the door
i know them steps's vin'' as to carry the boxes up with three posters what come round to earn a copper
the old rent give them chillin's an' they seein' they got so much they wanted more
but'd took one of them by the shoulder and was like to throw' i'm down the steps till the lot of them went away dissin'
i thought that with those escription i could find the house so having paid my friend for misinformation i started off for piccadilly
i had gained a new painful experience
the count could it was evident handle the earth boxes himself
if so time was previous for now that he had achieved a certain amount of distribution he could by choosing his own time complete the task unobserved
at piccadilly circus i discharged my cab and walked westward
beyond the junior constitutional i came across the house described and was satisfied that this was the next of the pairs arranged by dracula
the house looked as though it had been long in tenanted
the windows were encrusted with dust and the shutters were up
all the framework was black with time and from their on the paint had mostly scaler away
it was evident that up to lately there had been a large notice board in front of the balcony
it had how ever been roughly torn away the uprights which had supported it still remaining
behind the rails of the balcony i saw there were some loose boards whose raw edges looked white
i would have given a good deal to have been able to see the notice board intact as it would perhaps have given some clue to the ownership of the house
i remembered my experience of the investigation and purchase of carfax and i could not but feel that if i could find the former owner there might be some means discovered of gaining access to the house
there was atp recent nothing to be learned from the piccadilly side and nothing could be done so i went around to the back to see if anything could be gathered from this quarter
the jews were active the piccadilly houses being mostly in occupation
i asked one or two of the grooms and helpers whom i saw around if they could tell me anything about the empty house
one of them said that he heard it had lately been taken by thecouldn't say from whom
he told me however that up to very lately there had been a notice board of for sale up and that perhaps mitchell sons candy the house agents could tell me something as he thought he remembered seeing the name of that firm on the board
i did not wish to seem to leave for to let my informant know or guess too much so thanking him in the usual manner i strolled away
it was now growing dusk and the autumn night was closing in so i did not lose any time
having learned the address of mitchell sons candy from a directory at the berkeley i was soon at their office in sackville street
the gentleman who saw me was particularly suave in manner but uncommunicative in equal proportion
having once told me that the piccadilly house which throughout our interview he called a mansion was sold be considered my business as concluded
when i asked who had purchased it he opened his eyes a thought wider and paused a few seconds before replying it is cold air
pardon me i said with equal politeness but i have a special reason for wishing to know who purchased it
again he paused longer and raised his eyebrows still more
it is sold sir was again his laconic reply
surely i said you do not mind letting me know so much
but i do mind he answered
the affairs of their clients are absolutely safe in the hands of mitchell sons candy
this was manifestly sprig of the first water and there was no use arguing with him
i thought i had best meet him on his own ground so i said your clients air are happy in having so resolute a guardian of their confidence
i am myself a professional man
here i handed him my card
in this instance i am not prompted by curiosity i act on the part of lord godalming who wishes to know something of the property which was he understood lately for sale
these words put a different complexion on affairs
he said i would like to oblige you if i couldnt
marker and especially would i like to oblige his lordship
we once carried out a small matter of getting some chambers for him when he was the honourable arthur holywood
if you will let me have his lordship's address i will consult the house on the subject and will in any case communicate with his lordship by tonight's post
it will be a pleasure if we can so far deviate from our rules as to give the required information to his lordship
i wanted to secure a friend and not to make an enemy so i thanked him have the address ater
seward's and came away
it was now dark and i was tired and hungry
i got a cup of tea at the aerated bread company and came down to purfleet by the next train
i found all the others at home
nina was looking tired and pale but she made a valiant effort to be bright and cheerful
it wrung my heart to think that i had had to keep anything from her and so caused her in quietude
thank god this will be the last night other looking on a tour conferences and feeling the sting of our not showing our confidence
it took all my courage to hold to the wise resolution of keeping her out of our from task
she seems somehow more reconciled or else the very subject seems to have become repugnant to her for when any accidental allusion is made she actually shudders
i am glad we made our resolution in time as with such a feeling as this our growing knowledge would be torture to her
i could not tell the others of the day's discovery till we were alone so after dinner followed by a little music to save appearances even amongst ourselves i took mins to her room and left her to go to bed
the dead girl was more affectionate with me than ever and clung to me as though she would retain me but there was much to be talked of and i came away
thank god the ceasing of telling things has made no difference between us
when i came down again i found the others all gathered round the fire in the study
in the train i had written my diary so far and simply read it off to them as the best means of letting them get abreast of my own information
when i had finished van helsing said this has been a great day's work friend jonathan
doubtless we are on the track of the missing boxes
if we find them all in that house then our work is near the end
but if there be some missing we must search until we find them
then shall we make our final coup and hunt the wretch to his real death
we all sat silent awhile and all at once mr
morris spoke say
how are we going to get into that house
we got into the other answered lord godalming quickly
buy art this is different
we broke house at carfax but we had night and a walled park to protect us
it will be a mighty different thing to commit burglary in piccadilly either by day or night
i confess idon't see how we are going to get in unless that agency duck can find us a key of some sort
lord godalming's brows contracted and he stood up and walked about the room
by and by he stopped and said turning from one to another of us quincey's head is level
this burglary business is getting serious
we got off once all right but we have now a rare job on hand
unless we can find the count's key basket
as nothing could well be done before morning and as it would be at least advisable to wait till lord godalming should hear from mitchell's we decided not to take any active step before breakfast time
for a good while we war and smoked discussing the matter in its various lights and bearings
i took the opportunity of bringing this diary right up to the moment
i am very sleepy and shall not over
just a line
mina sleeps soundly and her breathing is regular
her forehead is puckered up into little wrinkles as though she thinks even in her sleep
she is still too pale but does not look so haggard as she did this morning
tomorrow will i hope kendall this
she will be herself at home in exeter
oh but i am sleepy
dr
seward's diary october
i am puzzled a fresh about renfield
his moods change so rapidly that i find it difficult to keep touch of them and as they always mean something more than his own wellbeing they form a more than interesting study
this morning when i went to see him after his repulse of van helsing his manner was that of a man commanding destiny
he was in fact commanding destiny subjectively
he did not really care for any of the things of mere earth he was in the clouds and looked down on all the weaknesses and wants of us poor mortals
i thought i would improve the occasion and learn something so i asked him what about the flies these times
he smiled on me in quite a superior sort of way such a smile as would have become the face of malvolio as he answered me the fly my dear sir has one striking feature
its wings are typical of the aerial powers of the psychic faculties
the ancients did well when they typified the soul as a butterfly
i thought i would push his analogy to its utmost logically so i said quickly on it is a soul you are after now is it
his madness filled his reason and a puzzled look spread over his face as shaking his head with a decision which i had but seldom seen in him
he said oh no oh no
i want no souls
life is all i want
here he brightened up
i am pretty indifferent about it at present
life is all eight
i have all i want
you must get a new patient doctor if you wish to study zippy any
this puzzled me a little so i drew him on
then you command life
you are a god i suppose
he smiled with any need a boy benign superiority
oh no
f arbeit from me to arrogate to myself the attributes of the deity
i am not even concerned in his especially spiritual doings
if i may state my intellectual position i am so far as concerns things purely terrestrial somewhat in the position which enoch occupied spiritually
this was a power to me
i could not at the moment recall enoch's apposite ness so i had to ask a simple question though i felt that by codling i was lowering myself in the eyes of the lunatic
and why with enoch
because he walked with god
i could not see the analogy but did not like to admit it so i marked back to what he had denied
so youdon''t care about life and youdon''t want souls
why not
i put my question quickly and somewhat sternly on purpose to die concert him
the effort succeeded for an instant he unconsciously relapsed into his old sergipe manner bent low before he and actually dawned upon me as he replies
idon't want any souls indeed indeed
idon't
icouldn't use them if i had them
they would be no manner of use to me
i couldn're at the mir
he suddenly stopped and the old cunning look spread over his face like a wind sweep on the surface of the water
and doctor as to life what is it after all
when you've got all you require and you know that you will never want that is all
i have friends good friends like you dr
seward
this was said with a peer of inexpressible cunning
i know that i shall never lack the means of life
i think that through the cloudiness of his insanity he saw some antagonism in me for me at once fell back on the last refuge of such as new dogged silence
after a short time i saw that for the present it was useless to speak to him
he was silky and so i came away
later in the day he sent for me
ordinarily i would not have come without special reason but just at present i am so interested in him that i would gladly make an effort
besides i am glad to have anything to help pass the time
marker is out following up clues and so are lord godalming and quincey
van helsing sits in my study poring over the record prepared by the markers
he seems to think that by accurate knowledge of all details he will light upon some clue
he does not wish to be disturbed in the work without cause
i would have taken him with me to see the patient only i thought that after his last repulse he might not care to go again
there was also another reason
renfield might not speak so freely before a third person as when he and i were alone
i found him sitting in the middle of the floor on his stool a pose which is generally indicative of some mental energy on his part
when i came in. he said at once as though the question had been waiting on his lips
what about souls
it was evident then that my surmise had been correct
unconscious were bration was doing it's work even with the lunatic
i determined to have the matter out
what about them yourself
i asked
he did not reply for a moment but looked all around him and up and down as though he expected to find some inspiration for an answer
idon't want any souls
he said in a feeble apologetic way
the matter seemed preying on his mind and so i determined to use it to be cruel only to be kind
so i said you like life and you want life
oh yes
but that is allright
you need n' t worry about that
but i asked how are we to get the life without getting the soul also
this seemed to puzzle him so i followed it up a nice time you'll have some time when you're flying out here with the souls of thousands of flies and spiders and birds and cats buzzing and twittering and moaning all around you
you've got their lives you know and you must put up with their souls
something seemed to affect his imagination for he put his fingers to his ears and shut his eyes screwing them up tightly just as a small blue led when his face is being soaped
there was something pathetic in it that touched me
it also be bfme a lesson for it seemed that before he was a child only a child though the features were worn and the stubble of the jaws was white
it was evident that he was undergoing some process of mental disturbance and knowing how his past moods has interpreted things seemingly foreign to himself i thought i would enter into his mind as well as i could and go with him
the first step was to restore confidence so i asked him speaking pretty loud so that he would hear me through his closed ears would you like some sugar to get your flies around again
he seemed to wake up all at once and shook his head
with a laugh he replied not much
flies are poor things after all
after a pause he added but idon't want their souls buzzing sound me all the same
or spiders
i went on
blow spiders
what's the use of spiders
thereisn'ta my thing in them to eat or
he stopped suddenly as though reminded of a forbidden topic
also
i thought to myself this is the second time he has suddenly stopped at the word' drink'
what does it mean
renfield seemed himself aware of having made a lapse for he hurried on as though to distract my attention from it idon't take any stock at all in such matters
' rats and mice and such small deer' as shakespeare has it' chicken feed of the ladder' they might be called
i'm past all that sort of nonsense
you might as well ask a man to eat molecules with a pair of chopsticks as to try to interest me about the less carnivora when i know of what is before me
i see issue
you want big things that you can make your teeth meet in
how would you like to breakfast on an elephant
what ridiculous nonsense you are talking
he was getting too wide awake so i thought i would press him hard
i wonder i said reflectively what an elephant's soul is like
the effect i desired was obtained for me at once tell from his high horse and became a child again
idon't want an elephant's soul or any soul at all
he said
for a few moments he sat despondent ly
suddenly he jumped to his feet with his eyes blazing and all the signs of intense cerebral excitement
to help with you and your souls
he shouted
why do you plague me about souls
haven'ti not enough to worry and pain to distract me already without thinking of souls
he looked so hostile that i thought he was in for another homicidal fit so i blew my whistle
the instant however that i did so he became calm and said apologetically forgive me doctor
i forgot myself
you do not need any help
i am so worried in my mind that i am apt to be irritable
if you only knew the problem i have to face and that i am working out you would pity and tolerate and pardon me
pray do not put me in a strait waistcoat
i want to think and i can not think freely when my body is confined
i am sure you will understand
he had evidently self control so when the attendants came i told them not to mind and they withdrew
renfield watched them to
when the door was closed he said with considerable dignity and sweetness dr
seward you have been very considerate towards me
believe me that i am very very grateful to you
i thought it well to leave him in this mood and so i came away
there is certainly something to ponder over in this man's state
several points seem to make what the american interviewer calls a story in one could only get them in proper order
here they are will not mention drinking
fears the thought of being burdened with the soul of anything
has no dread of wanting life in the future
despises the meager forms of life altogether though he breads being haunted by their souls
logically all these things point one way
he has assurance of some kind that he will acquire some higher life
he'd reads the consequence the burden of a soul
then it is a human life he looks to
and the assurance
merciful god
the count has been to him and there is some new scheme offer for a foot
later
i went after my found to van helsing and told him my suspicion
he grew very grave and after thinking the matter over for awhile asked me to take him to renfield
i did so
as we came to the door we heard the lunatic within singing gaily as he used to do in the time which now seems so long ago
when we entered we saw with amazement that he had spread out his sugar as of old
the flies lethargic with the autumn were beginning to buzz into the room
we tried to make him talk of the subject of our previous conversation but he would not attend
he went on with his singing just as though we had not been present
he had got a scrap of paper and was folding it into a notebook
we had to come away as ignorant as we went in
his is a curious case indeed
we must watch him tonight

seward's diary october
i placed a man in the corridor last night and told him to make an accurate note of any sound he might hear from renfield's room and gave him instructions that if there should be anything strange he was to call me
after dinner when we had all gathered round the fire in the study mrs.
harker having gone to bed we discussed the attempts and discoveries of the day
harmer was the only one who had any result and we are in great hopes that his clue may be an important one
before going to bed i went round to the patient's room and looked in through the observation trap
he was sleeping soundly his heart rose and fell with regular respiration
this morning the man on duty be ported to be that a little after midnight he was restless and kept saying his prayers somewhat likely
i asked him if that was all
he replied that it was all he heard
there was something about his manner so suspicious that i asked him point blank if he had been asleep
he denied sleep but admitted to having dozed for awhile
it is too bad that men can not be trusted unless they are watches
today marker is out following up his clue and art and quincey are looking after horses
godalming thinks that it will be well to have horses always in readiness for when we get the information which we seek there will be no time to lose
we must sterilise all the imported earth between sunrise and sunset
we shall thus catch the counts this weakest and without a refuge to fly to
van helsing is off to the british museum looking up some authorities on ancient medicine
the old physicians took account of things which their followers do not accept and the professor is searching for witch and demon cures which may be useful to us oster
i sometimes think we must be all mad and that we shall wake to sanity in strait waistcoats
later
we have met again
we seem a toast to be on the track and our work of tomorrow may be the beginning of the end
i wonder if renfield's quiet has anything to do with this
his moods have so followed the doings of the count that the coming destruction of the monster may be carried to him some subtle way
if we could only get some hint as to what passed in his mind between the time of my argument with him today and his resumption of fly catching it might afford us a valuable clue
he is now seemingly quiet for aspell
iste
that wild tell seemed to come from his room
the attendant came bursting into my room and told me that renfield had somehow met with some accident
he had heard him yell and when he went to him found him lying on his face on the floor all covered with blood
i must go at once
chapter dr
seward's diary october
let me put down with exactness all that happened as well as i can remember since last i have an entry
not a detail that i can recall must be forgotten
in all calmness i must proceed
when i came to renfield's room i found him lying on the floor on his left side in a glittering pool of blood
when i went to move him it became at once apparent that he had received some terrible injuries
there seemed none of the unity of purpose between the parts of the body which marks even lethargic sanity
as the face was exposed i could see that it was horribly bruised as though it had been beaten against the floor
indeed it was from the face wounds that the pool of blood originated
the attendant who was kneeling beside the body said to me as we turned him over i think sir his back is broken
see both his right arm and leg and the whole side of his face are paralyzed
how such a thing could have happened puzzled the attendant beyond measure
he seemed quite bewildered and his brows were gathered in as he said ican't understand the two things
he could mark his face like that by beating his own head on the floor
i saw a young woman do it once at the ever's field asylum before anyone could lay hands on her
and i suppose he might have broken his neck by falling out of bed if he got in an awkward link
but for the life of me ican't imagine how the two things occurred
if his back was broke hecouldn't beat his head and if his face was like that before the fall out of bed there would be marks of it
i said to him go to dr
van helsing and ask him to kindly come here at once
i want him without an instant's delay
the man ran off and within a few minutes the processor in his dressing gown and slippers appeared
when he saw renfield on the ground he looked keenly at him a moment and then turned to me
i think he recognized my thought in my eyes for he said very quietly manifestly for the ears of the attendant at a car accident
he will need very careful watching and much attention
i shall stay with you myself but i shall first dress myself
if you will remain i shall in a few minutes join you
the patient was now breathing's terror lucky and it was easy to see that he had suffered some terrible injury
van helsing returned with extraordinary celerity bearing with him a surgical case
he had evidently been thinking and had his mind made up for almost before he looked at the patient he whispered to me send the attendant away
we must be alone with him when he becomes conscious after the operation
i said i think that will do now simmons
we have done all that we can at present
you had better to your round and dr
van helsing will operate
let me know instantly if there be anything unusual anywhere
the man withdrew and we went into a strict examination of the patient
the wounds of the face were superficial
the real injury was a depressed fracture of the skull extending right up through the motor area
the professor thought a moment and said we must reduce the pressure and get back to normal conditions as far as can be
the rapidity of the diffusion shows the terrible nature of his injury
the whole motor area seems affected
the cut fusion of the brain will increase quickly so we must tre phone at once or it may be too late
as he was speaking there was a soft tapping at the door
i went over and opened it and found in the corridor without arthur and quincey in pajamas and slippers the former spoke i heard your man call up dr.
van helsing and tell him of an accident
so i woke quincey or rather called for him as he was not asleep
things are moving too quickly and too strangely for sound sleep for any of us these times
i've been thinking that tomorrow night will not see things as they have been
we'll have to look back and forward a little more than we have done
may we come in
i nodded and held the door open till they had entered then i closed it again
when quincey saw the attitude and state of the patient and noted the horrible pool on the floor he said softly my god
what has happened to him
poor poor devil
i told him briefly and added that we expected he would recover consciousness after the operation for a short time at all events
he went at once and sat down on the edge of the bed with godalming beside him
we all watched in patience
we shall wait said van helsing just long enough to fix the best spot for treo mining so that we may most quickly and perfectly remove the blood clot for it is evident that the haemorrhage is increasing
the minutes during which we waited passed with fearful slowness
i had a horrible sinking in my heart and from van helsing's face i gathered that he felt some fear of apprehension as to what was to come
i dreaded the words renfield might speak
i was positively afraid to think
but the conviction of what was coming was on me as i have read of men who have heard the death watch
the poor man's breathing came in uncertain gasps
each instant he seemed as though he would open his eyes and speak but then would follow a prolonged sheet proud breath and he would relapse into a more fixed in sensibility
inured as i was to sick beds and death this suspense grew and grew up on me
i could almost hear the beating of my own heart and the blood surging through my temples sounded like blows from a hammer
the silence finally became agonizing
i looked at my companions one after another and saw from their flushed face same day of rows that they were ensuring equal torture
there was a nervous suspense over us all as though overhead some dread bell would leak out powerfully when we should least expect it
at last there came a time when it was evident that the patient was sinking fast
he might die at any moment
i looked up at the professor and caught his eyes fixed on mine
his face was sternly set as he spoke there is no time to lose
his words may be worth many lives
i have been thinking so as i stood here
it may be there is a soul at stake
we shall operate just above the ear
without another word he made the operation
for a few moments the breathing continued to best error ous
then there came a breath so prolonged that it seemed as though it would tear open his chest
suddenly his eyes opened and became fixed in a wild helpless's rare
this was continued for a few moments then it was softened into a glad surprise and from his lips came a sigh of relief
he moved convulsively and as he did so said i'll be quiet doctor
tell them to take off the strait waistcoat
i have had a terrible dream and it has left me so weak that i can not move
what's wrong with my face
it feels all swollen and it smarts dreadfully
he tried to turn his head but even with the effort his eyes seemed to grow glassy again so i gently put it back
then van helsing said in a quiet grave to me tell us your dream mr
renfield
as he heard the voice his face brightened through its mutilation and he said that is dr.
van helsing
how good it is if you to be here
give me some water my lips are dry and i shall try to tell you
i dreamed
he stopped and seemed fainting
i called quietly to quincey the brandy it is in my study quick
he flew and returned with a glass the decanter of brandy and as a raft of water
we moistened the parched lips and the patient quickly revived
it seemed however that his poor injured brain had been working in the interval for when he was quite conscious he looked at me piercing it with an agonized confusion which i shall never forget and said i must not deceive myself
it was no dream but all a grim reality
then his eyes rover round the room
as they caught sight of the two figures sitting patiently on the edge of the bed he went on if i were not sure already i would know from them
for an instant his eyes closed not with pain or sleep but voluntarily as though he were bringing all his faculties to beat
when he opened them he said hurriedly and with more energy than he had yet displayed quick doctor quick i am dying
i feel that i have but a few minutes and then i must go back to death or worse
wet my lips with brandy again
i have something that i must say before i die
or before my poor brushed brain does anyhow
thank you
it was that night after you left me when i implored you to let me go away
icouldn't speak then for i felt my tongue was tied
but i was ass and then except in that way as i am now
i was in an agony of despair for a long time after you left me it seemed hours
then there came a sudden peacetime
my brain seemed to become cool again and i realized where i was
i heard the dogs bark behind our house but not where he was
as he spoke van helsing's eyes never blinked but his hand came out and get mine and gripped it hard
he did not however betray himself
he nodded slightly and said to only a low voice
renfield proceeded
he came up to the window in the most as i had seen him often before but he was solid then got a ghost and his eyes were fierce like a man's when angry
he was laughing with his red mouth the sharp white teeth glinted in the moonlight when he turned to look back over the belt of trees to where the dogs were barking
iwouldn't ask him to come in at first though i knew he wanted to just as he had wanted all along
then he began promising me things not in words but by doing them
he was interrupted by a word from the professor how
by making them happen
just as he used to send in the flies when the sun was shining
great big fat ones with steel and sapphire on their wings
and big moths in the night with skull and crossbones on their backs
van helsing nodded to him as he whispered to me unconsciously the acheron to a atropos of the sp hinges what you call the' death's head high'
the patient went on without stopping then he began to whisper
' rats rats rats
hundreds thousands millions of them and everyone alive
and dogs to eat them and data top
all lines
all red blood with tears of life in it and not merely buzzing flyer
' i laughed at him for i wanted to see what he could do
then the dog show led away beyond the dark trees in his house
he beckoned me to the window
i got up and looked out and he raised his hands and seemed to call out without using any words
a dark mass spread over the grass coming on like the shape of a flame of fire
and then he moved the most to the right and left and i could see that there were thousands of rats with their eyes blazing red like his only smaller
he held up his hand and they all stopped and i thought he seemed to be saying' all these lives will i give you stand many more and greater through countless ages if you will fall down and worship me
' and then a red cloud like the colour of blood seemed to close over my eyes and before i knew what i was doing i found myself opening the sash and saying to him' come in lord and master
' the rats were all gone but he slid into the room through the cash though it was only open an inch wide just as the moon herself has often come in through the tiniest crack and has stood before me in all her size and spie broke
his voice was weaker so i'm listened his lips with the brandy again and he continued but it seemed as though his memory had gone on working in the interval for his story was further advanced
i was about to call him back to the point but van helsing whispered to me let him go on
do not interrupt him
he can not go back and maybe could not proceed at all of once he lost the thread of his thought
he proceeded all day i waited to hear from him but he did not send me anything not even a blow fly and when the moon got up i was pretty angry with him
when he did slide in through the window though it was shut and did not even knock i got mad with him
he sneered at me and his white face looked out of the most with his red eyes gleaming and he went on as though he owned the whole place and i was no one
he didn't even smell the same as he went by me
icouldn't hold him
i thought that somehow mrs.
harker had come into the room
the two men sitting on the bed stood up and came over standing behind him so that he could not see them but where they could hear better
they were both silent but the professor started and quivered
his face however tree trimmer and sterner still
renfield went on without noticing when mrs.
harker came into see me this afternoon she wasn't the same
it was like tea after the teapot has been watered
here we all moved but no one said a word
he went on i didn't know that she was here till she spoke and she didn't look the same
idon't care for the pale people
i like them with lots of blood in the man where all seemed to have run out
i didn't think of it at the time but when she went away i began to think and it made me mad to know that he has been taking the life out of her
i could feel that the rest shivered as i did but we remained otherwise still
so when he came tonight i was ready for him
i saw the most stealing in and i grabbed it right
i had heard that madmen have unnatural strength
and as i knew i was a madman at times anyhow i resolved to use my power
ay and he felt it too for he had to come out of the most to struggle with me
i held tight and i thought i was going to win for i didn't mean him to take any more of her life till i saw his eyes
they burned into me and my strength became like water
he slipped through it and when i tried to cling to him he raised me up and flung me down
there was a red cloud before me and a noise like thunder and the most seemed to steal away under the door
his voice was becoming fainter and his breath more at error ous
van helsing stood up instinctively
we know the worst now he said
he is here and we know his purpose
it may not be too late
let us be armed the same as we were the other night but lose no time there is not an instant to spare
there was no need to put out bear gay our conviction into words we shared them in common
we all hurried and took from our rooms the same things that we had when we entered the count's house
the professor had his reach and as we met in the corridor he pointed to them significantly as he said they never leave me and they shall not till this unhappy business is over
be wise also my friends
it is no common enemy that we deal with spas
alas
that dear madam mina should suffer
he stopped his voice was breaking and i do not know if rate of terror predominated in my own heart
outside the markers' door we paused
art and quincey held back and the latter said should we disturb her
we must said van helsing grimly
if the door be locked i shall break it in
may it not frighten her terribly
it is unusual to break into a lady's room
van helsing said solemnly you are always right
but this is life and death
all chambers are alike to the doctor
and even were they not they are all as one time tonight
friend john when i turn the handle of the door does not open do you put your shoulder down and shove and you too my friends
now
he turned the handle as he spoke but the door did not yield
we threw ourselves against it
with a crash it burst open and we almost fell headlong into the room
the professor did actually fall and i saw across him as he gathered himself up from hands and knees
what i was appalled me
i felt my hair rise like bristles on the back of my neck and my heart seemed to standstill
the moonlight was so bright that through the thick yellow blind the room was light enough to see
on the bed beside the window lay jonathan harker his face flushed and breathing heavily as though in a stupor
kneeling on the near edge of the bed facing outward's was the white clad figure of his wife
by her side stood at all thin man clad in black
his face was turned from us but the instant we saw we all recognized the count in every way even to the scar on his forehead
with his left hand he held both hrs
harker's hands keeping them away with her arms at full tension
his right hand gripped her by the back of the neck forcing her face down on his bosom
her white night dress was smeared with blood and a thin stream trickled down the man's bare chest which was shown by his torn open dress
the attitude of the two had a terrible resemblance to a child forcing a kitten's nose into a saucer of milk to compel it to drink
as we burst into the room the count turned his face and the hellish look that i had heard described seemed to leap into it
his eyes flamed red with devilish passion
the great nostrils of the white aquiline nose opened wide and quivered at the edge and the white sharp teeth behind the full lips of the blood dripping mouth clamped together like those of a wild beast
with a wrench which threw his victim back upon the bed as though hurled from a height he turned and sprang arts
but by this time the professor had gained his feet and was holding towards him the envelope which contained the sacred water
the count suddenly stopped just as poor lucy had done outside the tomb and cowered back
further and further back he cowered as we lifting our crucifixes advanced
the moonlight suddenly failed as a great black cloud sailed across the sky
and when the gas light sprang up under quincey's match we saw nothing but a faint vapour
this as we looked trailer under the door which with the recoil from its bursting open had swung back to its old position
van helsing art and i moved forward to mrs.
harker who by this time had drawn her breath and with it had given a scream so wild so ear piercing so despairing that it seems to me now that it will ring in my ear still my dying day
for a few seconds she lay in her helpless attitude and disarray
her face was ghastly with a pallor which was accentuated by the blood which smeared her lips and cheeks and chin
from her throat trickled a thin stream of blood
her eyes were mad with terror
then she put before her face her poor crushed hands which bore on their whiteness the red mark of the count's terrible grip and from behind them came a low desolate wall which made the terrible scream seem only the quick expression of an endless grief
van helsing stepped forward and drew the cover key gently over her body whilst art after looking at her face for an instant despairingly ran out of the room
van helsing whispered to me jonathan is in a stupor such as we know the vampire can produce
we can do nothing with poor madam mins for a few moments till she recovers herself
i must wake him
he dipped the end of a towel in cold water and with it began to click him on the face his wife all the while holding her face between her hands and sobbing in a way that was heartbreaking to hear
i raised the blind and looked out of the window
there was much moonshine and as i looked i could see quincey morris run across the lawn and hide himself in the shadow of a great yew tree
it puzzled me to think why he was doing this
but at the instant i heard harker's quick exclamation as he woke to partial consciousness and turned to the bed
on his face as there might well he was a look of wild amazement
he seemed dazed for a few seconds and then full consciousness seemed to burst upon him all at once and he started up
his wife was aroused by the quick movement and turned to him with her arms stretched out as though to embrace him
instantly however she drew them in again and putting her elbows to get new held her hands before her face and shuddered till the bed beneath her shook
in god's name what does this mean
harker cried out
dr
seward dr
van helsing what is it
what has happened
what is wrong
mina dear what is it
what does that blood mean
my god my god
has it come to this
and raising himself to his knees he beat his hands wildly together
good god help us
help her
oh help her
with a quick movement he jumped from her and began to pull on his clothes all the man in him awake at the need for instant exertion
what has happened
tell me all about it
he cried without pausing
dr
van helsing you live mona i know
oh do something to save her
it can not have gone too far yet
guard her while i look for him
his wife through her terror and horror and distress saw some sure danger to him
instantly forgetting her own grief she seized hold of him and cried out
no
no
jonathan you must not leave me
i have suffered enough tonight god knows without the dread of his harming you
you must stay with me
stay with these friends who will watch over you
her expression became frantic as she spoke
and he yielding to her she pulled him down sitting on the bedside and clung to him fiercely
van helsing and i tried to calm them both
the professor held up his golden crucifix and said with wonderful calmness do not fear my dear
we are here and whilst this is close to you no foul things an approach
you are safe for tonight and we must be calm and take counsel together
she shuddered and was silent holding down her head on her husband's breast
when she raised it his white night ride was stained with blood where her lips had touched and where the thin open wound in the neck had sent forth drops
the instant she saw it she drew back with a low wall and whispered amidst choking sons
uncle an unclean
i must touch him or kiss him no more
oh that it should be that it is i who am now his worst enemy and whom he may have most cause to fear
to this he spoke out resolutely nonsense mina
it is a shame to me to hear such a word
i would not hear it if you
and i shall not hear it from you
may god judgement my deserts and punish me with more bitter suffering than even this hour if by any actor will of nine anything ever come between us
he put out his arms and folded her to his breast
and for a while she lay there sobbing
he looked at us over her bowed head with eyes that blinked family above his quivering nostrils
his mouth was set as steel
after a while her sobs became less frequent and more faint and then he said to me speaking with a studies calmness which i felt tried his nervous power to the utmost
and now dr
seward tell me all about it
too well i know the broadcast
tell me all that has been
i told him exactly what had happened and he listened with seeming impassive news but his nostrils twitched and his eyes glazed as i told how the ruthless hands of the count had held his wife in that terrible and horror position with her mouth to the open wound in his breast
it interested me even at that moment to see that whilst the face of white set passion worked convulsively over the bowed head the hands tenderly and lovingly stroked the ruffled hair
just as i had finished quincey and godalming knocked at the door
they entered in obedience to our summons
van helsing looked at me questioningly
i understood him to mean if we were to take advantage of their coming to divert if possible the thoughts of the unhappy husband and wife from eachother and from themselves
soon nodding acquiescence to him he asked them what they had seen or done
to which lots godalming answered
i could not see him anywhere in the passage or in any of our rooms
i looked in the study but though he has been there he had gone
he had however
he stopped suddenly looking at the poor dropping figure on the bed
van helsing said gravely go on friend arthur
we want here no more concealment s
our hope now is in knowing all
tell freely
so art went on he had been there and though it could only have been for a few seconds he made rare may of the place
all the manuscript has been burned and the blue flames were flickering among at the white ashes
the cylinders of your phonograph too were thrown on the fire and the wax had helped the flames
here i interrupted
thank god there is the other copy in the safe
his face lit for a moment but fell again as he went on
i ran downstairs then but could see no sign of him
i looked into renfield's room but there was no trace there except
again he paused
go on said market hoarsely
so he bowed his head and moistening his lips with his tongue added except that the poor fellow is dead
mrs
hawker raised her head looking from one to the other of us she said solemnly god's will be done
i could not but feel that art was keeping back something
but as i took it that it was with a purpose i said nothing
van helsing turned to morris and asked and you friend quincey have you any hotell
a little he answered
it may be much eventually but at present ican't say
i thought it well to know if possible where the count would go when he left the house
i did not see him but i saw what rise from renfield's window and flap westward
i expected to see him in some shape go back to carfax but he evidently sought some other lair
he will not be back tonight for the sky is reddening in the east and the dawn is close
we must work tomorrow
he said the latter words through his shut teeth
for a space or perhaps a couple of minutes there was silence and i could fancy that i could hear the sound of our hearts beating
then van helsing said placing his hand tenderly on mrs.
harker's head and now madam'm in a poor dear dear madam mina tell us exactly what happened
god knows that i do not want that you be pained but it is need that we know all
for now more than ever had all work to be done quick and sharp and in deadly earnest
the way is close to us that must end all of it may be so and now is the chance that we may live and learn
the poor dear lady shivered and i could see the tension of her nerves as she clasped her husband closer to her and bent her head lower and lower still on his breast
then she raised her head proudly and held out one hand to van helsing who took it in his and after stopping and kidding it reverently held it fast
the other hand was locked in that of her husband who held his other sri thrown round her protecting ly
after a pause in which she was evidently ordering her thoughts she began
i took the sleeping draught which you had so kindly given me but for a long time it did not act
i seemed to become more wakeful and myriads of horrible fancies began to crowd in upon my mind
all of them connected with death and vampires with blood and pain and trouble
her husband involuntarily groaned as she turned to him and said lovingly do not fret dear
you must be brave and strong and help me through the horrible task
if you only knew what an effort it is to me to tell of this fearful thing at all you would understand how much i need your help
well i saw i must try to help the medicine to its work with my will if it was to come any good so i resolutely set myself to sleep
sure enough sleep must soon have come to me for i remember no more
jonathan coming in. had not asked me for he lay by my side when next i remember
there was in the room the same thin white mist that i had before notices
but i forget now if you know of this
you will find it in my diary which i shall show you later
i felt the same vague terror which had come to me before and the same sense of some presence
i turned to wake jonathan but found that he slept so soundly that it seemed as if it was he who had taken the sleeping draught and not i
i tried but i could not wake him
this caused me a great fear and i looked around terrified
then indeed my heart sank within me
beside the bed as if he had stepped out of the mist or rather as of the most had turned into his figure for it had entirely disappeared stood at all thin man all in black
i knew him at once from the description of the others
the waxen face the high aquiline nose on which the light fell in a thin white line the parted red lips with the sharp white teeth showing between and the red eyes that i had seemed to see in the sunset on the windows of st
mary's church at whitby
i knew you the red scar on his forehead where jonathan had struck him
for an instant my heart stood still and i would have screamed out only that i was paralyzed
in the pause he spoke in a sort of keen cutting whisper pointing as he spoke to jonathan
' silence
if you make a sound i shall take him and wash his brains out before your very eyes
' i was appalled and was too bewildered to do i'd say anything
with a mocking smile he placed one hand upon my shoulder and holding me tight bared my throat with the other saying as he does o' first a little refreshment to reward my exertions
you may as well be quiet
it is not the first time of the second that your veins have appeased my thirst
' i was bewildered and strangely enough i did not want to hinder him
i suppose it is a part of the horrible curse that such is when his touch is on his victim
and oh my god my god pity me
he placed his feeling lips upon my throat
her husband groaned again
she clasped his hand harder and looked at him putting it as if he were the injured one and went on
i felt my strength fading away and i was in a half swoon
how long this horrible thing lasted i know not but it seemed that a long time must have passed before he took his foul awful sneering mouth away
i saw it drip with the fresh blood
the remembrance seemed for awhile to overpower her and she drooped and would have sunk down but for her husband's sustaining arm
with a great effort she recovered herself and went on
then he spoke to me mockingly' and so you like the others would play your brains against mine
you would help these msn to hunt me and frustrate me in my design
you know now and they know in part already and will know in full before long what it is to cross my path
they should have kept their energies for use closer to home
whilst they played wits against me against me who commanded nations and intrigued for them and fought for them hundreds of years before they were born i was so undermining the m
and you their best be loved one are now to me flesh of my flesh blood of my blood kin of my kinky bountiful wine press for awhile and shall be later on my companion and my helper
you shall be avenged in turn for not one of them but shall minister to your needs
but as yet you are to be punished for what you have done
you have aided in the art in the
now you shall come to my call
when my brain says come
to you you shall crossland or sea to do my bidding
and to that end this
' with that he pulled open his shirt and with his long sharp nails opened a vein in his breast
when the blood began to spur to urge took my hands on one of his holding them tight and with the other seized my neck and pressed my mouth to the sound so that i must either suffocate or swallow come to the
oh my god
my god
what have is one
what have i done to deserve such a datei who have tried to walk in meekness and righteousness all my days
god pity me
look down on a poor soul in worse than mortal peril
and in mercy port those to whom she is dead
then she began to rub her lips as though to cleanse them from pollution
as she was telling her terrible story the eastern sky began to quicken and everything became more and more clear
hacker was still and quiet but over his face as the awful narrative went on came a grey look which deepened and deepened in the morning light bill when the first red streak of the coming dawn shot up the flesh stood darkly out against the whitening hair
we have arranged that one of us is to stay with inc. all of the unhappy pair till we can meet together and arrange about taking action
of this i am sure
the sun rises today on no more miserable house in all the great round of its daily course
chapter jonathan harker's journal october
as i must do something or tomasi write this diary
it is now sixo'clock and we are to meet in the study in half an hour and take something to eat for dr
van helsing and dr
seward are agrees that if we do not eat we can not work our best
our best will be god knows required today
i must keep writing at every chance for i dare not stop to think
all big and little must go down
perhaps at the end the little things may teach us most
the teaching big or little could not have landed mon apr me anywhere worse than we are today
however we must trust and hope
poornima told me just now with the years running down her dear cheeks that it is in trouble and trial that our faith is tested
that we must keep on trusting and that god will aid us up to the end
the end
oh my god
what end
to work
to work
when dr.
van helsing and dr
seward had come back from seeing poor renfield we went gravely into what was to be done
first dr
seward told us that when he and dr
van helsing had gone down to the room below they had found renfield lying on the floor all in a heap
his face was all bruised and crushed in and the bones of the neck were broken
dr
seward asked the attendant who was on duty in the passage if he had heard anything
he said that he had been sitting down he confessed to half dozing when he heard loud voices in the room and then renfield had called out loudly several times god
god
god
after that there was a sound of falling and when he entered the room he found him lying on the floor face down just as the doctors had seen him
van helsing asked if he had heard voices of a voice and he said he could not say
that at first it had seemed to him as if there were two but as there was no one in the room it could have been only one
he could swear to it it requires that the word god was spoken by the patient
dr
edward said to us when we were alone that he did not wish to go into the matter
the question of an inquest had to be considered and it would never do to put forward the truth as no one would believe it
as it was he thought that on the attendant's evidence he could give a certificate of death by his adventure in falling from bed
in case the coroner should demand it there would be a formal inquest necessarily to the same result
when the question began to be discussed as to what should be our next step the very first thing we decided was that mina should be in full confidence
that nothing of any sort no matter how painful should be kept from her
she herself agreed as to its wisdom and it was pitiful to see her so brave and yet so sorrowful and in such a depth of despair
there must be no concealment she said
alas
we have had too much already
and besides there is nothing in all the world that can give me more pain than i have already endured than i suffer now
whatever may tx plan it must be of new hope or of new courage time
van helsing was looking after fixedly as she spoke and said suddenly but quiet it but dear madam mina are you not afraid
not for yourself but for others from yourself after what has happened
her face grew set in its lines but her eyes shone with the devotion of a martyr as she answered at no
for my mind is made up
to what
he asked gently whilst we were all very still for each in our own way we had a sort of vague idea of what she meant
her answer came with direct simplicity as though she was simply stating a fact because if i find in myself and i shall watch keenly for its sign of harm to abt that i love i shall die
you would not kill yourself
he asked hoarsely
i would
if there were no friend who loved me who would save me such a pain and so desperate an effort
she looked at him meaning it as she spoke
he was sitting down but now he rose and came close to her and put his hand on her head as he said solemnly
my child there is such an one of it were for your good
for myself i could hold it in my account with god to find such an euthanasia for you even at this moment if it were best
nay were it safe
but my child
for a moment he seemed choked and a great son rose in his throat
he gulped it down and went on there are here some who would stand between you and death
you must not die
you must not die by any hand but least of all your own
until the other who has fouled your sweet life is true dead you must not die
for if he is still with the quick undead your death would make you even as he is
no you must live
you must struggle and strive to live though death would seem a boon unspeakable
you must fight death himself though he come to you in pain or in joy
by the day of the night in safety or in peril
on your living soul i charge you that you do not die
may not think of death toll this great evil be past
the poor dear grew white as death and shook and shivered as i have seen a quicksand shake and shiver at the incoming of the tide
we were all client
we could do nothing
at length she grew more calm and turning to him said sweetly but oh so sorrowfully as she held out her hand i promise you my dear friend that if god will let me love i shall strive to do so
till if it may be in his good time this horror may have passed away from me
she was so good and brave that we all felt that our hearts were strengthened to work and endure for her and we began to discuss what we were to do
i told her that she was to have all the papers in the safe and all the papers or diaries and phonographs we might hereafter use and was to keep the record as she had done before
she was pleased with the prospect of anything to do it pleases could be used in connection with so grim an interest
as usual van helsing had thought ahead of everyone else and was prepared with an exact ordering of our work
it is perhaps well he said that at our meeting after our visit to carfax we decided not to do anything with the earth boxes that lay there
hades done so the count must have guessed our purpose and would doubtless have taken measures in advance to frustrate such an effort with regard to the others
buy now he does not know our intentions
nay more in all probability he does not know that such a power exists to us as can sterilize his pairs so that he can not use them as of old
we are now so much further advances in our knowledge as to their disposition that when we have examined the house in piccadilly we may track the very last of them
today then is ours and in it rests our hope
the sun that rose of our sorrow this morning guards us in its course
until it sets tonight that monster must retain whatever form he now has
he is confined within the limitations of his earthly envelope
he can not melt into thin air not disappear through cracks of chunks of crannies
if he go through a doorway he must open the door like a mortal
and so we have this way to hunt out all his lakes and sterilize the m
so we shall if we have not yet catch him and destroy him drive him to bay in someplace where the catching and the destroying shall be in time sure
here i started up for i could not contain myself at the thought that the minutes and seconds so previously laden with mina's life and happiness were flying from us since whilst we talked action was impossible
but van helsing held up his hand warning ly
may friend jonathan he said in this the quickest way home is the longest day so your proverbs at
we shall all act and act with desperate quick when the time has come
but think in all probable the key of the situation is in that house in piccadilly
the count may have many houses which he has bought
of them he will have deeds of purchase keys and other things
he will have paper that he wrote on
he will have his book of cheques
there are many belongings that he must have somewhere
why not in this place so central so quiet where become an ago by the front of the back at all hours when in the very vast of the traffic there is gone to notice
we shall go there and search that house
and when we learn what it holds then we do what our friend arthur call in his phrases of hunt' stop the earth's' and so we run down our old rosso
is it not
then let us come at once i cried we are wasting the precious precious time
the professor did not move but simply said and how are we to get into that house in piccadilly
anyway
i cried
we shall break in. if near be
and your police
where will they be and what will they say
i was staggered but i knew that if he wished to delay he had a good reason for it
ski said as quietly as i coulddon't wait more than need be
you know i am sure what torture i am in
at my child that i do
and indeed there is now is not me to add to your anguish
but just think what can we do until all the world beat movement
then will come out time
i have thought and thought and it seems to me that the simplest way is the best of all
now we wish to get into the house but we have no key
is it not so
i nodded
now suppose that you were in truth the owner of that house and could not still get in
and think there was to you no conscience of the house breaker what would you do
i should get a respectable locksmith and set him to work to pick the lock for me
and your police they would interfere would they not
oh no
not if they knew the man was properly employed
then he looked at me as keenly as he spoke all that is in doubt is the conscience of the employer and the belief of your policemen as to whether or not that employer has a good conscience or a bad one
your police must indeed be zealous men and clever oh so clever in reading the heart that they trouble themselves in such matter
mono my friend jonathan you to take the kick off a hundred empty houses in this your london or of any city in the world and if you do it as such things are rightly done and at the time such things are rightly done no one will interfere
i have read of a gentleman who owned as of one house in london and when he went for months of summer to switzerland and lock up his house some burglar come and broke window at back and got in
then he went and made open the shutters in front and walk out and in through the door before the very eyes of the police
then he have an auction in that house and advertise it and put up big notice
and when the day come he sell off by a great auctioneer all the goods of that other man who own them
then he go to a builder and me sell him that house making an agreement that he pull it down and take all away within a certain time
and your police and other authority help him all they can
and when that owner come back from his holiday in switzerland he find only an empty hole where his house had been
this was all consent egos and in our worker shall be enderle top
we shall not go clearly that the policemen who have them little to think it shall deem it strange
but we shall go after teno'clock when there are many about and such things would be done were we indeed owners of the house
i could not but see how right he was and the terrible despair of mina's face became relaxed in thought
there was hope in such good counsel
van helsing went on when once within that house we may find more clues
at any rate some of use an remain there whilst the rest find the other places where there be more earth boxes at bermondsey and mile end
lord godalming stood up
i can be of some us where he said
i shall wise to my people to have horses and carriages where they will be most convenient
look here old fellow said morris it is a capital idea to have allready in case we want to go horseback ing butdon't you think that one of your snappy carriages with its heraldic adornments in any way of walworth or mile end would attract too much attention for our purpose
it seems to me that we ought to take cabs when we go south of east
and even leave them somewhere near the neighbourhood we are going to
friend quincey is right
said the professor
his head is what you call in plane with the horizon
it is a difficult thing that we go to do and we do not want no peoples to watch us if so it may
mina took a growing interest in every y bing and i was rejoiced to see that the exigency of affairs wash wiping her to forget for a time the terrible experience of the night
she was very very pale almost ghastly and within that her lips were drawn away showing her teeth in somewhat of prominence
i did not mention this last lest it should give her needles spain buy it made my blood run cold in my veins to think of what had occurred with poor list when the count has sucked her blood
as yet there was no sign of the teeth growing sharper but the time as yet was short and there was time for fear
when we came to the discussion of the sequence of our efforts and of the disposition of our forces there were new sources of doubt
it was finally agreed that before starting for piccadilly we should destroy the count's lair close at hand
in case he should find it out too soon we should thus be still ahead of him in our work of destruction
and his presence in his purely material shape and at his weakest might give us some new clue
as to the disposal of forces it was suggested by the professor that after our visit to cart as we should all enter the house in piccadilly
that the two doctors and i should remain there whilst lord godalming and quincey found the pairs at walworth and mile end and destroyed them
it was possible if not likely the professor urged that the count might appear in piccadilly during the day and that if so we might be able to cope with him then and there
at any rate we might be able to follow him info rss
to this plan i strenuously objected and so far as my going was concerned for i said that i intended to stay and protect mina
i thought that my mind was made upon the subject burkina would not listen to my objection
she said that there might become law matter in which i could be useful
that amongst the count's papers might be some clue which i could understand out of my experience in transylvania
and that as it was all the strength we could muster was required to cope with the count's extraordinary power
i had to give in for mina's resolution was fixed
she said that it was the last hope for her that we should all work together
as for me she said i have no fear
things have been as bad as they can be
and whatever may happen must have init some element of hope of comfort
to my husband
god can if he wishes it guard me as well alone as with anyone present
so i started up crying out then in god's name let us come at once for we are losing time
the count may come to piccadilly earlier than we think
not so
said van helsing holding up his hand
but why
i asked
do you forget he said with actually a smile that last night he banquet ed heavily and will sleep late
did i forget
shall i ever
can lever
can any of us ever forget that terrible scene
mina struggled hard to keep her brave countenance but the pain over mastered her and she put her hands before her face and shuddered whilst she moaned
van helsing had not intended to recall her frightful experience
he had simply lost sight of her and her part in the affair in his intellectual effort
when it struck him what he said he was horrified at his thoughtlessness and tried to comfort her
oh madam min she said dear dear madam min salad
that i of all who's preference you should have said anything so forgetful
these stupid old lips of mine and this stupid old head do not deserve so but you will forget it will you not
he bent low beside her as he spoke
she took his hand and looking at him through her tears said hoarsely no i shall not forget for it is well that i remember
and with it i have so much in memory of you that is sweet that i take it all to get her
now you must all be going soon
breakfast is ready and we must all eat that we may be strong
breakfast was a strange meal you wall
we tried to be cheerful and encourage each other and mina was the brightest and most cheerful of us
when it was over van helsing stood up and said now my dear friends we go forth to our terrible enterprise
are we all armed as we were on that night when first we visited our enemy's lair
armed against ghostly as well as carnal attack
we all assured him
then it is well
now madam mina you are in any case quite safe here until the sunset
and before then we shall return
if
we shall return
but before we go let me see you armed against personal attack
i have myself since you came down prepared your chamber by the placing of things of which we know so that he may not enter
now let me guard yourself
on your forehead i touch this piece of sacred water in the name of the father the woman's
there was a fearful scream which almost erode our hearts to hear
as he had placed the water on mina's forehead it had feared it
had burned into the flesh as though it had been a piece of white hot metal
my poor darling's brain had told her the significance of the fact as quickly as her nerves receives the pain of it and the two so overwhelmed her that her overwrought nature had its voice in that dreadful scream
but the words to her thought came quickly
the echo of the scream had not ceased to ring on the air when there came the reaction and she sank on her knees on the floor in an agony of a basement
pulling her beautiful hair over her face as the leper of old his mantle she walked out
uncle am
unclean
even the almighty shuns my polluted flesh
i must bear this mark of shame upon my forehead until the judgement day
they all paused
i had thrown myself beside her in an agony of helpless grief and putting my arms around held her tight
for a few minute four sorrowful hearts beat together whilst the friends around us turned away their eyes that range are silently
then van helsing turned and said gravely
so bravely that i could not help feeling that he was in some way inspired and was stating things outside himself
it may be that you may have to beat that mark tool for himself see fit as he most surely shall on the judgement day to redress all wrongs of the earth and of his children that he has placed there on
and on madam mina my dear my dear may we who love you get here to see when that red scan the sign of god's knowledge of what has been shall pass away and leave your forehead as pure as the heart we know
for so surely as we live that's car shall pass away when god sees right to lift the burden that is hard upon us
till then we hear our cross as his son did in obedience to his will
it may be that we are chosen instruments of his good pleasure and that we ascend to his bidding as that other through stripes and shame
through tears and blood
through doubts and fear and all that makes the difference between god and man
there was hope in his words and comfort
and they made for resignation
mina and i both felt so and simultaneously we each took one of the old man's hands and bent over and kissed it
then without a word we all knelt down together and all holding hands swore to be true to each other
wemen pledged ourselves to raise the veil of sorrow from the head of her whom each in his own way we loved
and we prayed for help and guidance in the terrible task which lay before us
it was then time to start
so i said farewell to mina a parting which neither of us shall forget to our dying day and we set out
to one thing i have made up my mind
if we find out that mona must be a vampire in the end then she shall not go into that unknown and terrible land alone
i suppose it is thus that in old time zone vampire meant many
just as their hideous bodies could only rest in sacred earth so the holiest love was the recruiting sergeant for their ghastly ranks
we entered carfax without trouble and found all things the same as on the first occasion
it was hard to believe that amongst so prosaic surroundings of neglect and dust and decay there was any ground for such fear as already we knew
had not our minds been made up and had the're not been terrible memories to spur us on we could hardly have proceeded with our task
we found no papers of any sign of use in the house
and in the old chapel the great boxes looked just as we had seen them last
dr
van helsing said to us solemnly as we stood before him and now my friends we have a duty here to do
we must sterilize this earth so sacred of holy memories that he has brought from a far distant land for such fell use
he has chosen this earth because it has been holy
thus we defeat him with his own weapon for we make it more holy still
it was sanctified to such use of man now we sanctify it to god
as he spoke he took from his bags screwdriver and a wrench and very soon the top of one of the cases was thrown open
the earth smelled misty and close but we did not somehow seem to mind for our attention was concentrated on the professor
taking from his box a piece of the sacred water he paid it reverently on the earth and then shutting down the lid began to screw it homes raising him as he worked
one by one we treated in the same way each of the great boxes and left them as we had found them to all appearance
but in each was a portion of the host
when we closed the door behind us the professor said solemnly so much is already done
it may be that with all the others we can be so successful then the subset of this evening may shine of madam mina's forehead all white as ivory and with no stain
as we passed across the lawn on our way to the station to catch our train we could see the front of the asylum
i looked eagerly and in the window of my own rooms admins
i waved my hand to her and nodded to tell that our work there was successfully accomplished
she nodded in reply to show that she understood
the last i saw she was waving her hand in farewell
it was with a heavy heart that we sought the station and just caught the train which was steaming in as we reached the platform
i have written this in the train
piccadillyo'clock
just before we reached fenchurch street lord godalming said to be quincey and i will find a locksmith
you had better not come with us in case there should be any difficulty
for under the circumstances itwouldn't seem so bad for us to break into an empty house
but you are a solicitor and the incorporated law society might tell you that you should have known better
i demurred as to my not sharing any danger even if odium but he went on besides it will attract less attention if there are not too many of us
my title will make it all right with the locksmith and with any policeman that may come along
you had better go with jack and the professor and stay in the green park
somewhere in sight of the house and when you see the door opened and the smith has gone away do you all come across
we shall be on the lookout for you and shall let you in
the advice is good
said van helsing so we said no more
godalming and morris hurried off in a cab we following in another
at the corner of arlington street our contingent got out and strolled into the green park
my heart beat as i saw the house on which so much of our hope was centred looking up from and silent in its deserted condition amongst its more lively and spruce looking neighbours
we sat down on a bench within good view and began to smoke cigars so as to attract as little attention as possible
the minutes seemed to pass with leaden feet as we waited for the coming of the others
at length we saw a four wheeler drive up
out of it in leisurely fashion for life godalming and morris
and down from the box descended a thick set working man with his rush woven basket of tools
morris paid the cab man who touched his hat and drove away
together the two ascended the steps and lord godalming pointed out what he wanted done
the workman took off his coat leisurely and hung it on one of the spikes of the rail saying something to a policeman who just then sauntered along
the policeman nodded acquiescence and the man kneeling down placed his bag beside him
after searching through it he took out a selection of tools which he proceeded to lay beside him in orderly fashion
then he stood up looked in the keyhole blew into it and turning to his employers made some remark
lord godalming smiled and the man lifted a good sized bunch of keys
selecting one of them he began to prove the lock as if feeling his way with it
after fumbling about for a bit he tried a second and then a third
all at once the door opened under a slight push from him and he and the two others entered the hall
we sat still
my own cigar burnt furiously buy van helsing's went cold altogether
we waited patiently as we saw the workman come out and bring his bag
then he held the door partly open steadying it with his knees while the fitted a key to the lock
this he finally handed to lord godalming who took out his lures and gave him something
the man touched his hat took his bag put on his coat and departed
not a soul took the slightest notice of the whole transaction
when the man had fairly go news three crossed the street and knocked at the door
it was immediately opened by quincey morris besides him stood lord godalming lighting a cigar
the place smells so vile it said the latter as we came in
it did indeed smell gilroy like the old chapel at carfax and with our previous experience it was plain to us that the count had been using the place pretty freely
we moved to explore the house all keeping together in case of attack for we knew we had ashton vsg daily enemy to deal with an faster we did not know whether the count might not be in the house
in the dining room which lay at the back of the hall we found eight boxes of earth
eight boxes only out of the nine which we sought
our work was not over and would never be until we should have found the missing box
first we opened the shutters of the window which looked out across a narrow stone flagged yard at the blank face of a stable pointed to look like the front of a miniature house
there were no windows in it so we were not afraid of being overlooked
we did not lose any time in examining the cheats
with the tools which we had brought with us we opened them one by one and treated them as we had treated those others in the old chapel
it was evident to us that the countess not at present in the house and we proceeded to search for any of his effects
after a cursory glance at the rest of the rooms from base henry partic we came to the conclusion that the dining room contained any effects which might belong to the count
and so we proceeded to minutely examine them
they lay in a sort of orderly disorder on the great dining room table
there were title deeds of the piccadilly house in a great bundle deeds of the purchase of the houses at mile end and bermondsey note paper envelopes and pens and ink
all were covered up in thin wrapping paper to keep them from the dust
there were also a clothes brush a brush and comb and any hand basin
the latter containing dirty water which was reddened as it with blood
last of all was a little heap of keys of all sorts and sizes probably those belonging to the other houses
when we had examined this last find lord godalming and quincey morris taking accurate notes on the various addresses of the houses in the east and the south took with them the keys in a great bunch and set out to destroy the boxes in these places
the rest of usage with what patience we can waiting their return of the coming of the count
chapter dr
seward's diary october
the time seemed terribly long whilst we were waiting for the coming of godalming and quincey morris
the professor tried to keep our minds active by using them all the time
i could see his beneficent purpose by the side glances which he threw from time to time at harker
the poor fellow is overwhelmed in a misery that is appalling to see
last night he was a frank happy looking man with strong youthful face full of energy and with dark brown hair
today he is a drawn haggard old man whose white hair matches well with the hollow burning eyes and grief written lines of his face
his energy is still intact
in fact he is like a living flame
this may yet be his salvation for it all go well it will give him over the despairing period
he will then in a kind of way wake again to the realities of life
poor fellow i thought my own trouble was bad enough but his
the professor knows this well enough and is doing his best to keep his mind active
what he has been saying was under the circumstances of absorbing interest
so well as i can remember here it is i have studied over and over again since they came into my hands all the papers relating to this mon seat and the mind i have studied the greater seems the necessity to utterly stamp him out
all through there are signs of his advance
not only of his power but of his knowledge of it
as i learned from the researches of my friend arminius of budapest the war in life a most wonderful man
soldier statesman and alchemist which latter was the highest development of the science knowledge of his time
he had a mighty brains learning beyond compare and a heart that knew no fear and no remorse
he dared even to attend the scholomance and there was no branch of knowledge of his time that he did not essay
well in him the brain powers survived the physical death
though it would seem that memory was not all complete
in some faculties of mind he has been and is only a child
but he is growing and some things that were childish at the first are now of man's stature
he is experimenting and doing it well
and if it had not been that we have crossed his path he would be yet he may be yet if retail the father or further et of a new order of beings whose road must lead through death not life
harker groaned and said and this is all arrayed against my darling
but how is he experimenting
the knowledge may help us to defeat him
he has all along since his coming been trying his power slowly but surely
that big child brain of his is working
well for us it is as yet a child train
for had he dared at the first to attempt certain things he would long ago have been beyond our power
however he means to succeed and a man who has centuries before him can afford to wait and to go slow
festina lence may well be his motto
i fail to understand said market wearily
oh done more plain home
perhaps grief and trouble are willing my brain
the professor laid his hand tenderly on his shoulder as he spoke at my child i will be plain
do you not see how of late this monster has been creeping into knowledge experimentally
how he has been making use of the zoo pbx to us patient to effect his entry into friend john's home
for your vampire though in all afterwards he can come when and how he will just at the first make entry only when asked thereto by an inmate
but these are not his most important experiments
does not see how at the first all these so great boxes were moved by others
he knew not then but that must be so
but all the time that so great child brain of his was growing and he began to consider whether he might not himself move the box
so he began to help
and then when he found that this be allright he try to move them alkaline
and some progress and he scatter these graves of him
and none but he know where they are hidden
he may have intend to bury them deep in the ground
so that only be use them in the night or at such time as he can change his form they do him equal well and none may know these are his hiding place
but my child do not despair this knowledge came to him just too late
already all of his pairs but one be sterilize as for him
and before the sunset this shall be so
then he have no place where he can move and hide
i delayed this morning that so we might be sure
is there not more at stake for us than for him
then why not be more careful than him
by my clock it is one hour and already if all be well friend arthur and quincey are on their way to us
today is our day and we must go sure if slow and lose no chance
see
there are five of us when those absent one's return
whilst we were speaking we were startled by a knock at the hall door the double postman's knock of the telegraph boy
we all moved out to the hall with one impulse and van helsing holding up his hand to us to keep sole jar stepped to the door and opened it
the non handed in a dispatch
the professor closed the door again and after looking at the direction opened it and read aloud
lookout for d
he has just now come from carfax hurriedly and hastened towards the south
he seems to be going the round and may want to see you mina
there was a pause broken by jonathan harker's voice now for he thanked we shall soon meet
van helsing turned to him quickly and said god will act in his own way and time
do not fear and do not rejoice as yet
for what we wish for at the moment maybe our own undoing s
i care for nothing now he answered hotly except to wipe out this brute from the face of creation
i would sell my soul to do it
oh hush hush my child
said van helsing
god does not purchase souls in this wise and the devil though he may purchase does not keep faith
but god is merciful and just and knows your pain and your devotion to that dear madam mina
think you how her pain would be doubled did she but hear your wild words
do not fear any of us we are all devoted to this cause and today shall see the end
the time is coming for action
today this vampire is limit to the powers of man and hill sunset he may not change
it will take him time to arrive here see it is twenty minutes past one and there are yet sometimes before he can higher come b whenever so quick
what we must hope for is that my lord arthur and quincey arrive first
about half an hour after we had received mrs.
harker's telegram there came a quiet resolute knock at the hall door
it was just an ordinary knock such as is given hourly by thousands of gentlemen but it made the professor's heart and mine beat loudly
we looked at eachother and together moved out into the tall
we each held ready to use our various armaments the spiritual in the left hand the mortal in the right
van helsing pulled back the latch and holding the door half open stood back having both hands ready for action
the gladness of our hearts must have shown upon our faces when on the step close to the door we saw lord godalming and quincey morris
they came quick kyiv and closed the door behind them the former saying as they moved along the hall it is allright
we found both places
six boxes in each and we destroyed them all
destroyed
asked the professor
for him
we were silent for a minute and then quincey said there's nothing to do but to wait here
if however hedoesn't turn up by fiveo'clock we must start off
for itwon't do to leave mrs.
market alone after sunset
he will be here before long now said van helsing who had been consulting his pocket book
nota bene in madam's telegram he went south from carfax
that means he went to cross the river and he could only do so at a lack of tide which should be something before oneo'clock
that he went south has a meaning for us
he is as yet only suspicious and he went from carfax first to the place where he would suspect interference least
you must have been at bermondsey only a short time before him
that he is not here already shows that he went to mile end next
this took him some time for he would then have to be carried over the river in some way
believe me my friends we shall not have long to wait now
we should have ready some plan of attack so that we may throw away no chance
bush there is no time now
have all your arms
be ready
he held up a warning hand as he spoke for we all could hear a key softly inserted in the lock of the hall door
i could not but admire even at such a moment the way in which a dominant spirit asserted itself
in all our hunting parties and adventures in different parts of the world quincey morris had always been the one to arrange the plan of action and arthur and i had been accustomed to obey him implicitly
now the old habit seemed to be renewed instinctively
with a swift glance around the room heat once laid out our plan of attack and without speaking a word with a gesture placed us each in position
van helsing market and i were just behind the door so that when it was opened the professor could guard it whilst we two stepped between the income rand the door
godalming behind and quincey in front stood just out of sight ready to move in front of the window
we waited in a suspense that made the second class with nightmares lowndes
the slow careful steps came along the hall
the count was evidently prepared for some surprise at least he feared it
suddenly with a single bound he leaped into the room
winning a way past us before any of us could raise a hand to stay him
there was something so panther like in the movement something so inhuman that it seemed to sober us all from the shock of his coming
the first to act was marked who with a quick movement threw himself before the door leading into the room in the front of the house
as the counts as is a horrible sort of sharp passed over his face showing the eye teeth long and pointed
but the evil smile as quickly passed into a cold state of lion like disdain
his expression again changed as with a single impulse we all advanced upon him
it was a pity that we had not some better organized plan of attack for even at the moment i wondered what we were to do
i did not myself know whether our lethal weapons would avail us anything
harker evidently meant to try the matter for he had read this greatly uri knife and made a fierce and sudden cut at him
the flow was a powerful one only the diabolical quickness of the count's leap back saved him
a second less and the trenchant blade had short through his heart
as it was the point just cut the cloth of his coat making a wide gap whence a bundle of banknotes and a stream of good fell out
the expression of the count's face was so hellish that for a moment i feared for harker though i saw him throw the terrible knife aloft again for another stroke
instinctively i moved forward with a protective impulse holding the crucifix and water in my left hand
i felt a mighty power fly along my arm and it was without surprise that i saw the monster cower back before a similar movement made spontaneously by each one of us
it would be impossible to describe the expression of hate and baffled malignity of anger and hellish rate which came over the count's face
his waxen the became greenish yellow by the contrast of his burning eyes and the red scar on the forehead showed on the pallid skin like a palpitating sound
the next instant with a sinuous dive he swept under harker's adhere his blow could fall and grasping a handful of the money from the floor dashed across the room threw himself at the window
amid the crash and glitter of the falling glass he tumbled into the flanges area below
through the sound of the shivering glass i could hear the ring of the good as some of the sovereigns fell on the flagging
we ran over and saw him spring unhurt from the ground
he rushing up the steps crossed the flagged yard and pushed open the stable door
there he turned and spoke to us
you think to baffle me you with your pale face call in a row like sheep in a butcher's
you shall be sorry yet each one of you
you think you have left me without a place to rest but i have more
my revenge is just begun
i spread it over centuries and time is on my side
your girls that you all love are mine already
and through them you and others shall get behind my creatures to do my bidding and to be ny jackals when i want to feed
bah
with a contemptuous sheer he passed quickly through the door and we heard the rusty foot cream as he fastened it behind him
a door beyond opened and shut
the first of us to speak was the processor
realizing the difficulty of following him through the stable we moved toward the hall
we have learnt something
much
notwithstanding his brave words he fears us
he fears time he fears want
for if not why he hurry sl
his very tone betray him or my ears receive
why take that money
you follow quick
you are hunters of the wild beast and understand it so
for me i make sure that nothing here may be of use to him if so that he returns
as he spoke he put the money remaining in his pocket took the title deeds in the bundle as marker had left them and swept the remaining things into the open fireplace where he set fire to them with a match
godalming and morris had rushed out into the yard and market had lowered himself from the window to follow the count
he had however bolted the stable door and by the time they had forced it open there was no sign of him
van helsing and i tried to make inquiry at the back of the house
but the jews was deserted and no one had seen him depart
it was no flats in the afternoon and sunset was not far off
we had to recognize that our game was up
with heavy hearts we agreed with the professor when he said let us go back to madam mina
poor poor dear madam mina
all we can do just now is done and we can there at least protect her
but we need not despair
there is but one more earth box and we must try to find it
when that is done all may yet be well
i could see that he spoke as bravely as he could to comfort harker
the poor fellow was quite broken down now and again he gave a low grown which he could not suppress
he was thinking of his wife
with sav hearts we came back to my house where we found mrs.
harker waiting us with an appearance of cheerfulness which did honour to her bravery and unselfishness
when she saw our faces her own became a spake as death
for a second or two her eyes were closed as if she were in secret prayer
and then she said cheerfully i can never thank you all enough
oh my poor darling
as she spoke she took her husband's greyhead in her hands and kissed it
lay your poor head here and test it
all will get be well dear
god will protect us if he so will it in his good intent
the poor fellow groaned
there was no place for words in his sublime misery
we had a sort of perfunctory supper together and i think it cheered us all up somewhat
it was perhaps the mere animal heat of food to hungry people for bone of us had eaten anything since breakfast or the sense of companionship may have helped us but anyhow we were all less miserable and saw the morro was not altogether without hope
true to our promise we told mrs.
harker everything which had passed
and although she grew snowy white at times when danger had seemed to threaten her husband and red at others when his we go to onto her was manifested she listened bravely and with calmness
when we came to the part where marker had rushed at the count so recklessly she clung to her husband's arm and held it tight as though her clinging could protect him from any harm that might come
she said nothing however till the narration was all done and matters had been brought up to the pre sent time
then without letting go her husband's hand she stood up amongst us and spoke
oh that i could give any idea of the scene
of that sweet sweet good good woman in all the radiant beauty of her youth and an imation with the red scar on her forehead of which she was conscious and which we saw with grinding of our teeth remembering whence and how it came
her loving kindness against our grim hate
her tender faith against all our fears and doubting
and we knowing that so far as symbols went she with all her goodness and purity and faith was outcast from god
jonathan she said and the word sounded like music on her lips it was so full of love and tenderness jonathan dear and you all my true true friends i want you to hear something in mind through all this dreadful time
i know that you must fight
that you must destroy even as you destroyed the false lucy so that the true lucy might live hereafter
but it is not a work of hate
that poor soul who has wrought all this misery is the saddest case of all
just think what will be his joy when he too is destroyed in his dorset part that his better part may have spiritual immortality
you must be pitiful to him too though it may not hold your hands from his destruction
as she spoke i could see her husband's face darken and draw together as though the passion in him were shrivel in this being to its core
instinctively the clasp on his wife's hand grew closer till his knuckles looked white
she did not flinch from the pain which i knew she must have suffered but looked at him with eyes that were more appealing than ever
as she stopped speaking he leaped to his feet almost tearing his hand from here as he spoke
may god give him into my hand just for long enough to destroy that earthly life of him which we are aiming at
if beyond it i could send his soul forever and ever to burning hell i would do it
oh bush
oh bush in the name of the good god
don't say such things jonathan my husband or you will crush me with fear and horror
just think my dear
i have been thinking all this long long day of it
that
perhaps
someday
i too may need such pity and that some other like you and with equal cause for anger may deny it to me
oh my husband
my husband indeed i would have soared you such a thought had there been another way
but i pray that god may not have treasured your wild words except as the heart broken wall of a very loving and sorely stricken man
oh god let these poor white hairs go in evidence of what he has suffered who all his life has done no wrong and on whom so many sorrows have come
we men were all in years now
there was no resisting the hands swept openly
she wept too to see that her sweeter counsel's had prevailed
her husband flung himself on his knees beside her and putting his arms round her hid his face in the folds of her dress
van helsing beckoned to us and we stood out of the room leaving the two loving heart's alone with their god
before they retired the professor fixed up the room against any coming of the vampire and assured mrs.
marker that she might rest in peace
she tried to school herself to the belief and manifestly for her husband's sake tried to seem content
it was a brave struggle and was i think and believe not without its reward
van helsing had placed at hand abell which either of them was to sound in case of any emergency
when they had retired quincey godalming and i arranged that we should sit up dividing the night between us and watch over the safety of the poor stricken lady
the first watch falls to quincey so the rest of us shall be off to get as soon as we can
godalming has already turned into this is the second watch
now that my work is done i too shall go to bed
jonathan harker's journal october close to midnight
i thought yesterday would never end
there was over me a yearning for sleep in some sort of blind belief that to wake would be to find things changed and that any change must now be for the better
before we parted we discuss w x what our next step was to be but we could arrive at no result
all we knew was that one earth box remained and that the count alone knew where it was
if he chooses to lie hidden he may baffle us for years
and in the meantime the thought is too horrible i dare not think of it even now
this i know that if ever there was a woman who was all perfection that one is my poor wronged darling
i loved her a thousand times more for her sweet pity of last night a pity that made my own hate of the monster seem despicable
surely god will not permit the world to be the poorer by the loss of such a creature
this is hope to me
we are all drifting re edwards now and faith is out only anchor
thank god
